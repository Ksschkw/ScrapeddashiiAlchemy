    "what_is_abdominal_pain": "Abdominal pain – often called stomach ache – is a common condition that almost everyone experiences at some point in their life. That’s because there are many possible causes for abdominal pain. It can develop without a diagnosable underlying condition. However, it can also be caused by digestive problems, inflammations, or infections. Abdominal pain can vary in intensity and people can experience it very differently. It is often linked to nausea, vomiting, or digestive problems . Virtually everyone can develop a stomach ache, but the condition is more common among young women.\n\nA medical check-up can help to rule out other conditions as the cause of abdominal pain. However, in most cases it can be managed at home without outside intervention. There are common home remedies for this condition like certain teas, massages, light exercise and a proper diet. If it is not caused by any other condition, abdominal pain usually subsides within a few hours. If you have abdominal pain and want to learn more about possible causes, you can download the Ada App for a symptom assessment.",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Most commonly, abdominal pain develops without a specific cause . In these cases, doctors cannot diagnose a specific condition. Often the stomach ache can be treated at home and subsides within a few hours. Almost all people develop abdominal pain during their lifetime. This is not necessarily a sign of an underlying illness. However, if the pain is ongoing or frequently recurs, a doctor should be consulted to rule out other possible causes. There’s a chance that abdominal pain can recur regularly over a period of more than 6 months without any identifiable cause. In that case, it’s possible that so-called functional abdominal pain has developed. 1\n\nAbdominal pain can be caused by various conditions, including: Gastrointestinal conditions, for example infections, inflammations or ulcers A variety of digestive problems Conditions affecting the liver, kidney, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, appendix , bladder or the heart, lungs, or the spine Metabolic disorders Psychological or psychosomatic causes, for example anxiety or panic attacks In case of doubt, a doctor should be consulted. 2\n\nSometimes, abdominal pain develops immediately or several hours after a meal . In these cases there are often underlying digestive problems most frequently associated with fatty foods. This can lead to bloating in the intestines. The following foods can cause digestive problems and abdominal pain: Raw vegetables Legumes like beans Broccoli or Brussels sprouts Large amounts of sweets Fatty meals like roasts. Other causes for abdominal pain after meals are heartburn, gallstones , or food intolerances. These conditions need to be diagnosed by a medical expert.",
    "what_are_symptoms": "Abdominal pain is often accompanied by other symptoms , for example: 3 Nausea Vomiting Flatulence Diarrhea Constipation It is important to pay attention to where and when the pain occurs. This information can be helpful for doctors during an examination. 4 The answers to the following questions can be especially useful: Is the pain located in the upper or lower abdomen or around the navel? Is the pain moving or static? Does the pain feel sharp or pressing? Does the pain occur in the morning, evening, at night or only after meals? Do these symptoms sound familiar? Try Ada to find out more.",
    "how_is_abdominal_pain_diagnosed": "Like many kinds of pain, abdominal pain cannot be diagnosed through any kind of test. For most individuals, pain can vary greatly in its intensity. There are different methods to try and measure pain severity, for example through a scale from 0 (= no pain at all) to 10 (= worst pain imaginable). For abdominal pain it’s important to rule out other conditions as a cause .",
    "how_can_abdominal_pain_be_treated": "As a rule of thumb for abdominal pain self-care: If it feels good, it is good. Conversely, this implies: If it feels uncomfortable, it should be avoided. Many people report, that some of these measures can help ease the pain: 5 Calming teas, such as chamomile, aniseed, cumin or fennel Warmth, for example through a hot-water bottle or a cherry pit pillow Light exercise like a walk Plenty of rest Avoiding stress Plenty of fluids, especially if there is diarrhea Soft clockwise belly massages A relaxing atmosphere, for example through calming music\n\nOften, the right diet can help remedy abdominal pain. These healthy eating habits are recommended for people with stomach aches: Light, low-fat food Grated apples or bananas (no sour citrus fruits) Rusk, rice, and pasta Carrots, fennel, or pumpkin (steamed or cooked) As little dairy as possible Plenty of fluids (at least 1.5 liters per day for adults) No alcohol\n\nThere are over-the-counter pain medications available at shops and pharmacies. These can often help ease abdominal pain. Pharmacists can also recommend additional herbal remedies . Mixes of various herbal extracts are very commonly used. 6 Probiotics can help develop a healthy gut flora. However, it is always important to read the patient information leaflet.",
    "when_should_you_go_see_a_doctor": "Usually, abdominal pain is not a cause for concern. However, it might be a good idea to address your problems during the next visit to the doctor’s. A doctor should be consulted if the abdominal pain: 3 Becomes more severe Becomes unbearable Changes Recurs frequently Remains longer than two days\n\nIf the abdominal pain is accompanied by other severe problems like shortness of breath, disturbance of consciousness, or bleeding , you should make an emergency call .",
    "how_can_abdominal_pain_be_prevented": "There is no universal method to prevent abdominal pain. But there are different approaches based on an individual’s personal situation and underlying causes of the pain. Many people suggest, that these methods can help prevent abdominal pain: A balanced diet Awareness of allergies and food intolerance Stress avoidance Fewer alcoholic drinks and tobacco products Regular exercise or long walks Consistent treatment of known conditions",
    "can_abdominal_pain_be_cured": "If abdominal pain is not caused by an underlying condition, it generally subsides after a few hours without additional treatment. Most conditions that cause abdominal pain are easy to treat. If the pain becomes intense or remains for a long time, a doctor should be consulted. Proper treatment can effectively ease the pain."

    "condition": "Achilles Tendonitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/achilles-tendonitis/",
    "what_is_achilles_tendonitis": "Achilles tendonitis, also known as Achilles tendinopathy or Achilles tendinitis, is a condition affecting the Achilles tendon . The Achilles tendon is a large tendon which attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. When the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged, usually through overuse, a person has developed Achilles tendonitis and will experience pain. This condition mostly affects athletic and active people, especially mature adults between the ages of 30 and 50. The incidence rate is around five to 10 people in 100,000. 1 Treatment is usually simple and mainly involves resting from the specific exercises that cause the pain. This will often be supplemented by regenerative/rehabilitative stretching exercises, most often tailored to the person and taught by a physical therapist. Most people recover from Achilles tendonitis without any lasting effects .",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptom of Achilles tendonitis is pain in the back of the foot and heel . The onset of pain may be sudden or gradual. 2 Symptoms of Achilles tendonitis include: 3 4 Pain at the back of the foot and heel when moving the ankle Pain when pointing the toes , or pushing off from the toes Pain which becomes worse after exercising Stiffness along the back of the foot and heel, especially with the first steps in the morning Swelling and tenderness in the back of the foot and heel Thickening of the tendon Bone spurs in cases of insertional tendonitis (see insertional Achilles tendonitis ) People experiencing possible symptoms of Achilles tendonitis should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The Achilles tendon is a large, thick tendon that attaches the calf muscles to the bony heel of the foot. This tendon bears the weight of the body when pushing off from the toes in the act of walking or running. Achilles tendonitis most often occurs when the tendon becomes inflamed or damaged through overuse . Risk factors for developing Achilles tendonitis include: 3 4 5 Suddenly increasing the amount or intensity of exercise Not stretching out the calf muscles properly after exercise Running or exercising to excess Running on hard surfaces Jumping repeatedly during exercise or sports Manual labour which puts stress on ankles and feet Having bone spurs (osteophytes) which rub against the Achilles tendon Not wearing sufficiently supportive shoes for exercise Having flattened arches in the foot Although Achilles tendonitis is commonly referred to as tendonitis, the condition does not always involve inflammation of the tendon . Over time, tendons ‒ including the Achilles tendon ‒ degenerate. When this happens, they become damaged and lose elasticity. Pain which is caused by this progressive degeneration is called Achilles tendinosis, or sometimes Achilles tendinopathy; however tendinopathy is technically an umbrella term for tendonitis and tendinosis. 5\n\n55 to 65 percent of Achilles tendonitis cases are classified as noninsertional Achilles tendonitis: the fibers in the center of the Achilles tendon begin to degenerate or become inflamed, swell and become thicker. 4\n\nInsertional Achilles tendonitis occurs when the Achilles tendon degenerates or gets inflamed at the point where the tendon attaches, or inserts, to the heel bone. Bone spurs, projections that develop along bone edges, also known as osteophytes may form in cases of insertional Achilles tendonitis. 4 7\n\nA complication of Achilles tendonitis can be an Achilles tendon rupture. A rupture occurs when a tendon tears , partially or completely, after being stretched beyond its capacity. Achilles tendonitis can increase the chances of a rupture occurring. 8 9 Around 80 percent of Achilles tendon ruptures occur during exercise and while playing sports. People most commonly develop the condition between the ages of 30 and 50. 1 The antibiotic class fluoroquinolones which, among many others, includes ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, may cause Achilles tendon rupture, even after a short course. Corticosteroid injections into the heel can also increase a person’s risk of developing Achilles tendon rupture. 10 7",
    "diagnosis": "Achilles tendonitis can usually be diagnosed based on the symptoms, following a physical examination of the ankle and tendon. Other tests may be needed in more serious cases of Achilles tendonitis to establish the extent of the problem. These may include: 3 4 X-ray , which does not produce images of tendons but can reveal hardening (calcification) of tendons, as well as bone spurs Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , which uses magnets and radio waves to look inside the body to produce detailed images of tendons, muscles and other soft tissue and may be of use when planning surgery",
    "treatment": "Most people with Achilles tendonitis will be treated with non-surgical options. Rest is vital to allow the Achilles tendon to heal . Any exercise or activity that causes pain should be stopped until the pain subsides. Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, this could take six months or longer. In severe cases, an immobilization boot may be necessary for a few weeks to reduce stress on the foot. An immobilization boot, also known as a walking boot or walking cast, is a removable alternative to a plaster cast, often used to aid healing after fracturing a bone or bone surgery. A splint worn at night has also been shown to temporarily reduce pain. 4 5 12 Physical therapy and exercises are recommended to help strengthen the calf muscles , which reduces stress on the Achilles tendon. Training programmes that focus on a particular type of muscle exercise, known as eccentric training, have been shown to help particularly well in cases of tendonitis. A common exercise is standing on a step and slowly lowering the heel, though a physical therapist can advise on the most appropriate exercises and demonstrate how to perform them. 60 to 90 percent of people who use eccentric exercises to strengthen their Achilles tendon report pain relief. 4 12 13 14 Ice, in the form of ice in a bag or an ice pack, can be applied to the affected area which may help reduce swelling. However, recent studies suggest ice may be more effective at treating inflammatory conditions such as paratenonitis, a condition where the tendon sheath around a tendon becomes inflamed, than tendonitis itself. 3 5 14 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can also help provide pain relief. If the tendon is not inflamed, painkillers such as paracetamol may be  effective at relieving pain, too. NSAIDs should not be taken for long periods of time, as this can result in the development of side effects, such as stomach upsets and damage to the tissue of the gastrointestinal system. If needed, doctors can recommend appropriate painkillers for long-term use. 4 15 Studies have shown that glycerol trinitrate ointment, applied daily as a patch for six months, reduces pain and can help improve outcomes for people with Achilles tendonitis. 12 Shock-wave therapy is a procedure that increases blood flow to an injured area, speeding up the healing process by using a device to pass low-energy sound waves into the body. Studies have shown the treatment to be promising for treating Achilles tendonitis. 14 If Achilles tendonitis injuries take a long time to heal, a treatment where the person’s blood is taken from the arm vein and separated to extract platelet-rich plasma, which is then injected back into the tendon site , may be an option. However, while the evidence suggests few harmful side effects, there is still discussion around the treatment’s effectiveness. 13 Good to know: Corticosteroid injections may help to reduce inflammation and pain on a short term basis, but are not generally recommended for Achilles tendonitis, because they make the tendon more likely to rupture, especially if multiple, recurrent injections are given. 7\n\nWhere Achilles tendonitis fails to respond to non-surgical methods after six months, surgery may be necessary . There are a number of surgical procedures available, depending on the nature and location of the injury. A surgeon will recommend the best option. Possible procedures include: 4 17 Debridement and repair, which removes damaged parts of the tendon. This may be performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged Debridement with tendon transfer may be performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with other tendon tissue, often taken from the long tendon of the big toe Gastrocnemius recession, which lengthens the calf muscle to place less stress on the Achilles tendon Bone spur removal, in cases of insertional tendonitis. Artificial anchors may be implanted to attach the tendon to the bone",
    "prevention": "There are a number of ways to help prevent Achilles tendonitis: 5 Taking care to warm up the body gently but properly, with light exercise before running or sprinting, such as brisk walking for a few minutes Gradually increase the duration and intensity of exercise Cool down after exercise, such as by changing to (brisk) walking for a few minutes after running or sprinting Stretching fully after exercising Strengthen calf muscles to reduce stress on the Achilles tendon Use supportive footwear while exercising or playing sports If pain does occur, it is wise to rest the foot until receiving a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent a more severe injury developing. If a person experiences Achilles pain for the first time or it persists, they should seek medical treatment.",

    "condition": "Acne Vulgaris",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acne-vulgaris/",
    "what_is_acne_vulgaris": "Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a chronic or recurrent skin disease in which the pores (hair follicles) of the skin clog up and can become inflamed. Depending on the degree of severity, this can lead to blackheads (comedones), pimples, knots, and scars occurring in groups. The face is most frequently affected, other localizations are back and chest. Most people are affected for some time during their lives. The disease typically occurs between the ages of 10 and 30 and usually disappears with age. In adolescence, men are affected more frequently than women, while women suffer more frequently from acne in adulthood than men. It is the most common skin disease in adolescence and young adulthood. The disease can lead to considerable psychological stress in those affected but usually does not cause long-term health problems. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 If you think that you might have acne, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Acne typically occurs for the first time at the beginning of puberty. Pimples are caused by a combination of four different factors. A group of hormones (known as androgens) trigger an increase in sebum production on the skin. Dead skin cells and sebum can clog the pores of the skin. This forms blackheads, also known as comedones. Also, bacteria colonizing the pores, which are called Cutibacterium acne or propionibacteria, can cause an inflammatory reaction. The body's immune system gets activated by this, which leads to inflammatory cells migrating towards the affected area and increasing inflammation. Eventually, painful and swollen pimples can form. With a change in hormonal balance, acne often improves in early adulthood but can also last longer. Ultimately, genetics is decisive for the development, course, and severity of acne. However, acne is not caused by a single gene, but instead by a series of genes that influence the probability of disease. There are also a number of triggers that can make the development of acne more likely to happen or to affect its progression. These are: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Mechanical irritation of the affected skin area (e.g. by scratching, pressing, or pulling as well as wearing tight-fitting clothing such as headbands, bras, or backpacks) Application of cosmetics, hair products, and soaps Certain medications (creams and tablets containing cortisone,   lithium, some antiepileptics, etc.) Certain metabolic diseases Menstrual cycle in women Sunlight can contribute to the improvement but also to the worsening of acne – in any case, it promotes skin aging Nutrition (worsening of acne through consumption of dairy products and sugary foods, particularly chocolate) Climatic conditions (worsening of acne in humid climate) Being overweight Stress",
    "what_are_symptoms": "The typical symptoms of acne are blackheads (comedones), pimples, or nodes of the skin. The spots are often on the face, but other parts of the body can also be affected, such as shoulders, back, and chest. They usually occur in groups. The skin around and above these spots is sometimes reddened and painful. Over time, the affected skin may become darker or scarred. Only in extremely rare and severe cases do symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and general fatigue occur. Since acne often represents a psychological burden for those affected, additional symptoms can occur, such as depression , anxiety , and social isolation. Here you can find a description of the different skin symptoms of acne: 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 1) Noninflammatory: comedonal acne: closed comedones (\"whiteheads\"): small round lesions containing whitish material (sebum and dead skin cells). open comedones: small round lesions that look like dark spots   on the surface 2) Inflammatory: Affected areas are red and can be painful ) Mild/moderate acne: Small, reddish spots and bumps that may be filled with pus and have developed from comedones ) Nodulocystic acne: Most severe form of acne Palpable hardenings and knots of the skin larger than 5 mm and usually lie in the area of the back and neck Scars may form during healing If you think that you might have acne, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "how_is_acne_diagnosed": "The diagnosis of acne is based on the medical history and the physical examination of the affected person. A doctor diagnoses acne by carrying out an extensive examination of the skin. The doctor will document where the acne is located and how severe it is. These factors are important in deciding which treatment measures to take. It is also important to ask about current medications, as these could be potential triggers. Further tests or examinations are usually not necessary. In rare cases, if the treatment is unsuccessful, hormonal tests or bacterial cultures can sometimes be analyzed. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_acne": "The treatment of acne depends on the severity of the disease. The following information should be obtained before starting any treatment: 6 Severity? (comedones, pimples, knots) Location? Skin type? (dry, greasy) Scarring present or not? Skin darkened by hyperpigmentation or not? Information pertaining to the menstrual cycle in women? Signs of masculine body hair in women present or not? Current skin care practices? Existing acne treatment? Eurrently used cosmetics? Eurrent medication? Internal psychological strain present or not? In the case of very mild acne, it can sometimes be sufficient to carry out simple steps such as regular but not excessive face washing, eating a balanced diet, and avoiding cosmetics and greasy creams. However, if the acne is severe or if the mild acne does not improve after implementing the steps described above, a number of different medications are available. These are either applied to the skin as a topical or taken as a tablet. Some are available over the counter, while others require a doctor's prescription. In general, the drugs used to treat acne target one or more of these key factors: 6 Excessive growth of hair follicles Abnormal amount of dead, rough skin layers Increased sebum production Bacterial overgrowth Inflammation Some of the most common medications to be applied directly to the skin are: 7 , 6 Retinoids: The so-called topical retinoids are beneficial for both comedonal (noninflammatory) and inflammatory acne They should be included in the initial treatment of most patients They have an anti-inflammatory effect and prevent the formation of further comedones (blackheads) Benzoyl peroxide: This medication is available without prescription in pharmacies It effectively cleanses the skin from bacteria, loosens pores, and reduces inflammation In some cases, benzoyl peroxide can be used in combination with antibiotics, which are prescription only Always consult your doctor or pharmacist before starting any treatment Topical antibiotics: This form of antibiotics should also be applied as an ointment to the affected skin areas With this treatment, the bacteria growing on the inside of the   pores are killed This effectively reduces the inflammation caused by the bacteria However, antibiotics have limited effectiveness in combating comedones A prescription is required Some of the most common medication taken in tablet form is: 3 Oral antibiotics: Systemic antibiotics are an important component in the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne. They have an anti-inflammatory effect and are available only on prescription Hormonal therapies: Some hormonal therapies may be effective in the treatment of acne Estrogen can be prescribed for women to reduce sebum production In addition, it reduces the production of androgens in the ovaries Also, a drug called spironolactone can be used in the treatment of acne. It binds to the androgen receptor, which reduces androgen production. Isotretinoin: Isotretinoin is a systemic retinoid that is highly effective in the treatment of severe acne. Isotretinoin is anti-inflammatory and reduces sebum secretion",
    "best_methods_to_prevent_acne": "The development of acne is predominantly genetic. However, there are some measures that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of acne occurring or to positively influence its course. These effective measures are among others: 5 , 8 Keep your face clean: The face should be cleaned twice daily with warm water and mild soap to remove impurities and dead skin cells from the surface. However, you should avoid washing your face too often or using aggressive soaps. Washing frequently can lead to skin irritation and make symptoms worse Diet and exercise: A balanced diet and regular exercise can have a beneficial effect on general health, stress levels, and consequently, acne. After exercising, you should wash off your sweat as soon as possible Avoid cosmetics: Not wearing make-up or other cosmetics can help prevent an acne outbreak. Any make-up used should be oil-free and not comedogenic Use shampoo: If the hair is particularly greasy, shower once daily with shampoo Do not touch the acne: Avoid touching the acne all day long; this includes squeezing pimples or scratching the affected areas. This allows natural healing Avoid excessive exposure to sunlight and sunbeds: Sunlight can contribute to the improvement but also to the worsening of acne. Too much sunlight and the use of solariums   can damage the skin and is therefore not recommended",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_acne": "Acne typically improves when people grow out of puberty, but it can persist into adulthood. Around 3 percent of adults suffer from acne over the age of 35. For most people with acne, there are no long-term consequences. However, it is important to keep in mind that this condition can also have a psychological impact and even rarely, it can lead to mortality – due to suicide. Severe acne and lack of treatment can lead to permanent scarring in the affected skin areas. This can cause feelings of low self-esteem and anxiety that can impact one's social life and even employment. 5 , 7 , 2 Patients who are about to undergo treatment should follow the treatment plan discussed with their doctor for at least two to three months before deciding on the effectiveness and further course of action.Acne usually takes a long time to develop and typically repeats itself over many years, so maintenance therapy is an important part of the treatment. 6\n\nQ: Is acne hereditary? A: Yes, genetics is crucial for the development, course, and severity of acne. However, acne is not caused by a single gene, but instead by a series of genes that influence the probability of disease. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Q: Can acne ever pose a serious risk to your health? A: Acne does not pose a direct health risk, but in some cases, it can cause permanent scarring to the skin. If your acne does not respond to treatment, you may be referred to a hospital specialist to explore further options. 6 , 2 , 3 Q: What are the types of acne? A: There are different types or stages of acne. These include: 5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 1) Noninflammatory: a) comedonal acne: Closed comedones (\"whiteheads\"): small white spots Open comedones: small dark spots 2) inflammatory: a) mild/moderate acne: Small, reddish spots and bumps that may be filled with pus b) nodulocystic acne: Palpable hardenings and knots of the skin larger than 5 mm Scars may form during healing Q: What is hormonal acne? A: Sebaceous glands are at the center of acne formation. These glands are highly sensitive to hormonal influence. A group of hormones (known as androgens) trigger an increase in sebum production on the skin. These androgens are most active in puberty and young adulthood. That is why acne typically occurs between the ages of 10 and 30 and usually disappears with age. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4"

    "condition": "Acute Appendicitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-appendicitis/",
    "what_is_acute_appendicitis": "Acute appendicitis is an infection of the appendix – the 3 ½-inch-long pouch of tissue attached to the large intestine on the lower right side of the abdomen. This infection and the resulting inflammation can cause symptoms including: Pain Fever Loss of appetite An upset stomach Acute appendicitis is a medical emergency because, if it is not treated, the appendix can burst, and infected material can spread into the abdominal cavity, the part of the body that contains important organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines.. This is a life-threatening situation and must be treated urgently with antibiotics, as well as by removing the infected appendix. An appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix), also known as an appendicectomy, is the most common treatment for acute appendicitis. While the appendix may play a role in young children’s immune system, it serves no known purpose in adults and can be removed via an appendectomy without harmful consequences. 1",
    "acute_appendicitis_symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of appendicitis appear quickly, usually starting with abdominal (stomach) pain . As acute appendicitis can lead to a burst appendix within 24 to 72 hours, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as symptoms begin to appear. The most common initial symptoms include: 1 2 Pain in the upper abdomen or near the navel, starting dull and becoming sharper as it moves to the lower right-hand side. This location is most common, but pain can also occur in other parts of the abdomen. Often, movement worsens the pain. Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Other common symptoms include: Fever and chills Constipation, diarrhea or alternating periods of both Bloating Good to know: Symptoms of a burst appendix include intense abdominal pain in the lower right side that decreases and becomes generalized abdominal pain, accompanied by a high fever. 3 People experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment. It is usually necessary to seek emergency care.\n\nChildren are most likely to get appendicitis between the ages of 8 and 16. 4 Young children with acute appendicitis may have difficulty describing the symptoms they are experiencing, so it is important that parents are aware of the signs of appendicitis. The most common symptoms of acute appendicitis in children are: Abdominal pain and pain with movement Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Fever Young children cannot always easily explain the specific location or feeling of pain. Even if a child is experiencing localized pain on the right side of their abdomen, they might identify the pain as affecting their entire stomach. This could lead parents to think their child has a different condition. Children with appendicitis may also lie down and bend either the right hip or both hips upward as though drawing their knees to their chest. This position reduces the discomfort caused by an inflamed appendix. They may also be reluctant to breathe deeply, instead choosing to breathe shallowly into the chest to avoid moving the painful abdominal wall. In older children and teenagers, the most common symptoms are similar to those experienced by adults. Good to know: It is not uncommon for acute appendicitis in children to be confused with gastroenteritis , a common condition also known as stomach flu. A misdiagnosis can increase the risk of a burst appendix.\n\nIdentifying appendicitis in pregnant people can be difficult, as many of the symptoms are similar to the discomfort normally associated with the early stages of pregnancy , such as: Nausea Vomiting Cramping If persistent nausea, vomiting and cramping occur, the affected person should seek urgent medical advice. The uterus may also push the appendix into the upper abdomen by a few centimeters, particularly during the third trimester. In this case, pain from appendicitis may also occur in the upper right side of the abdomen, instead of just in the usual position in the lower right side. People in the later stages of pregnancy are difficult to diagnose with appendicitis because they tend to have unusual symptoms. These can include: 6 A sudden change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea) An increase in gas New or worsening heartburn Urinary symptoms such as frequent urination Pregnant people experiencing possible symptoms of acute appendicitis can carry out a free symptom assessment in the Ada app .",
    "acute_appendicitis_causes": "Appendicitis is generally caused by a blockage of the appendix, which increases the pressure inside the appendix and can cut off blood flow. Inside the blocked appendix, bacteria multiply and  pus accumulates, which further damages the wall of the appendix and causes pain and irritation. If the inflammation is not relieved, part of the wall of the appendix may die, and a hole may form. This is known as a perforation or rupture, and if this happens, urgent medical help is needed. The blockage is most often caused by fecaliths, small accumulations of hardened stool, but other causes of a blocked appendage include: 7 8 Infections caused by bacteria or, less commonly, viruses Hemolytic anemia Swollen lymph tissue in the area, more common among people with disorders that lead to inflammation in the bowel, such as diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease Tumors of the appendix, although these are rare Intestinal worms, although this is uncommon Foreign bodies, such as fruit seed residue, although this is very rare",
    "acute_appendicitis_vs_chronic_appendicitis": "The most common type of appendicitis is acute, in which an infection causes sharp pain that rapidly develops over a period of hours. However, in rare instances, appendicitis may develop slowly over a period of days or weeks. This is known as chronic, or recurrent, appendicitis. 9 The symptoms of chronic appendicitis tend to come and go and are usually less intense than those of acute appendicitis. The symptoms resemble those of acute appendicitis, but with pain that is usually dull and achy rather than sharp. Nausea and chills may accompany the pain. Chronic appendicitis occurs when the inside of the appendix is partially obstructed and becomes infected, but the pressure building inside the infected, inflamed appendix dislodges the obstruction instead of causing rupture or perforation. Symptoms then subside until the appendix becomes blocked again. As the symptoms of chronic appendicitis are similar to other chronic digestive issues, this condition is sometimes confused with: Ulcerative colitis (UC) Crohn’s disease Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Diverticulitis To diagnose chronic appendicitis, the following diagnostic techniques can be used: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Computed tomography (CT) scans Ultrasound Chronic appendicitis is treated by surgically removing the appendix . 9",
    "acute_appendicitis_diagnosis": "Acute appendicitis symptoms are similar to those of other conditions, such as: Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) Bladder infection Crohn’s disease Gallbladder issues Intestinal infection Diverticulitis Gastritis To make a clear diagnosis, doctors will typically use a range of tests. Pain in the abdomen can have a number of causes. In addition to this, the exact position of the appendix within the abdomen differs slightly from person to person. For these reasons, it can sometimes be hard for both affected people and doctors to diagnose acute appendicitis. Read more about other causes of abdominal pain that may be mistaken for appendicitis » . Doctors examining a person with suspected acute appendicitis will take a verbal history of their symptoms and examine the affected person’s abdomen. 10 Laboratory tests are sometimes used to help doctors confirm whether or not the affected person indeed has appendicitis, and can be used to help doctors decide if they should operate, but they cannot be used to confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis.\n\nTests used in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis include: 1 Physical examination of the abdomen Rectal exam Blood tests for signs of infection, such as a white blood cell count CT scan MRI scan Abdominal ultrasonography Urine test, to exclude a UTI as the cause",
    "acute_appendicitis_risks_and_complications": "The most serious risk is that acute appendicitis will cause the appendix to burst (perforate), causing infected material to collect and spread to other parts of the belly. The vast majority of cases of perforated appendix are successfully treated. If the infection spreads widely throughout the abdomen and is not treated urgently, it could result in death. Good to know: A burst appendix is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment and a hospital stay.\n\nIf the appendix becomes blocked, the fluid and mucus inside it cannot pass out. Instead they accumulate and increase the pressure inside the appendix. This leads to swelling and the bacteria inside the appendix to multiply. 11 This swelling constricts the appendix’s blood supply. If the blood supply does not come back and the swelling is not treated, cells in the appendix wall can die, causing a hole to open or the tissue to become porous. This is known as perforation or rupture of the appendix. 11 If this happens, bacteria can leak out of the appendix, and if any pus has accumulated, it too will leak out into the tissues surrounding the appendix. This can cause peritonitis. This process is typically very painful and is always a serious condition requiring emergency medical treatment. A perforated appendix can itself have several complications besides peritonitis, including abscesses, and gangrene. Good to know: People who have a perforated appendix may experience a worsening of symptoms over time. Appendiceal perforations can vary in severity, but this is something that can only be determined by tests carried out by trained medical staff. It is not possible to gauge the severity of a ruptured appendix at home, and professional medical attention is needed.\n\nPeritonitis is uncommon, but when it does occur, it is a medical emergency. Peritonitis is an infection of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity, usually the result of an infection spreading from an organ to the peritoneum. The regions in which pain is felt and how severe the pain is, change as the infection spreads. Generally, a perforated appendix will be painful, and as the infection spreads to the parts of the peritoneum nearest the appendix, the pain will also spread. If the infection then spreads to the entire peritoneum, the pain will then be felt as general belly pain and tenderness. Pain from peritonitis feels worse when the affected person bends their hips or coughs; it is also painful if pressure is applied. In cases related to appendicitis, pain will usually be most intense over the appendix, where the infection began. Other symptoms of peritonitis may include: 12 Fever, a body temperature of 38 degrees C / 100.4 degrees F or higher. Chills Diarrhea or reduced bowel movements (ileus) Low blood pressure Fast heartbeat Low output of urine Sepsis , in severe cases\n\nAppendiceal abscesses are the most common complication of a perforated appendix. An abscess is a collection of pus that forms in a tissue, space or organ in the body. People with appendiceal abscesses may experience abdominal pain and high fever, but because these are fairly common symptoms, a standard physical examination may not be enough to make the diagnosis. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan is often needed to show for certain that an abscess has formed. 13 If the abscess is small, the affected person will be given intravenous antibiotics to try to reduce the size. Surgery to remove the appendix will only be performed some weeks later, with the affected person being closely monitored in the meantime. 10 This is known as an interval appendectomy. If the abscess is larger or has many different pockets of pus, it will be drained, and intravenous antibiotics will be administered. In the case of a large abscess that improves after drainage and antibiotics, a drainage catheter will be left in until the abscess is cleared, and surgery to remove the appendix will take place a few weeks later. In the case of a large, multicompartmental abscess, surgical drainage should be done quickly, and the appendix may be removed at the same time if this is safe for the affected person. 8 Good to know: Although it seems counterintuitive not to perform surgery as soon as possible if a complication such as an abscess has formed, it is in fact sometimes safer to delay operating. This is due to the very high risk of complications that might occur if surgery is performed on a very ill patient or around an abscess that might contaminate the abdominal cavity if it bursts. If you are concerned about the timing of your or a loved one’s surgery, speak to the surgeon and/or the care team involved.\n\nThis rare complication occurs when a perforated appendix becomes gangrenous, which means that the tissue dies and begins to decompose. In such cases, sepsis and peritonitis may occur, and the affected person’s symptoms are usually severe. This disorder is a medical emergency.\n\nIn some cases, a very severely inflamed appendix may push the small intestine into a position where it becomes kinked. This blocks the passage of food through the intestines. People with an intestinal obstruction may have bright yellow or green vomit, and an X-ray or CT scan is needed for a conclusive diagnosis. 11",
    "acute_appendicitis_treatment": "An appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix), also known as an appendicectomy outside the US, is the chosen treatment method for acute appendicitis in almost all cases. This is because the risk of an infected appendix rupturing and causing a potentially dangerous infection is extremely high. 1 Recent evidence has suggested that some cases of uncomplicated appendicitis can be treated with antibiotics instead of an appendectomy. However, this is only appropriate when the appendix has not burst or caused an abscess, and studies have not yet shown that antibiotic-only treatment is as effective as an appendectomy, which remains the standard treatment for appendicitis. 10 11 14 Generally, someone who is known or strongly suspected to have acute appendicitis will be admitted to hospital. They will not be allowed to eat or drink, but will be given intravenous fluids and painkillers, and scheduled for surgery. Surgery generally takes place as soon as possible in order to prevent the infection spreading or complications occurring. In many cases, doctors will also administer antibiotics through a drip both before and after surgery.\n\nSurgery is the standard treatment for appendicitis regardless of whether or not complications have occurred. Procedures to remove the appendix, known as appendectomies, can be done using traditional open surgery or using less invasive laparoscopic techniques . Laparoscopic surgery and open appendectomy take about the same amount of time. Surgery for a perforated or infected appendix may take longer than surgery for a minimally-affected appendix. Complications are rare in surgery for acute appendicitis. Laparoscopic surgery has a lower chance of complications, though, as in all surgery, complications may occur. 11\n\nAfter surgery, people should avoid strenuous activity or heavy lifting for some weeks, and take special care to ensure that their wounds are kept clean and dry. Normal diet can usually be resumed fairly soon after surgery, often even before the affected person is discharged from hospital. However the recovery advice given may vary based on individual and surgical factors, so it is important to always follow the instructions given by one’s medical team. 11 Often, additional medications to treat pain or restore normal bowel movements are prescribed by the attending physician.",
    "acute_appendicitis_faqs": "Q: How can I tell if it’s appendicitis or something less serious? A: In some ways, the abdominal pain and nausea from appendicitis can feel similar to the discomfort caused by gas, constipation, indigestion or stomach flu . However, the pain caused by appendicitis is usually localized to the lower right side of the abdomen, far more severe and tends to increase in intensity. Pressing on the abdominal area will increase the pain from acute appendicitis, as will passing gas or belching. Acute appendicitis also usually occurs with a high fever. 15 As acute appendicitis can progress from the first signs to rupture in 24-72 hours, it is important to visit a hospital as soon as acute appendicitis is suspected. Signs may include fever or digestive upset, combined with abdominal pain on the right side of the abdomen that becomes more intense instead of abating. Sometimes the symptoms of appendicitis do not follow a predictable pattern, though, so a person experiencing unusual abdominal pain that lasts for longer than four hours should seek a diagnosis from a doctor urgently, especially if any other symptoms are also present. Q: Is there always a fever with appendicitis? A: Acute appendicitis sometimes occurs without a fever. Q: How can appendicitis be prevented? A: There is no known way to prevent appendicitis, but it does seem to occur less commonly among people who eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and fiber. 8 Q: Are there any risks associated with an appendectomy (appendicectomy)? A: An appendectomy – the surgical procedure to remove the appendix – is generally considered routine. However, though the risk is low,  there are certain risks associated with an appendectomy, just as there are with any surgical procedure. These risks include: Excessive bleeding Infection The formation of an abscess Abdominal inflammation Before undergoing an appendectomy, be sure to discuss the possible complications with your doctor. 1 Read more about acute appendicitis treatment » Q: What happens if my appendix bursts? A: As soon as the warning signs of appendicitis appear (abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, etc) it is important to seek emergency medical attention to ensure the appropriate treatment is received. If this does not happen and the appendix bursts, potentially life threatening infections can result. If bacteria from a burst appendix reaches the peritoneum (the inner lining of the belly), this can result in an infection known as peritonitis. Signs of peritonitis include: severe continuous abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, vomiting and fever. Another possible consequence of a burst appendix is the formation of an abscess. Both peritonitis and an abscess can be treated with antibiotics (most likely administered intravenously) but require urgent medical attention. Read more about acute appendicitis complications »"

    "condition": "Acute Aspiration of Oropharyngeal or Gastric Contents",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-aspiration-of-e-or-gastric-contents/",
    "what_is_acute_aspiration": "Aspiration is a condition where fluids or solid particles (especially food) go into the windpipe or lungs (are inhaled or aspirated), instead of being swallowed into the esophagus and stomach. This can cause blockage of the airways and inflammation and infection of the lungs. It is more likely if there is a problem with the normal swallowing or gag reflexes. Symptoms may include coughing while eating, wheezing and shortness of breath. Toddlers and the elderly tend to aspirate more commonly, as do people who have had a stroke or brain injury, or who have other neurologic conditions. The outcome after aspirating depends on the substance aspirated, the age of the person affected and the presence of complications following the aspiration.",
    "risks": "This condition tends to be more common among toddlers and the elderly. Certain medical conditions, especially those which affect the ability to swallow or the gag reflex significantly increase the risk of aspiration. These include problems with the development of the airways before birth, drowsiness, sedating drugs (including anesthetics and alcohol), and after a stroke or other brain injury, among other causes.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms may include a cough with eating, choking, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing, extreme tiredness, fever, and a blue tinge to the lips, fingers and feet.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on the symptoms, a physical examination and a chest X-ray or CT scan. Other tests that may be useful include tests of swallowing function and testing the airway mucus for bacteria.",
    "treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity of the aspiration. The aspirated objects or objects may need to removed by using a flexible camera to look at the windpipes. If pneumonia occurs, antibiotics might be given. In severe cases, the aspiration may cause severe damage to the lungs, and a machine to help with breathing (a ventilator) might be necessary to support breathing while the lungs recover.",
    "prevention": "Most people can prevent it by having a strong cough. Physiotherapy can help to develop and maintain the coughing muscles. People with difficulty swallowing should get and follow advice from a speech pathologist on foods that are safe to eat to prevent aspiration. Avoiding some behaviors, such as excessive drinking and talking when eating, may help avoid some episodes of aspiration."

    "condition": "Acute Bronchitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-bronchitis/",
    "what_is_acute_bronchitis": "Acute bronchitis – also commonly called a chest cold – is a short-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes which carry air to and from the lungs. Its principal symptom is coughing. This is often accompanied by: 1 2 Wheezing Shortness of breath Fatigue Coughing up mucus (phlegm) or sputum (a mixture of saliva and phlegm) A common condition, it often develops following upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold or the flu . It is usually caused by viruses, but in rare cases, it can be caused by a bacterial infection. It is generally considered to be non-serious and in most cases will clear up in around two weeks, though the characteristic cough may linger for longer. However, there is a risk that the causal infection will spread further into the lungs and develop into pneumonia – a more serious condition.",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptom of acute bronchitis is a cough , which is typically described as dry and hacking in nature in its initial stages. As the condition develops and phlegm builds up in the lungs, coughing up phlegm or sputum will likely occur. This may be yellow, green or clear in color. Other signs and symptoms of acute bronchitis may include: 1 3 Sore throat Fever Chest congestion Shortness of breath Wheezing Chills Fatigue Unexplained weight loss The duration of the main condition is usually between 10 and 14 days. However, the cough alone often lasts longer, around two to three weeks or possibly more. The exact reason for this is not fully understood, but may be due to ongoing healing processes in airways. Good to know: Coughing up a small amount blood, or having bloody sputum, is a possible symptom of bronchitis , as it can result from prolonged coughing causing tiny tears in the throat lining. However, if a person coughs up blood or has bloody sputum, this is more likely to be a sign of a more serious chest infection, such as pneumonia. Always seek a medical opinion if blood is present, so that the cause can be identified and treated. A differential diagnosis can be made with the aid of various tests, including a chest X-ray. 2 Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .\n\nThe condition may be misdiagnosed as, or can develop into, pneumonia ‒ an infection of the lungs. The two conditions share many of the same symptoms, including having a productive cough, i.e. a cough which produces green or yellow sputum, chest pain and a fever. Signs that acute bronchitis may actually be ‒ or may have developed into ‒ pneumonia include: 4 A very high fever; of 38 C or above Sharp chest pain Coughing up blood or bloody sputum Persistent chills Shoulder and neck pain Symptoms generally worsening Read more about pneumonia » and pneumonia in children » Seek medical attention promptly if pneumonia is suspected . Tests, including a chest X-ray and sputum analysis, will usually be carried out to confirm the diagnosis, so that the correct treatment approach can be devised.\n\nIf the condition is recurring, it may be diagnosed as chronic bronchitis, a constant irritation of the bronchial tubes in the lungs. 1 This form of bronchitis is often associated with smoking, but can also be made more likely by exposure to irritants in the air, such as pollution, fumes or vapours from industrial cleaning products. For bronchitis to be diagnosed as chronic, it must persist for a duration of at least three months of the year, for two years in a row. 1 For more information, see this resource on chronic bronchitis .",
    "causes": "The condition is most commonly caused by a viral infection – often involving the same viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold and flu. When a person acquires such a virus, the mucous membrane lining of the airways can be affected, and when that happens the symptoms of acute bronchitis can result. Processes which take place as a result of the infection include: 5 6 Hyperemia; increased blood flow to the mucus membrane, resulting in inflammation of the airways which conduct air to the lungs Edema; otherwise known as fluid buildup, which also contributes to inflammation of the airways Increased phlegm production; which occurs in the airways, as a result of the swelling and inflammation caused by the infection These changes to normal bronchial tube function result in a buildup of phlegm in the airways, causing coughing and other symptoms.\n\nAcute bronchitis can be contracted through exposure to droplets released after an infected person coughs or sneezes. Viruses spread in these droplets are able to survive on a surface for as long as 24 hours. 1 It can also be caused by bacterial infections, but this is far less common.",
    "risk_factors": "Certain factors make developing the condition more likely. These include: 7 Smoking tobacco products Environmental factors, such as exposure to inner-city pollution or irritant chemicals, for example chemical cleaning compounds Having a compromised immune system, which reduces the body’s ability to fight off causal infections; this can be due to a short-term condition such as the common cold , or a chronic condition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Recurrent irritation to the throat, experienced as a result of stomach acid reflux from gastroesophageal reflux disease Good to know: These factors can also cause chronic bronchitis , depending on the length of a person’s exposure to them.",
    "diagnosis": "In its early stages, it may be difficult to distinguish the condition from a common cold. However, in the majority of cases, a doctor will be able to diagnose a person accurately after performing a physical examination and inquiring about what symptoms are being experienced. If there are difficulties making the diagnosis, or if the condition persists for a longer period than expected, a series of further tests may be called for. These tests may include: 8 Pulmonary function test; a group of tests that measure how well the lungs work, used to check for signs of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Sputum tests; sputum, or mucus, can be tested to identify underlying causes Chest X-ray; an X-ray may be useful in determining the cause of a cough and ruling out the possibility of pneumonia, or other lung problems Good to know: If a person is affected by pneumonia, the alveoli (air sacs) which pass oxygen to the blood become filled with fluid. This will show up as a white area on a chest X-ray. 9",
    "treatment": "In many cases, the condition will require no treatment and will clear up of its own accord in two to three weeks. If it is particularly severe, if it lasts for longer than 10 to 14 days, or if a bacterial cause is suspected, however, treatment methods are available. These include: Cough medicine; if a cough is particularly severe and affects sleep, a cough medicine may be prescribed by a doctor, or they may recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) form of cough medicine. However there is little evidence that cough medicines are effective. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be taken to suppress fever, aches and pains associated with the condition. Antibiotic medications; these may be prescribed, if sputum tests reveal that the causal infection is bacterial ; however, these will not be effective against viral infections or cases where the condition is due to non-infectious causes. Other medications; people with allergies, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be prescribed a range of other medications to help alleviate the symptoms of the condition.\n\nTo manage the symptoms of acute bronchitis at home, it may also be helpful to: 1 Rest; this is vital in order to help the immune system regain its strength. Hydrate; drinking plenty of water prevents dehydration, and may help to thin out the sputum in the chest, making it easier to cough up. Consume hot drinks and throat lozenges; some people find that drinks such as tea with honey and over-the-counter lozenges can provide some relief from symptoms including coughing and sore throat. Inhale steam; steam from a hot shower or through a towel over a bowl of hot water may help dislodge sputum and relieve symptoms. Good to know: To avoid burns and scalds, make sure that children are supervised all the time when inhaling steam, and do not come into contact with any water which is hotter than they would normally bathe in.\n\nSome people find certain herbal remedies helpful; however, there is currently no strong medical evidence supporting their use. These include: 10 11 13 Apple cider vinegar (ACV), some people believe this can help thin mucus and reduce congestion. ACV is best taken by drinking a solution with warm water. Turmeric, a plant and spice which contains the compound curcumin, which may have antiviral and antibacterial properties. Ginger, which may have anti-inflammatory properties, and can be eaten raw, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements. Essential oils, which can be added to hot compresses or bath water. Popular oils to use for acute bronchitis are frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon. Never ingest an essential oil. Good to know: Some herbal remedies and supplements cannot be taken with underlying conditions or certain prescription medications. If, in addition to their chest cold, a person has a chronic (ongoing) condition and/or regularly takes any medications, they should consult their doctor before using any natural products.",
    "prevention": "Although it is not always possible to completely avoid the viruses and bacteria that cause acute bronchitis, there are several ways to reduce the risk of contracting acute bronchitis. These include: Washing hands as frequently and thoroughly as possible, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer Getting plenty of rest Avoiding excessively touching the eyes or mouth, particularly around people who have a respiratory infection Avoiding sharing items such as drinking glasses or utensils, or towels Making efforts to keep healthy with regular exercise and a balanced diet Getting vaccinated against pneumonia, flu and whooping cough",
    "acute_bronchitis_in_children": "Acute bronchitis can develop in children of any age. Premature babies and children with asthma or allergies are especially susceptible. The symptoms of acute bronchitis in children, as well as the treatment methods, are generally the same as in adult cases. However, complications may present differently in children. Parents should seek immediate medical attention if any of the following symptoms occur: Breathing becomes difficult and wheezing occurs A child struggles to talk or eat A child experiences a fever of 38 degrees or higher, neck stiffness or headaches The lips or nails turn grey or blue A child is dizzy, confused, faints or finds waking up more difficult than usual Signs of dehydration, such as cracked lips, crying without tears or a dry mouth occur A fever disappears and then returns A child’s cough lasts for longer than three weeks Symptoms generally worsen Breathing difficulties are especially likely to be apparent in younger children. There may be signs that the child is having trouble breathing, including flaring of the nostrils and clenching of the muscles in the ribs. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may be developing acute bronchitis, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .",
    "acute_bronchitis_faqs": "Q: Is acute bronchitis contagious? A: Yes. It is, in most cases, caused by influenza or other similar virus types. These viruses can be spread from person to person via droplets expelled when an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks. To avoid developing acute bronchitis, people should try to wash their hands regularly, avoid close contact with people with an infection and get an annual flu shot. Q: Are there any home remedies for acute bronchitis? A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies that may help to alleviate the symptoms of bronchitis. For more information, see Treatment: : Home remedies for bronchitis . Q: Can antibiotics be used to treat acute bronchitis? A: Most cases of bronchitis are the result of a viral infection, and therefore antibiotics will be unhelpful. In persistent or severe cases of bronchitis, a bacterial infection may be suspected, in which case antibiotics could be prescribed after confirming the diagnosis. Unnecessary use of antibiotics can be harmful and lead to antibiotic resistance, so antibiotics should only be prescribed when necessary. Q: What is the difference between acute bronchitis and a chest cold? A: There is no difference – they are different terms for the same condition . Acute bronchitis is, however, different to a common cold and is characterized by more severe symptoms and the buildup of sputum. Q: Can acute bronchitis turn into pneumonia? A: Yes, approximately one in 20 cases of bronchitis will develop into pneumonia, according to the U.K.’s National Health Service. 1 This is the most common complication of bronchitis, and results from the causal infection advancing further into the lungs. Pneumonia can be diagnosed using various tests, including a chest X-ray. Q: Can acute bronchitis be a symptom of cancer? A: If a person experiences recurrent chest infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia, this may indicate the presence of a serious underlying cause, such as lung cancer. 14 If cancer is suspected, diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray, biopsy and CT scan will be carried out. 15 Q: What is acute bronchitis with bronchospasm? A: A bronchospasm occurs when the airways (bronchi) temporarily narrow, reducing the airflow to the lungs. This limits the amount of air coming in and out of the lungs, resulting in symptoms such as wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath. Medications can be prescribed to help widen the airways. Bronchospasm is more likely to be a complication of chronic, rather than acute, bronchitis.

    "condition": "Acute Gastritis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-gastritis/",
    "what_is_acute_gastritis": "Acute gastritis is an inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining. The condition tends to last for a short period of time only. If the inflammation persists, however, the condition is referred to as chronic gastritis. Acute gastritis can affect people of all ages, though it’s more common in adulthood and old age. It can have a number of different causes, ranging from bacterial Helicobacter pylori infection to certain medications, and many more. The typical symptoms may include stomach pain or discomfort, as well as loss of appetite, nausea or even vomiting. Diagnosis is usually suspected based on a person’s medical history and physical examination. Afterwards it’s confirmed by taking a biopsy sample from the stomach lining. This is essential for making the correct diagnosis. Therefore, treatment depends on the underlying cause revealed in the biopsy results. Both prevention and prognosis of the condition depend on the underlying cause. For example, in people taking pain relievers called NSAIDs, or excessively consuming alcohol causing gastritis, avoiding these substances is necessary. If the condition is not treated accordingly, it can become chronic resulting in several complications. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , , 7 , 8 ,",
    "what_causes_acute_gastritis": "Generally, anything that damages the stomach lining cells can lead to acute gastritis. If the mucosa is damaged but there is no or very little inflammation, the condition is referred to as gastropathy. There are many different causes for acute gastritis: Bacterial Helicobacter pylori infection, taking certain pain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, as well as alcohol and smoking are among the most common ones. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , Causes of acute gastritis include:\n\n1. Helicobacter pylori This is one of the most common causes of acute and chronic gastritis. The bacteria can be found in around two-thirds of the world’s population. 2. Other pathogens These are far less common. can include other types of bacteria, as well as viruses, parasites, and fungi.\n\n1. Bile reflux Bile is naturally discharged into the small intestines to help digestion. If bile accidentally makes its way up to the stomach it can damage the mucosa. 2. Alcohol Alcohol, particularly liquor and high-proof alcohol, is considered to have a damaging effect on the stomach mucosa. Regular, as well as excessive intake may lead to gastropathy. 3. NSAIDs The group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is one of the most common causes. Pain medication, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can result in an increase in acidity because they inhibit protective substances called prostaglandins. Regular, as well as high-dose intake can lead to gastropathy. This is even more likely if glucocorticoids, a medication decreasing the body’s immune response, are taken simultaneously. 4. Iron supplements The potentially damaging effect on the mucosa is bigger if taken on an empty stomach. Also, this side effect is dependent on the dose. 5. Smoking Smoking is considered to be a risk factor for gastropathy. 6. Some types of chemotherapy medications\n\nThis is a malfunction of the immune system that leads to an autoimmune reaction which can affect the stomach lining cells.\n\nRare malformations of blood vessels, as well as complications of chronic heart failure can affect the blood flow to the stomach wall causing gastropathy.\n\nIf the stomach’s oxygen supply is insufficient due to changes in blood circulation, this can result in gastropathy.This can result from: cocaine intake. having too little blood volume due to severe dehydration or other causes. sepsis . severe burns . severe trauma.\n\nSome food allergies trigger inflammation in the stomach. The reaction causes high level of white blood cells. The cells in this circumstance are called eosinophiles. Poisons on the other hand, can be irritative. The irritation damages the stomach. This produces gastritis as well.\n\nThis is a specific group of conditions that affect the body’s immune system. People with Crohn’s disease or sarcoidosis can develop gastritis as a complication.\n\nIn some conditions the exact underlying mechanism is still mostly unknown.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The typical symptoms of gastritis may include stomach pain or discomfort, as well as loss of appetite, nausea or even vomiting. In some cases, however, there may only be mild symptoms, or even no symptoms at all. Food intake can sometimes reduce or increase the abdominal discomfort . 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 ,\n\n1. Stomach pain or discomfort This can be absent or range from mild to severe. Pain can be aching, burning, or gnawing. 2. Heartburn 3. Loss of appetite 4. Nausea and vomiting 5. Vomiting of blood This may occur if the gastritis leads to tears or deep sores of the stomach lining. If this is the case, the condition is referred to as erosive gastritis. Bleeding can occur several days after the onset of acute gastritis. 6. Weight loss This usually takes more time and is therefore more common in chronic gastritis. 7. Fever This may occur in rare cases indicating serious infection caused by pathogens other than H. pylori. 8. An unusual feeling of fullness in the stomach area 9. Feeling full too quickly after eating The condition tends to last for a short period of time only. If the inflammation persists, however, the condition is referred to as chronic gastritis. 3 , 7 , 8 , If you think you might have acute gastritis, try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "how_is_acute_gastritis_diagnosed": "Diagnosis of acute gastritis is usually suspected based on a person’s medical history and physical examination. Afterwards it’s confirmed by taking a biopsy sample from the stomach lining. This is essential for making the correct diagnosis. 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , The approach to diagnosis includes:\n\nThis includes questions about: medication use, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, glucocorticoids, chemotherapy medications, bisphosphonates, proton pump inhibitors, iron supplements, antibiotics, and antacids. smoking and drinking habits. underlying conditions, such as Crohn’s disease or celiac disease .\n\nOften, there are no or only mild findings, such as a slight stomach tenderness. However, signs of other conditions, as well as possible complications can be detected this way.\n\nAn endoscope is a long tube with a camera at its end. By inserting the endoscope through the affected person’s mouth and oesophagus into the stomach, doctors can examine the gastric mucosa at close range and take tissue samples. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract (GI) is essential to confirm the diagnosis of gastritis. As a rule, several tissue samples are taken at the same time. In many cases, an examination of the gastric mucosa with an endoscope can provide the correct information about the underlying cause of gastritis. However, an analysis of the tissue samples is necessary.\n\nBy retrieving tissue samples (biopsy), precise statements can be made about the localization of gastritis in the stomach, the severity, and possible degeneration of individual cells. Performing a biopsy is also the standard method to determine whether the H. pylori bacterium is the underlying cause of gastritis.\n\n1. Testing for H. pylori can be achieved by: analyzing the biopsy sample (see above). carrying out a so-called urea breath test. This test identifies H. pylori by analyzing the air affected people exhale after drinking a certain diagnostic fluid. so-called stool antigen testing. This test identifies H. pylori in a stool sample. 2. Immunologic markers If autoimmune gastritis is suspected, specific markers, such as antibodies, should be analyzed.",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_acute_gastritis": "Treatment for acute gastritis depends on the underlying cause. Making the correct diagnosis and treating the condition accordingly is essential in order to avoid the gastritis becoming chronic. Different treatment options include: 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , , 10 , 11\n\nIf the disease is caused by the repeated, as well as excessive use of a certain substance, it is crucial for the affected person to stop taking these substances. This applies to: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Other medications, such as glucocorticoids, chemotherapy medications, bisphosphonates, and iron supplements. smoking. alcohol. In all of these it is important to consult a doctor who can: help find a good alternative to current medication. can advise on taking the right measures for alcohol or smoking withdrawal symptoms. provide the necessary support, e.g. through support groups for alcohol or smoking addiction.\n\n1. Antibiotic medication H. pylori is a bacterium that can only be eliminated by the use of antibiotics. Once the bacterium has been successfully eliminated as a cause, gastritis usually disappears as well. 2. proton pump inhibitor (PPI) a drug that reduces the amount of acid produced by the stomach 3. triple therapy A combination of three drugs is initially used to treat H. pylori infection. This treatment includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two different antibiotics. This is necessary to prevent bacteria from developing resistance to a single antibiotic. The duration of treatment is between 10 and 14 days. After completing H. pylori treatment, the success of the treatment must be confirmed. This takes place at least four weeks after the beginning of the treatment. The eradication of the bacterium can be assessed with non-invasive methods such as the urea breath test or a stool antigen test. In most cases, triple therapy will successfully eliminate the infection. If additional treatment is required, doctors usually recommend quad therapy. This involves one PPI and three different antibiotics.\n\nNutrition Nutrition does not play a crucial role in the development of gastritis, although it may be advisable to avoid eating hearty, spicy, or acidic foods that irritate the stomach in order to alleviate symptoms. Eating smaller, more frequent meals (instead of larger, heavier meals), weight reduction for those overweight, and stress management can complement but cannot replace treatment. Other measures: 1. Stress management can complement but cannot replace treatment. 2. Weight reduction for those overweight can complement but cannot replace treatment. 3. Medication that is freely available in pharmacies such as antacids can alleviate stomach and digestive problems but will not solve the underlying problem and should not be taken as a long-term solution. If the symptoms persist for more than a week or if symptoms are severe, a doctor should be consulted.",
    "can_acute_gastritis_be_prevented": "Effective prevention of acute gastritis is only possible in those cases in which substance use is the underlying cause. This includes substances like: 4 , 7 , 8 , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen. other medications, such as glucocorticoids, chemotherapy medications, bisphosphonates, and iron supplements. smoking. alcohol. In all of these it is important to consult a doctor who can: 4 , 7 , 8 , help find a good alternative to current medication. can advice on taking the right measures for alcohol or smoking withdrawal symptoms. provide the necessary support, e.g. through support groups for alcohol or smoking addiction.",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_acute_gastritis": "The prognosis of acute gastritis is directly dependent on the underlying cause and if the condition is treated accordingly. Other factors to consider include: 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , The course of the disease can also vary greatly from person to person. Gastritis caused by the H. pylori bacterium can exist in some people without any symptoms, while others suffer from severe and sometimes increasing symptoms. In addition, the prognosis also depends on whether complications develop as a result of inflammation, such as chronic gastritis, stomach ulcers or stomach cancer .",
    "what_are_the_complications": "Acute gastritis can lead to complications if the condition becomes chronic. This topic is dealt with in the article about chronic gastritis. 3 If you think you might have acute gastritis, try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "acute_gastritis_faqs": "Q. How long does acute gastritis last? A: The duration of an attack of acute gastritis depends on: identifying the underlying cause of the condition. how soon specific treatment for the condition is started. If both of the above are fulfilled, in most people symptoms get better within days or a few weeks. If adequate treatment is not implemented, the condition can become chronic. 7 , 8 Q: Is acute gastritis contagious? A: Acute gastritis can have a number of different causes (see above) which range from infectious to noninfectious. All the noninfectious causes therefore cannot be contagious. The most common infectious cause is gastritis due to a H. pylori infection. Its ways of transmission include: drinking contaminated water in developing countries. (This may include swimming in rivers, streams, pools, as well as drinking stream water, or eating uncooked vegetables.) having family members who are infected. (Sharing the same living environment with someone infected has been proven to increase the risk of infection.) Good to know: Receiving the infection by coming in contact with someone’s saliva - through kissing or sharing the same bottle - has not been proven to be a way of transmission yet."

    "condition": "Acute Heart Failure",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-heart-failure/",
    "what_is_acute_heart_failure": "Heart failure is a state of reduced cardiac output, in which the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively. When symptoms appear suddenly, or a person experiences rapid worsening of existing symptoms of heart failure, this is called acute heart failure (AHF) or acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This condition can be life threatening and should be urgently evaluated by a doctor, as outcomes can be affected by whether a person gets early and appropriate treatment. 1 Heart failure is a common condition which mostly affects people aged 65 or older. Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalizations in the elderly, with around 1 million admissions per year in the United States. 2 Typical symptoms of acute heart failure include: Shortness of breath Tiredness Swelling of the feet and legs Treatment typically involves supporting breathing and adjusting the blood pressure and, where necessary, removing excess fluid from the body. There is no cure, but long-term treatment involving medications and rehabilitation can improve the heart’s function.\n\nAcute heart failure has a sudden onset and symptoms can appear without warning. In chronic heart failure, that difficulty is ongoing and long-term. More people develop chronic heart failure than acute heart failure, and around 80 percent of acute heart failure cases are people with chronic heart failure whose symptoms rapidly become worse. 3 4 Read more about Chronic Heart Failure »",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of acute heart failure can appear very quickly. It can be indicated by the appearance of new symptoms, or by an existing heart condition suddenly becoming worse. General symptoms of acute heart failure include: 5 6 7 Shortness of breath while moving or lying flat, also known as dyspnea Feeling tired A cough that may be worse at night or when lying down Swelling of feet, ankles, legs, abdomen or veins in the neck Cool peripheries, such as hands and feet, due to reduced cardiac output Veins in the neck protruding Swelling, also known as edema, is caused by fluid building up in different parts of the body because the heart is no longer able to pump efficiently. This is known as congestive heart failure. Depending on the location in the body of the fluid buildup or congestion, this can cause other symptoms. For example: 7 Congestion in the kidneys can mean less urine being produced during the day, which leads to frequent urination during the night Congestion in the bowel can lead to nausea and vomiting Medical attention should be sought immediately if any symptoms of acute heart failure develop. Additionally, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nNot everyone will experience the following symptoms of acute heart failure. Some of these symptoms are caused by an underlying condition. Less common symptoms of acute heart failure include: Palpitations, the feeling that the heart has skipped or added a beat, where the person has arrhythmia Fever, which can be caused by underlying infection Fainting, also called syncope Blue/colored lips, skin or tongue, also called central cyanosis\n\nAcute heart failure can cause other conditions, often as a consequence of fluid building up in different parts of the body.\n\nIf fluid builds up in the lungs, this causes a very serious condition called pulmonary edema. Fluid is pushed into air sacs which reduces the lungs’ ability to transfer oxygen into the blood. This leads to shortness of breath, particularly when lying down. Other symptoms can include: 8 9 Coughing or, in some cases, coughing up blood Wheezing Sluggishness Anxiety Swelling in the legs or abdomen Pulmonary edema can be life-threatening. Anyone showing signs of pulmonary edema should see a doctor immediately.\n\nAcute heart failure can cause a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity. This is called ascites and can cause pain in the abdomen, bloating and shortness of breath. 10\n\nAround one in four people who have acute heart failure also experience a significant worsening of kidney function, known as cardiorenal syndrome. The older a person is, the higher their risk of developing cardiorenal syndrome. The risk is increased if the person also has: 7 11 Hypertension Diabetes A history of heart and/or renal failure Atherosclerosis\n\nAcute heart failure can lead to a worsening of liver function. Liver cells can be destroyed through pressure building up due to blood slowing down before entering the heart, which is a very serious condition. It can cause: Jaundice, which is when skin and whites of eyes look yellow, urine becomes darker and stools become paler Nausea Vomiting Abdominal pain Another potential complication is cholestasis, where bile flow reduces or stops. This can cause jaundice, itchy skin, dark urine and bad smelling stools. 7 12 13 14",
    "causes": "The heart weakens with age, which particularly affects its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. This makes people over the age of 65 more susceptible to factors that can cause AHF, such as a different heart condition or existing symptoms of heart failure . There are various factors that can cause acute heart failure. Other heart conditions can lead to acute heart failure, such as: 5 15 16 17 18 19 Cardiomyopathy, the general name for a range of diseases which cause the heart muscle to become enlarged, thick or stiff Blood clots, which can lead to myocardial ischemia, which is where blood clots can partially or completely block the flow of blood to the heart, leading to coronary artery disease Myocarditis , which is inflammation of the heart muscle Endocarditis , which is a rare infection of inner lining of the heart and heart valves Disease of the heart valves, or defects which can be present from birth Arrhythmia in the lower chambers of the heart (ventricular arrhythmia) or in the upper chambers (supraventricular arrhythmia) Hypertension is another cause of plaque buildup inside veins and can weaken the heart. Other factors that can damage the heart and increase the risk of acute heart failure include: 3 5 20 Abuse of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, particularly cocaine HIV /AIDS Thyroid disorders Radiotherapy and chemotherapy during treatment for cancer Too much iron in the body",
    "diagnosis": "Acute heart failure, as well as some of its complications such as pulmonary edema, is a very serious condition. Medical attention should be sought immediately if AHF is suspected. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, patient history and physical examination for signs that the heart is failing to pump enough blood. Diagnostic tests can identify what type of heart failure is involved and which ventricle or side of the heart is involved, as treatments can differ. Tests that may be ordered include: 6 7 21 22 Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which uses electrodes to monitor electrical activity in the heart Blood oxygen levels should also be monitored Various blood tests can show underlying causes for heart failure or reveal effects of complications Chest X-ray, which can be useful to monitor response to treatment Echocardiogram (an ECHO scan, or a heart ultrasound), which builds a picture of the heart as it pumps blood and can help identify the type of failure MRI or computerised tomography (CT) scans can show damage to heart muscle Nuclear ventriculography, which uses radioactive materials injected into the bloodstream to form an image of the heart moving Types of heart failure which may occur in combination can be diagnosed by scanning, and testing the capabilities of the heart include: 5 23 Systolic failure: Also known as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), this is when the left ventricle stops contracting normally and cannot circulate blood around the body properly. Diastolic failure: Also known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), this is when the left ventricle stops relaxing properly and so cannot fill with enough blood during a heartbeat.",
    "treatment": "Acute heart failure can be life-threatening and anyone with symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible. Treatment is initially focused on alleviating life-threatening symptoms, then on the investigation of underlying causes and treatment of residual symptoms. Hospitalization is generally required while cardiac performance improves. 4 There are a range of potential treatments for acute heart failure. The treatment that is applied will depend on the person’s symptoms and the underlying issue causing them. For example: Shortness of breath (dyspnea): This symptom is treated with supplemental oxygen. The severity of dyspnea will dictate whether oxygen is supplied through a tube in the nose or a face mask. Sitting upright can help with breathing. 4 24 Buildup of fluid: Intravenous diuretics are used to treat buildup of fluid within the body. A pulmonary edema will also be treated with diuretics, as well as oxygen and heart failure medication. 9 25\n\nMost patients with acute heart failure have worsening symptoms of chronic heart failure. As soon as the acute episode is stabilized, there are various types of medication which can be prescribed. Most of them are vasodilators, which widen the blood vessels to help lower blood pressure: 5 26 27 28 29 30 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart Hydralazine, isosorbide and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), all of which work by relaxing blood vessels to lower blood pressure Aldosterone antagonists, which reduce the body’s sodium levels to lower blood pressure Beta blockers, which lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate Digoxin, which makes the heart beat more strongly Nitrates, which are usually given as a vasodilator when the person also has pulmonary edema Painkillers, such as morphine, may be useful to reduce anxiety in people who are restless and distressed Once the initial symptoms of acute heart failure have been brought under control, the condition needs to be managed to avoid further episodes. Drugs such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are commonly prescribed. 6 People with severe heart failure may need cardiology surgery. This will often involve implanting a device to regulate the heartbeat, a cardiac pacemaker. 5 Anyone who has experienced acute heart failure should take steps to lead a healthy lifestyle, which will reduce pressure on the heart. This includes eating a healthy diet and taking exercise. (See Preventing acute heart failure.)",
    "preventing_acute_heart_failure": "Acute heart failure may be prevented by taking steps to maintain a healthy heart. This means following a healthy lifestyle: 31\n\nThis includes: Fruits and vegetables Whole grains, such as whole grain bread or brown rice Reduced meat consumption Low fat or fat-free dairy products Beans, nuts and seeds Limiting foods high in saturated and trans fats, such as full fat cheese and processed food Avoiding foods that are high in salt/sodium or with added sugars Good to know: Everyone who adapts their diet should consult their doctor to ensure that their food plan is right for them, as this differs between people, depending on any food sensitivities they may have and their general overall health.\n\nKeep hydrated: Opt for water or non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages with no added sugar. For people who wish to drink alcohol, it is recommended that men consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women consume no more than one alcoholic drink per day. Avoid using tobacco products: Doctors can provide advice on targeted services for those seeking to quit or cut down. Avoid using illegal drugs Get at least a moderate amount of exercise, such as two hours and 30 minutes of brisk walking per week Maintain an appropriate weight, aiming for a body mass index (BMI) of 20-25 Manage stress levels, such as taking up meditation or exercise, or joining a therapy group Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a risk factor for developing acute and chronic heart failure . To learn more about how to prevent or manage high blood pressure, see the resource on Hypertension . Diabetes and coronary heart disease, a condition where a substance called plaque builds up in the artery walls , are also risk factors for acute heart failure. People with these conditions should speak with their doctor about treatment options. 5 Chronic heart failure can lead to acute heart failure. People with chronic heart failure should learn how to recognize the early signs of worsening heart failure.",

    "condition": "Acute HIV Infection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-hiv-infection/",
    "what_is_acute_hiv": "An acute HIV infection is the first stage of an infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus . This stage refers to the period after the actual moment of infection. It could take 2 to 4 weeks from the moment of infection for someone to develop an acute HIV infection. During the acute stage , the human immunodeficiency virus multiplies rapidly and spreads throughout the body. As this stage is characterized by the rapid multiplication of HIV, there will be a high presence of the virus in the body and the risk of transmission to other people will be high. This acute stage can go by unnoticed, as the symptoms could easily be mistaken for a cold, mononucleosis (mono) or the flu. There are also cases where people don’t show any symptoms at all. The virus is dangerous as it targets CD4 cells. These are a type of white blood cells that fight infection. HIV destroys these cells and spreads throughout the body. Without treatment, the human immunodeficiency virus will destroy more and more CD4 cells and will multiply itself further. The acute infection can progress into a chronic HIV infection, which may then progress into AIDS. More information on this progression can be found on our specific page about AIDS by clicking the link . 1 2 HIV is an STD, or sexually transmitted disease . This means that you can get the virus through unprotected sex with an infected person. It can also be transmitted by sharing medical equipment like syringes. A mother can also pass the virus along to her child while giving birth or while breastfeeding. 3",
    "what_are_common_symptoms": "Early stage HIV symptoms are very common symptoms and could easily be confused with a cold, mononucleosis, or the flu. These symptoms are the result of the body fighting off the infection. The common acute HIV infection symptoms are: Mouth ulcers Red rash: an acute hiv infection rash presents itself as an area of the skin that is irritated , itchy, painful and red. 4 Fever\n\nOther symptoms may also be present such as: 5 6 Aching muscles Joint pains Unintentional weight loss Loss of coordination Tiredness Headache Swollen lymph nodes (check our article about HIV swollen lymph nodes ) Sore throat Diarrhea HIV symptoms appear after 2 weeks in most cases. It’s important to know that these symptoms are also very common for other medical conditions and that some people may even have an acute HIV infection without any symptoms. It’s important to always know your HIV-status and to get tested if you think you’re at risk or if you participate in riskful behavior such as unprotected sex and sharing syringes.",
    "how_long_do_hiv_symptoms_last": "The symptoms of an acute HIV infection can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks . After these symptoms, it’s possible that HIV doesn’t cause any symptoms for several years. That stage is called chronic HIV infection. Even when there are no symptoms, the infection is still present and still proceeds to damage the immune system. The chronic infection can turn into AIDS after years of presence in the blood. It’s important to know that this progression can be slowed down or even prevented by early diagnosis and initiation of correct and early treatment. 6 7",
    "how_soon_can_hiv_be_detected_by_a_blood_test": "As the infection can often be present without symptoms or with non-specific symptoms, it’s important to have bloodwork done if you think you could be at risk for an HIV-infection. An HIV test can come back positive from 10 to 90 days after a risk contact. Acute HIV can be detected in various ways: A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) , which looks for the amount of HIV present in the blood. This is also known as an HIV viral load test. This test can already detect HIV within 10 to 33 days after exposure, which is sooner than other tests. The reason behind this is that the acute stage is characterized by a fast multiplication and a high presence of HIV. The body will start to make antibodies to fight the virus, but this process takes a few weeks, which is why the antibodies are only visible in the blood later on. An antigen/antibody test , which looks for HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. An antibody is a reaction from the immune system, while an antigen is the foreign substance causing the immune system to activate. This test can detect HIV within 18 to 90 days after exposure. An HIV antibody test , which also searches for antibodies in the blood or oral fluid. These are rapid and self-tests, and can detect HIV 23 to 90 days after infection. You should discuss your symptoms and possible risk factors with your doctor to find out which test is right for you. If you think that you’ve been exposed to HIV in the last 72 hours, you can talk to your doctor about taking PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis), which is an emergency medicine which you can take to prevent an HIV infection . If taken within 72 hours of exposure, PEP can be highly effective in preventing HIV. 8 9 10",
    "hiv_faqs": "Q: What is ARS? A: ARS stands for Acute Retroviral Syndrome, which is seen in people with an acute HIV infection that develop symptoms. Q: When do ARS symptoms start? A: ARS symptoms usually start 2 to 6 weeks after infection with HIV. Q: What is PreP? A: PreP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s a medication that some people use to prevent being infected by HIV. Q: How soon do HIV symptoms disappear? A: The symptoms of an acute HIV infection are different in each person, but people that do show symptoms often have these symptoms for a few days up to a few weeks. After this, people with HIV may not show symptoms for several years. Q: Can you have HIV symptoms but test negative at 6 weeks? A: As acute HIV symptoms are very general, they can also be symptoms of another condition. If you’ve tested negative at 6 weeks, you probably don’t have HIV. To be sure, you should test again after 3 months."

    "condition": "Acute Laryngitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-laryngitis/",
    "what_is_acute_laryngitis": "Acute laryngitis is a short-term inflammatory condition affecting the larynx, or voice box, typically lasting less than 3 weeks. 1 Laryngitis which lasts longer than three weeks is called chronic laryngitis; see this resource for more information. Laryngitis can affect people of every age and gender. The main symptoms of laryngitis are a hoarse voice, also known as dysphonia, and sore throat, due to inflammation in the laryngeal area. Acute laryngitis may have infectious or non-infectious causes, including overuse of the voice which puts a strain on the vocal cords, or gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD); laryngitis caused by GERD is called reflux laryngitis. Treatment for laryngitis may include resting the voice, simple pain relief, and home remedies such as drinking warm liquids to soothe the throat. If laryngeal discomfort and other symptoms are still present after three weeks, antibiotics may be prescribed, if the cause is diagnosed to be a bacterial infection. An antifungal medication may be prescribed if the cause is a fungal infection. Most people recover from acute laryngitis within three weeks and do not go on to develop chronic laryngitis.",
    "symptoms": "Typical symptoms of laryngitis include: Dysphonia (hoarseness of the voice) Fever (during the first few days of infection) Sore throat A need to clear the throat frequently A cough Symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen after around three days. 1 After around three weeks, with appropriate treatment including drinking plenty of water and resting the larynx, symptoms such as a cough and hoarse voice usually relieve. Even though acute laryngitis usually relives without the need for medical attention, it is important for an affected person to see a doctor promptly if they: Experience swallowing problems (dysphagia) Cough up blood Have trouble breathing Have a persistent fever, with a temperature of higher than 103 F (39.4 C) Have respiratory problems (breathing difficulties) These symptoms may indicate epiglottitis , a condition in which the tissue that covers the lid of the windpipe becomes inflamed. Epiglottitis can be life-threatening for both children and adults. 2 In children, the symptoms of laryngitis are the same as those in adults. When children under five are affected, the condition is called croup. Croup usually clears up in 5-7 days, and medical attention should be sought if their symptoms of infection do not improve during this timeframe. Antibiotics are not used to treat croup, because it is caused by a viral infection. 3 People experiencing possible symptoms of acute laryngitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "There are both infectious and non-infectious causes of acute laryngitis. The most common causes are flu or cold due to a virus . Non-infectious causes include overuse of the voice, gastric reflux (which can irritate the lining of the throat), or an injury to the voice box region. The hoarseness of the voice (dysphonia) which results from laryngitis is caused by the distorted shape of the inflamed larynx. Because the vocal cords in the larynx are swollen, the air passing over them makes sounds (speech) which are different from normal. Find here more information about laryngitis from Covid .",
    "risks": "While hoarseness of voice persists, it is advisable to avoid overusing one’s voice (shouting or speaking for prolonged periods), because this can result in permanent damage to the vocal cords. It is important to treat the condition before it becomes chronic (long-lasting), because having an inflamed larynx for a prolonged period of time can result in the development of tears and/or growths in the laryngeal tissue, as well as vocal cord strain. See this resource on chronic laryngitis for more information.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually made by examination of the throat. Doctors will focus on diagnosing the cause of the laryngitis, because this will determine the appropriate treatment, if any is needed. If laryngitis is due to a known underlying condition such as gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), the treatment and management plan for this may be adjusted, to prevent further laryngeal problems. Doctors may perform a laryngoscopy to examine the larynx, to help them determine the cause of laryngitis. 4 This may be done indirectly or directly. An indirect laryngoscopy involves the doctor shining a light into the throat to examine the larynx, using a handheld mirror. A direct laryngoscopy involves the doctor inserting a small tube with a camera attached to it into the throat through the mouth to examine the larynx in detail.",
    "treatment": "Treatment depends on the source of the problem but mainly involves resting the larynx by not overusing the voice while hoarseness is present. Drinking warm liquids and using medicated throat lozenges may be useful to soothe the throat. Home remedies such as adding ginger or turmeric to warm drinks can help fight infections. Simple pain medications (ibuprofen or paracetamol) can help with the pain. If the condition is caused by bacteria, the treatment may involve antibiotics.",
    "prevention": "Prevention can be achieved by moderate use of the voice, and taking care to avoid catching or spreading viruses. Giving up smoking may also help to avoid laryngitis.",
    "other_names_for_acute_laryngitis": "Acute inflammation of the larynx",
    "acute_laryngitis_faqs": "Q: Is acute laryngitis contagious? A: Yes. However, the degree to which it is contagious depends on whether the cause(s) of laryngitis are bacterial/fungal, viral, or whether it is due to an underlying condition. Most cases of laryngitis result from viruses, which themselves are not particularly contagious. Research suggests that the most likely time frame for viruses that cause laryngitis to be passed on to others is the period when the infected person has a fever. A person who is only affected by a hoarse voice, sore throat and cough is less likely to be contagious. Instances of bacterial and fungal causes of laryngitis are less common, but these kinds of infections are more contagious than viruses and therefore more likely to result in transmission. Washing hands regularly, particularly after coughing, and avoiding sharing food or utensils, are important preventative measures for avoiding the transmission of laryngitis. Q: What happens when laryngitis becomes chronic? A: Chronic laryngitis is less likely to be caused by bacterial or viral infections than acute laryngitis, and more likely to be caused by an ongoing problem or condition, such as by acid reflux from gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), habitual overuse of the voice which damages the vocal cords, excessive alcohol use, use of tobacco products (especially smoking), or chronic sinusitis . The symptoms of acute (short-lasting) laryngitis are the same as those of chronic (long-lasting) laryngitis, including a sore throat, hoarseness of the voice and having a cough. It is important to seek treatment if symptoms persist, because vocal cord strain and growths on the vocal cords can develop as a result of continual inflammation of the larynx."

Middle ear infections are not as common in adults as they are in children. An infection can be caused by viruses (colds, the flu, etc.) or bacteria. Typical signs of acute otitis media are strong pain in the ear and difficulty hearing. Treatment is pain relief and sometimes requires antibiotics. Most people do not develop any complications and recover well from middle ear infections.",
    "risks": "Acute otitis media is caused by viruses (colds, the flu, ect.) or bacteria. This is why a middle ear infection might begin following an episode of a cold or the flu. People who smoke may be more likely to suffer from middle ear infections. Other conditions that cause swelling in the nose (such as allergies or swelling of the tonsils) may also make middle ear infections more likely, because this swelling blocks off a tube that runs between the nose and middle ear. Blockage of this tube can make it easier for viruses or bacteria to infect the middle ear.",
    "symptoms": "Typical symptoms of a middle ear infection are pain in the ear and difficulty hearing with the affected ear. There may also be headaches and fever. Severe cases may cause a burst eardrum and pus may run from the ear, though this is much more common when children are affected, and is uncommon in adults.",

    "what_is_acute_pancreatitis": "Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ behind the stomach and connected to the bowel. It produces enzymes, which are necessary to break down food during digestion and helps regulate the body's glucose levels by producing the hormones insulin and glucagon. There are several causes of acute pancreatitis. Some of the most common causes are drinking large amounts of alcohol , gallstones and certain medications. Typical symptoms of acute pancreatitis are pain in the upper part of the abdomen and the back, as well as nausea and vomiting. Treatment involves rest, fluids and treating the underlying cause. Around 275,000 people in the United States are hospitalized with acute pancreatitis each year. It is a serious condition, but most people recover well, once the underlying cause is recognized and treated. 1\n\nAcute pancreatitis can be treated and will fully resolve in a few days. Chronic pancreatitis does not heal, worsens over time and causes permanent damage to the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis can be debilitating and lead to death. Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis may lead to chronic pancreatitis. 2",

In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Sixty to seventy-five percent of acute pancreatitis cases are caused by gallstones or high intake of alcohol . There is no identifiable cause for around 20 percent of acute pancreatitis cases; this is known as idiopathic pancreatitis. 5\n\nGallstones can trigger acute pancreatitis by blocking the drainage duct shared by the pancreas and the gallbladder. This stops pancreatic enzymes flowing normally and causes pancreatitis. 5 Read more about Gallstones »\n\nHeavy alcohol use over a prolonged period of time can cause acute pancreatitis. It is unclear how alcohol causes pancreatitis, though there are theories that alcohol may convert into chemicals that damage the pancreas, or that alcohol blocks the pancreatic duct. 3 The risk of pancreatitis increases with heavy alcohol use, which is considered to be: Four to seven drinks a day for men Three or more drinks a day for women If a person with acute pancreatitis drinks less than these amounts, the condition may still progress to chronic pancreatitis. Alcohol should be completely avoided while undergoing treatment for acute pancreatitis.

ERCP uses an endoscope, which is a flexible tube inserted into the esophagus, stomach and intestine to examine the bile and pancreatic ducts. 7\n\nLess common causes of pancreatitis include: 4 8 9 Mumps Mononucleosis/Epstein-Barr virus HIV Parasitic infection, such as ascariasis, toxoplasmosis or cryptosporidium High cholesterol levels Pancreatic cancer",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. A diagnosis will generally be confirmed if two of the following three symptoms are present: 5 Abdominal pain Increases of amylase and lipase levels in the blood that are threefold or higher Inflamed pancreas, seen on a CT scan or MRI scan Blood tests may be ordered to investigate if the pancreas is working properly and to look for signs of inflammation. Blood tests can check for: 3 10 High levels of digestive enzymes made by the pancreas, called amylase and lipase High blood glucose levels High levels of blood fats, called lipids Signs of infection Pancreatic cancer Read about how to interpret Blood Test Results Imaging scans can be used to diagnose acute pancreatitis and also to identify complications such as necrosis, death of living tissue, or fluid collection. Scans that may be performed include: 3 10 Computed tomography (CT) scan, to create a picture of the pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), another method of creating a picture of the pancreas, gallbladder and bile ducts Ultrasound, which can be used to identify gallstones",
    "treatment": "Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition and can lead to complications such as fluid-filled pseudocysts, damage to the pancreas and heart and lung or kidney failure. However, with appropriate treatment, most people recover well. 1 11 People with acute pancreatitis are usually admitted to hospital. Treatment generally includes: Fluids administered intravenously Painkillers Drugs to reduce nausea and vomiting Feeding by tube or intravenously if the person cannot eat Antibiotics , if the person has an infection in the pancreas\n\nIf acute pancreatitis is caused by gallstones , this condition also needs to be treated. There are various options to treat gallstones: Surgical removal of the gallbladder. This is a common procedure and will prevent acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones recurring. 12 Non-surgical options to eliminate gallstones may be possible where a person is unable to have their gallbladder removed, such as because of old age or other medical conditions. However, without gallbladder removal, acute pancreatitis caused by gallstones is likely to recur in 30 to 50 percent of cases. 12 Non-surgical options for eliminating gallstones include: 12 13 Bile acid pill, to break down small gallstones caused by cholesterol Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), to remove gallstones from the bile duct Shock wave lithotripsy, a rarely offered procedure which uses shock waves to break up larger gallstones",
    "preventing_acute_pancreatitis": "Eating a healthy diet that is rich in fiber, fruits, vegetables and whole grains and avoiding unhealthy fats can reduce the risk of developing gallstones. 14 Stopping drinking alcohol and stopping smoking can help prevent future episodes of acute pancreatitis and prevent progression to chronic pancreatitis. 15",
    "acute_pancreatitis_faqs": "Q: Are acute pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer linked? A: If not properly managed, repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. However, most people with pancreatitis will not develop pancreatic cancer. 16",

    "what_is_a_panic_attack": "A panic attack is an abrupt episode characterized by a sudden, intense feeling of fear or discomfort. Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. 1 One’s body goes into fight or flight mode – becoming ready to escape from physical danger – but there is usually no actual source of danger present. Instead, the concurrent mental and physical symptoms of a panic attack occur in response to a buildup of anxious thoughts. A person having a panic attack may feel that they are dying or losing their sanity during the attack. Although this is an inherently distressing experience, panic attacks pose no serious actual health risks. The typical duration of a panic attack episode is between 5 and 20 minutes, after which both the mental and physical symptoms associated with the attack will abate. Practicing therapeutic techniques, in particular breathing exercises, can help an individual to feel better after a panic attack. 1 Panic attacks can affect people of all ages and may occur during any activity and in any location. Many people will experience a panic attack or two during the course of their lifetime, without developing an ongoing problem. Often, a panic attack will be associated with undergoing a particularly stressful life event, such as bereavement, a job change or separating from a partner, but it is also common to be unable to identify a trigger. If a person experiences recurrent panic attacks, this is called panic disorder, a condition which is usually treatable with psychotherapeutic methods and/or medication. Feeling unwell?

    "acute_panic_attack_symptoms": "People who experience a panic attack are not usually aware that the episode is going to occur until it begins, particularly if they have not experienced a panic attack before.\n\nPhysiological changes in the body – such as an increasing heart rate – have been found to occur up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, but the first perceptible signs generally only become apparent as the attack begins. These include symptoms of mental distress, such as the belief that one is dying, and concurrent physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate (palpitations), sweating and trembling. There are typically no perceptible signs of the onset of a panic attack. However, research has been conducted to test the hypothesis that panic attacks occur spontaneously. Findings suggest that imperceptible changes in the body can begin before the actual panic attack starts. Physiological changes, which may take place up to an hour in advance of a panic attack, include: 2 Irregular breathing patterns Increased heart rate However, these physiological indicators are subtle, unlike the symptoms that are present during a panic attack itself. In general, these changes go unnoticed by the affected individual and those around them and do not serve as an advance indicator of the panic attack that they precede.\n\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) , four or more of the following physical and psychological symptoms must be present: 3 Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering Feeling of choking Chest pain or discomfort Nausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint Chills or heat sensations Paresthesias; numbness or tingling sensations Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself) Fear of losing control or going crazy Fear of dying If four or more of the above symptoms are present, it is known as a full-symptom panic attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works .\n\nIt is possible to experience a panic attack, in which less than four of the above symptoms are present, which is called a limited-symptom panic attack. Limited-symptom panic attacks are often experienced by people undergoing effective treatment for panic disorder, as they learn to use therapeutic techniques to reduce the number and severity of the symptoms they experience during an attack.\n\nThe duration of a panic attack is usually between five and 20 minutes, with most panic attacks reaching their peak at around 10 minutes. Nearly all panic attacks subside in under an hour, at which point the physical and psychological symptoms will be alleviating or no longer be present. It is normal to feel exhausted and shaken by the experience of having a panic attack after the attack itself is over, and there are many techniques, such as breathing exercises, which can help one begin to feel better.\n\nIt is possible for a person to become so distressed by a panic attack that, rather than calming down afterwards, they experience a recurrent panic attack or several. One should not be concerned about one’s long-term health if one experiences one or more subsequent attacks after the initial episode, as there are no long-term health consequences. Learning coping techniques, such as breathing exercises to perform in the event of a panic attack, can help one calm down efficiently, reducing the likelihood of recurrent panic attacks.\n\nIt is possible to experience a panic attack in one’s sleep. This is called a nocturnal panic attack and involves waking up in a state of panic. 4 Nocturnal panic attacks are no different from panic attacks that occur when one is awake, in terms of their symptoms, duration and possible triggers. Nocturnal panic attacks are a common occurrence in people with panic disorder, but can also be one’s first or only experience of a panic attack.\n\nThe symptoms of a panic attack can be similar to those of a heart attack. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works . It is common for people experiencing a panic attack to become convinced that they are having a heart attack during the episode. Although this may be related to the distressing thoughts that accompany a panic attack, emergency medical services should be called if a heart attack is suspected, as – unlike a panic attack – a heart attack requires prompt medical attention and can be life-threatening. Key differences between a heart attack and a panic attack include: The location of the tingling sensation. In a heart attack, a person may experience a tingling sensation in their left arm, whereas in a panic attack the tingling sensation, if present, will affect the entire body. The extent to which breathing speeds up. A panic attack often causes hyperventilation (breathing too quickly) but a heart attack does not. However, both panic and heart attacks can cause the sensation of shortness of breath. The likelihood of vomiting. It is common to vomit during a heart attack, but less common to do so during a panic attack. Pain in a panic attack will feel like a sharp sensation, and will feel worse when one breathes deeply or puts pressure on the chest. It will usually be felt all over the heart. It will disappear within five to ten minutes. Pain in a heart attack will feel like a crushing feeling all over the chest and may extend into the shoulders, left arm, neck and back. It will last longer than ten minutes and will not be made worse by breathing or pressing on the chest. Despite being able to identify these differences, it is advisable to always seek medical attention if the affected person: 5 Has a history of heart attacks Meets the risk criteria for a heart attack, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, getting limited physical exercise Has never had a panic attack before If one is not deemed to be at risk of a heart attack, psychotherapeutic techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be recommended in order to help the affected person overcome any long-term anxiety about having a heart attack. This will help prevent a fear of having a heart attack from manifesting in, or forming the basis of, future panic attacks.",
    "causes": "Anxiety disorder (AD) is the principal cause of all panic attacks. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), approximately 40 million adults in the U.S. between the ages of 18 and 51 are diagnosed as being affected by anxiety disorders. However, the total number of people who are affected by anxiety disorders – and who are therefore predisposed to experience a panic attack – is thought to be far greater. 6 Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. As such, a panic attack is caused by heightened anxiety, whereby the body undergoes physiological changes due to one’s thoughts, entering into a state called fight or flight mode. A person may not be consciously aware of the thoughts that induce this state, as it can be caused by the brain’s background activity. Fight or flight mode is an automatic response to danger, rapidly preparing the body for physical activity, such as running away from or fighting off a predator. In a panic attack, however, there is usually no immediate physical threat to escape from. 7 Physiological changes associated with fight or flight mode, that may contribute to a panic attack, include: Increased metabolic rate Increased heart rate Release of metabolic energy resources such as glycogen Inhibited action of the digestive system Constriction of blood vessels Loss of hearing and dilation of pupils Relaxation of the bladder and sphincters\n\nStress is a principal factor in experiencing a panic attack. A panic attack may relate to life events that are stressful for a given individual in the short term, such as giving a presentation or boarding an airplane. However, continuous stressors, such as having a job one dislikes or an emotionally unhealthy relationship, can also increase one’s predisposition to anxiety and can therefore be triggers for panic attacks. 8 In research , stress related to illness and interpersonal conflict has been cited as the most common known triggers of panic attacks by affected people. It is also common to be unable to pinpoint the trigger(s) of one’s panic attack. People, who experience panic attacks, often describe their mental state as being calm prior to the unexpected attack, and panic attacks can also affect people who do not consider themselves to be under stress. This may be because the anxious thoughts which generate the panic attack are subconscious rather than conscious. Panic attacks can occur in any situation or location. Panic attacks in public spaces ‒ such as shopping centers and public transportation ‒ are particularly common. 9 In people with panic disorder, situations or locations, in which one has already experienced a panic attack, can often become triggers for future panic attacks, as they can develop negative associations due to the fear of experiencing a panic attack again. Situations, in which panic attacks commonly occur include: 10 Being in a crowded place Driving Being on public transport Boarding or being inside a plane People with panic disorder often experience a reduced quality of life, because they make lifestyle changes that are designed to avoid trigger situations, such as avoiding crowded places.",
    "risk_factors_for_experiencing_a_panic_attack": "Although anyone may be affected by a panic attack, a range of factors may increase the likelihood for certain individuals. People who have a disorder that leads to elevated levels of anxiety are more likely to experience a panic attack. This includes: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A form of chronic anxiety that is often unrelated to a particular cause. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In the case of OCD, a person experiences recurrent unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors. This can lead to panic attacks in some people, although, according to DSM-5 criteria, OCD is no longer listed as anxiety disorder. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although PTSD is a trauma and stressor-related disorder rather than an anxiety disorder, panic attacks may relate to anxiety from PTSD, that develops after first or second-hand exposure to a traumatic event. Social phobia. In people with social phobia, everyday situations regularly cause debilitating levels of anxiety. Other mental health conditions, such as depression, can also cause the anxious kinds of thinking that may precipitate a panic attack. 11 Other factors, which increase one’s likelihood of experiencing a panic attack, include: 3 Heredity. The exact link between people’s genetic makeup and their predisposition to panic attacks is not yet fully understood, but people with panic disorder often have family members – particularly siblings – who are also affected. 12 Intelligence. Having a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is associated with introspection. Spending lots of time alone, thinking, can lead to the development of the anxious thought cycles that precipitate panic attacks. Temperament. Being prone to experiencing negative emotions (negative affectivity), and being prone to believing that one’s anxiety symptoms are harmful (anxiety sensitivity), are both contributing factors to the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack. 13 Environment. Many people experience a panic attack as a result of stressors in their immediate environment, such as a currently stressful life experience. However, previous stressors can increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack in later life, and childhood trauma and abuse are common among those who are affected by panic attacks or panic disorder in adulthood. Consuming certain chemicals. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol excessively , illicit substance misuse and adverse reactions to prescription medication are also linked to an increased likelihood of experiencing a panic attack. Health problems. it is not uncommon for people experiencing ongoing ill health to develop anxiety related to their condition and prognosis. This can happen whether or not one’s health problem(s) is/are biologically conducive to anxiety or not, in the sense that they involve physical changes conducive to developing anxiety or fight or flight mode. Biological causes. Certain conditions affect factors, like one’s hormone levels, breathing and heart rate, increasing the chances of one’s body unnecessarily entering fight or flight mode, which can cause a panic attack. Conditions which increase the likelihood of experiencing a panic attack include: Hyperthyroidism , i.e. excessive production of the thyroid hormone Hypoglycemia ‒ low blood sugar Wilson’s disease, an excessive deposition of copper in the brain, liver and other tissues Labyrinthitis, an inflammation in the nerves of the inner ear Mitral valve prolapse, when the mitral valve in the heart does not close as tightly as in healthy people Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, an abnormal increase in heart rate after sitting up or standing Pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland tissue",
    "when_to_seek_medical_attention": "The first time one experiences a panic attack, one should seek medical attention promptly in order to check one’s overall physical and mental health and discuss the possibility and prevention of future panic attacks. It is not uncommon for an individual, who has experienced a panic attack, to feel embarrassment in telling their family or doctor. Many people are unaware of how common it is to experience a panic attack and/or that it could relate to panic disorder or another form of anxiety ‒ conditions, which are highly treatable with appropriate psychotherapy and/or medication. Even if one is not diagnosed with a mental health condition, one’s doctor will be able to advise on management techniques in the event that a future panic attack occurs and will be able to perform check-ups to rule out other conditions or health concerns. For example, one may be screened to rule out the risk of a heart attack, particularly if one believed that one was experiencing a heart attack during the episode.\n\nExperiencing a panic attack is inherently distressing for the individual involved, especially if they were previously unaware of being affected by any form of anxiety. The possibility of experiencing a future panic attack ‒ particularly if one encounters scenarios similar to the circumstances of the initial attack ‒ is a common concern, but feeling this way does not necessarily mean that one will experience future panic attacks. Furthermore, it is possible to experience one or more panic attacks without being affected by a related condition , such as anxiety disorder or panic disorder. Many people, who do not normally have anxiety or depressive disorders, experience one or more panic attacks in relation to a specific stressor or over the course of a lifetime.\n\nFor some individuals, experiencing a panic attack may be an indication that they have an ongoing mental health condition. According to the DSM-5 Manual, the principal conditions which may be diagnosed after experiencing a panic attack, include: 3\n\nRecurrent panic attacks that are not related to another condition will be diagnosed as panic disorder, which is treatable with psychotherapy and/or anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) medications. To be diagnosed with panic disorder, an individual must have experienced frequent, full-symptom panic attacks, which are not caused by a concurrent health condition or chemically induced. The extent to which one’s panic attacks impact one’s daily life between episodes will also be considered ‒ most people with panic disorder present with debilitating anxiety about the possibility of future panic attacks. People with panic disorder are likely to experience panic attacks in situations which replicate or resemble the circumstances of a previous panic attack, such as being in a crowd or before public speaking. This can have a negative impact on a person’s day-to-day routine, as many people choose to avoid situations which may provoke a panic attack, thereby experiencing a diminished quality of life. 1 Panic disorder usually occurs concurrently with other anxiety disorders. It is fairly rare for panic disorder to occur on its own. Conditions which most commonly co-occur with panic disorder include: 3 Other anxiety disorders, in particular agoraphobia Bipolar disorder Mild alcohol-use disorder Depression If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by one of these conditions, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nOne’s likelihood of experiencing a panic attack is increased if one is affected by a form of anxiety disorder (AD). A panic attack can therefore be an indicator that one is affected by generalized anxiety disorder or a specific type of AD. One may be diagnosed with panic disorder in addition to another type of anxiety disorder. Mental health conditions, which feature anxiety and may be diagnosed following a panic attack, include: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). A form of chronic anxiety that is often unrelated to a particular cause. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). In the case of OCD, a person experiences recurrent unwanted thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety, which develops after first or second-hand exposure to a traumatizing event. Social phobia. In people with social phobia, everyday situations regularly cause debilitating levels of anxiety. Anxiety disorder caused by another medical condition. See the list of conditions related to anxiety in the “Risk factors for experiencing a panic attack” section of this resource. Read more about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder »\n\nOne will not be diagnosed with panic disorder if one’s panic attack(s) is/are primarily attributable to the use of one or more substances. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is commonly related to: 3 Use of central nervous system stimulants, such as nicotine, caffeine, amphetamines and cocaine Withdrawal from central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol and barbiturates Misuse of illicit substances and/or uncontrolled use of prescription medications Many people self-medicate with legal and/or illicit substances and alcohol as a means of managing their anxiety and/or preventing panic attacks. Even when used as a form of self-medication, the use of illicit substances can increase the likelihood of panic attacks. A detailed medical history will be taken in cases where panic attacks coincide with substance use, focusing on: The timeline of one’s use of certain substances The timeline of one’s panic attack(s) and whether it/they relate to one’s substance use One’s medical profile before beginning substance use One’s medical profile before beginning to have panic attacks",
    "treatment": "If one’s doctor diagnoses a mental health condition, such as panic disorder or another form of anxiety disorder, as a result of one’s consultation about panic attack(s), then an appropriate treatment plan will be devised. This will usually involve psychotherapy and/or medication, tailored to the needs of the individual and to managing their diagnosed condition(s). This section provides advice on how to manage a panic attack during the episode itself and on the prevention of future panic attacks.\n\nAlthough a panic attack comes on suddenly, often with no prior indication that it is going to happen, its initial symptoms intensify, and it tends to reach its peak after around 10 minutes. One can begin deploying various coping strategies to reduce the severity of a panic attack as soon as one notices the first signs. Techniques which are useful in navigating a panic attack focus on calming the mind and body. Used effectively, they can reduce the severity of a given panic attack or prevent its initial stages developing into a full-symptom panic attack. Many helpful techniques related to managing a panic attack or preventing future episodes are derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses on making changes to a person’s usual thought processes and behavior in relation to particular concepts. Strategies for managing an oncoming panic attack include: 14\n\nA panic attack causes one’s muscles to tense up, so performing muscle relaxing exercises,  focused on relaxing both specific muscle groups and one’s entire body, can help calm the body during a panic attack.\n\nIt is important to give oneself the space and time to experience and recover from a panic attack. If at work or at a social occasion, walk away and, if possible, find a quiet area in which to experience the panic attack and employ coping strategies such as breathing techniques. Interruptions from others, however well-intentioned, can make it difficult to focus on restoring the body and mind to a calmer state.\n\nThere are many CBT techniques designed to help with deconstructing anxious thoughts and restoring calm during and after a panic attack. Doctors or psychotherapists will be able to recommend techniques appropriate to each person's mental health status and the nature of their panic attack(s).\n\nThe sensation of shortness of breath is one of the most commonly experienced symptoms of a panic attack. This is primarily due to the fact that panic causes breathing to become irregular. Re-regulating one's breathing is one of the most important methods for restoring the body to its pre-panic state. Breathing techniques for panic attacks focus on encouraging a person to breathe deeply and to breathe from the stomach rather than the chest. Many people begin to breathe in a shallow manner during a panic attack. This can inspire the sensation of shortness of breath, which can intensify the panic attack. It is important to remember that the sensation of shortness of breath is not actually dangerous, although it may contribute to one’s perception that one is dying during the panic attack episode. Many people find it helpful to breathe into a paper bag during a panic attack. Inhaling recycled air is believed to raise the carbon dioxide levels in the blood, which can help to end a panic attack. 15",
    "prevention": "Preventing future panic attacks involves identifying the causal stressors and adopting self-care habits which can reduce one’s propensity to anxious thought processes. It is important not to adapt one’s routine in a way which involves avoiding situations and circumstances related to one’s panic attacks. Not only will this become debilitating, but avoidance can result in developing additional anxiety disorders such as social phobia. 15 Techniques for preventing panic attacks include: Daily breathing exercises. These encourage deep breathing and combat one’s tendency to adopt the irregular or shallow breathing patterns. Shallow breathing is a symptom of panic attacks. Additionally, usually practicing irregular or shallow breathing can contribute to a person being in an anxious mindset in general , which makes experiencing a panic attack more likely. Adopting cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. CBT techniques can change the thought processes which contribute to panic attacks. Daily use of CBT techniques can reduce one’s overall anxiety over time, helping to prevent panic attacks in the long term. Regular exercise, especially aerobic exercise can release tension, improve one’s breathing and increase one’s self-esteem, which can reduce one’s predisposition to the  anxious thought cycles that induce panic attacks. Dietary changes which can help prevent panic attacks include: Avoiding stimulants, such as caffeine and tobacco Avoiding alcohol , in particular, avoiding drinking alcohol to excess as a coping strategy for anxiety or panic attacks Eating regular, balanced meals to promote stable blood sugar levels and general well-being Good to know: Withdrawal from alcohol can be a contributing factor to panic attacks. Read more about Alcohol Withdrawal »",
    "panic_attack_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between an anxiety attack and a panic attack? A: A panic attack is a specialized medical term which can be identified using the DSM-5 criteria, as quoted in this resource. In contrast, an anxiety attack is an increasingly medically-recognized concept, but it does not yet pertain to an established set of diagnostic criteria. In general, people who experience anxiety attacks describe periods in which they feel intense anxiety, but this does not necessarily involve the same level of acute distress as a panic attack or the delusional thinking, such as believing that one is dying, or entry into fight or flight mode. 15 If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by anxiety, panic disorder or another mental health condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app . Q: Is it possible to have a panic attack in one’s sleep? A: Yes. A panic attack which occurs in one’s sleep is called a nocturnal panic attack. It involves waking up in a panic, and the symptoms and management strategies are the same as in a panic attack that occurs when one is awake."

    "what_is_acute_pharyngitis": "Pharyngitis , or acute pharyngitis, colloquially sometimes called cobblestone throat, is an inflammation of the back of the throat, otherwise known as the pharynx. The condition generally causes pain and a sensation of scratchiness in the region of the throat, as well as difficulty swallowing. 1 The condition is typically referred to as a sore throat.\n\nPharyngitis is a very common complaint, usually caused by a viral infection, or, more rarely, a bacterial infection. In the majority of cases, it will disappear within a week, though can last longer. Treatment will usually focus on managing the symptoms. However, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the bacterial form of the condition. Generally, it is a non-serious condition, though in some instances it can cause severe symptoms or a serious infection.\n\nPharyngitis is usually a temporary condition , lasting for roughly one week. In a small number of cases, however, a sore throat can be recurring, becoming a condition known as chronic pharyngitis . The chronic form of the condition has a variety of possible causes, including persistent infection and stomach acid reflux . If pharyngitis lasts for weeks, it is probably chronic rather than acute pharyngitis. Smoking, vaping and exposure to other forms of smoke, such as industrial or woodsmoke, can all cause a chronic sore throat.",
    "acute_pharyngitis_symptoms": "A variety of symptoms are associated with pharyngitis, with some of the most common including: 2 Sore throat Pain or difficulty when swallowing or talking Swollen, sore glands in the neck or throat Red throat and red, swollen tonsils A hoarse voice White or grey patches on the back of the throat A sore throat is the characteristic symptom of pharyngitis and – in some cases – may be the only symptom. A cobblestone appearance at the back of the throat, colloquially known as “ cobblestone throat ”, is in some cases present. This is a distinctive lumpy, irritated appearance of the back of the throat, caused by enlarged lymphatic tissue. It is visible on visual inspection. It can also be caused by a post-nasal drip , in which mucus that accumulates in the back of the nose and throat drips downward from the back of the nose. Commonly, pharyngitis is caused by an underlying condition such as a common cold or flu . If this is the case, it may be accompanied by symptoms of these conditions, such as fever, coughing or a runny nose.",
    "acute_pharyngitis_cause": "Pharyngitis is usually caused by the viruses that also cause a common cold or flu. In rare cases, the condition can be caused by bacteria. It is difficult to determine whether a case of pharyngitis has a viral or bacterial cause, since the symptoms are similar. 3 Smoking, vaping and exposure to airborne irritants can also cause a sore throat.\n\nViral conditions that can lead to pharyngitis include: Flu Common cold (adenovirus infection) Measles Chickenpox Mononucleosis (mono, caused by the Epstein-Barr virus ) Croup (a childhood illness) Herpes simplex infection Enterovirus infection The viruses that cause the condition are contagious, normally spread by discharge from the nose or mouth. A virus can also survive on objects or clothing and be spread in this way.\n\nA sore, scratchy throat is a major symptom of mononucleosis, also known as mono or glandular fever, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Mononucleosis of this kind is most common among teenagers and younger adults. Other symptoms include: 4 1 Severe fatigue Appetite loss Fever Muscle pain Swollen lymph nodes Some people may also develop a rash. Tonsillitis can often occur in mononucleosis.\n\nIn acute HIV infection , pharyngitis is a common symptom. The symptoms of pharyngitis associated with HIV infection are the same as those of mononucleosis-related pharyngitis (see above), and also often present with tonsillitis. Symptoms that may occur in people affected by pharyngitis accompanying HIV infection are: 4 Fever Sweats Malaise and lethargy Lack of appetite Swollen lymph glands .\n\nA number of bacterial infections can also cause pharyngitis, most commonly Streptococcal bacteria, otherwise known as Group A streptococcus. In these cases, the condition is known as strep throat. Other bacteria that far less frequently cause pharyngitis include: 1 Neisseria gonorrhoeae Corynebacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Group C, G or F Streptococcus Group A streptococcus is the most common cause of tonsillitis (15-30% of cases). Good to know: Group B streptococcus is not usually associated with strep throat or other upper respiratory tract infections. However, group B strep can cause pharyngitis, with tonsillitis and swollen lymph glands in the neck.\n\nStrep throat is typically spread through person-to-person contact, commonly through bacteria in saliva or nasal discharge. Symptoms and signs of strep throat include: 5 A sore throat and pain when swallowing which is more severe than with a normal sore throat. Fever, weakness and headache. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain , especially in children. White or grey patches visible on the back of the throat. Swollen, sore glands in the neck (lymph nodes). A widespread red rash. If the strep throat symptoms occur after several days of coughing and a runny nose, it’s more likely that they are the result of a viral infection rather than Group A streptococcus. 3 Read more about COVID-19 vs. strep throat symptoms >>",
    "diagnosis": "A doctor will usually diagnose the condition through a physical examination that may include: A close look at the throat, ears and nasal passageway Checking for swollen glands Listening to a person’s breathing using a stethoscope If bacterial pharyngitis is suspected , a doctor may also take a swab from the throat and have it tested for the presence of bacteria.\n\nPharyngitis is a common symptom in tonsillitis, so much so that the condition is sometimes known as tonsillopharyngitis. Tonsillitis is a condition in which the tonsils in the throat become inflamed. It can be caused by viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, or bacteria, such as Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus. Most cases of acute tonsillitis are viral, but chronic or recurring tonsillitis is usually bacterial in origin. 6 The symptoms of bacterial tonsillitis usually develop suddenly. They include: 6 A red and swollen throat that is painful Fever Difficulty swallowing or painful swallowing Foul breath Painful lymph nodes in the neck In viral tonsillitis, the affected person may also have: A headache An earache Nasal congestion or stuffiness A cough Very swollen tonsils may cause airway obstruction. The symptoms of airway obstruction include: 6 Breathing through the mouth Snoring Disordered breathing during sleep Lethargy and a general feeling of unwellness If the affected person has difficulty opening their mouth, or their voice takes on a muffled quality as if they are speaking with a hot potato in their mouth, they may have peritonsillar abscess. This is an abscess around the region of the tonsils, and is a medical emergency, because it can cause sepsis and airway obstruction. For more information on the symptoms and treatment of this painful throat condition, see this resource on tonsillitis.\n\nLaryngitis is a condition where the larynx, or voice box, becomes inflamed due to overuse or a viral infection. The most common cause is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract; bacterial laryngitis is rare. 7 It is often found in conjunction with a sore throat, or pharyngitis. Coughing is linked to laryngitis, and therefore it often occurs in conjunction with diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia , influenza, measles, whooping cough or diphtheria. Symptoms of laryngitis include: 7 Hoarseness or other changes in voice Tickling sensations in the throat A raw throat An urge to clear the throat If a severe viral infection is present, the affected person may also have: 7 Fever Malaise Difficulty swallowing Sore throat. In some cases, a sore throat and voice changes might be caused by laryngeal cancer . This cancer is, however, quite rare. Important risk factors include smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Human papillomavirus infection and gastroesophageal reflux disease can also increase a person’s risk of laryngeal cancer.",
    "acute_pharyngitis_treatment": "Most cases of pharyngitis will go away without treatment in a week or less. Antibiotics are not helpful in cases of pharyngitis caused by viral infections, and are only used in cases where a bacterial infection is lingering. Most treatment for pharyngitis can be carried out at home, using over-the-counter products.\n\nThere are a number of ways to help manage the symptoms of the condition: 8 Drinking plenty of fluids is key to avoiding dehydration, which can make the symptoms of pharyngitis worse. Taking over the counter painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, is a good way of managing pain, headaches and fever. These medicines should be taken according to the instructions on the packet. Lozenges can be useful in easing pain. Other over-the-counter products, such as anesthetic sprays, which can be bought from pharmacies and stores, can also help alleviate certain symptoms.\n\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral pharyngitis, though, they may be prescribed for those with a bacterial infection. Doctors are often reluctant to prescribe antibiotics for bacterial pharyngitis due to the fact that they are not always effective and may cause side-effects. To decide if an individual should be prescribed antibiotics, doctors will sometimes use a test known as the Centor score. They will look for: 8 Pus on the tonsils Painful or tender glands on the neck The absence of a cough Fever If three or more of these features are present, a doctor will often prescribe a delayed prescription, whereby antibiotics will be prescribed for two or three days in the future, to be used if symptoms have not disappeared or have gotten worse.",
    "pharyngitis_prevention": "Pharyngitis is contagious , meaning there are a number of ways to reduce the risk of contracting the condition. These include: 1 Avoiding sharing utensils, food and drink Avoiding contact with people experiencing the condition Thorough and frequent washing of the hands, especially after coughing or sneezing and before eating",
    "complications": "In the vast majority of cases, pharyngitis is a relatively harmless condition that will clear quickly without complications. Very rarely, however, the condition can progress and cause complications. It can also be a warning sign for a range of more serious conditions. 8 Possible complications include the infection spreading from the throat to nearby locations, causing, for example, an ear infection , sinus infection or less frequently pneumonia . However, this is unlikely to happen if the pharyngitis is appropriately managed. If symptoms persist or are particularly severe, a doctor’s diagnosis should be sought.",

    "pharyngitis_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between pharyngitis and laryngitis? A: Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx, whereas laryngitis is an inflammation of the larynx, or the voice box. The main symptom of laryngitis is hoarseness or complete loss of the voice. Usually, treatment for both conditions is similar. 9 Q: What is the difference between pharyngitis and tonsillitis? A: Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx, whereas tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils, a pair of tissue masses at the rear of the throat. Symptoms of tonsillitis include soreness in the lower throat and hoarseness of the voice. 10 Pharyngitis and tonsillitis can occur at the same time – when this occurs, the condition is referred to as pharyngotonsillitis. 11 Q: What is strep throat? A: Strep throat is a bacterial sore throat caused by Streptococcal bacteria, otherwise known as group A streptococcus. The pain and difficulty swallowing experienced as a result of strep throat are typically more severe than in cases of a viral sore throat. Moreover, symptoms not associated with a viral sore throat may also be experienced. These include: Fever, weakness, and headache. White or grey patches visible on the back of the throat. Swollen, sore glands in the neck (lymph nodes). A widespread red rash. Nausea, vomiting,g and abdominal pain."

    "what_is_acute_pyelonephritis": "Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidneys. While most episodes clear without causing lasting renal damage , it can be severe and is usually quite painful, although few patients will need to be hospitalised. 1 This condition is most common among young adult women, but can affect anyone of any age. 2 Men are at relatively low risk of acute pyelonephritis, unless they are older than 65 years of age. 3",
    "causes_and_risk_factors_risks": "Most cases of acute pyelonephritis occur when bacteria, that are present in the gastrointestinal tract, come into contact with the urethra, move into the bladder and travel upward from the bladder to the kidneys. 1 In rare cases, the condition can arise hematogenously, which means that the bacteria which cause it originate and travel in the blood. Some of the bacteria most commonly implicated in such infections are: 2 3 Escherichia coli,more commonly referred to as e. coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus saprophyticus Group B streptococci Enterococci Other enterobacteriaceae Klebsiella spp. Corynbacterium urealyticum Mycobacteria In rare cases, yeasts and fungi may also be implicated. However, e. coli is by far the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), the backward flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys, may also lead to acute pyelonephritis, as the refluxing urine can possibly carry bacteria. 3 Although pyelonephritis can occur among any group of people, young women are most at risk, particularly between the ages of 15 and 29. This may have to do with the role of frequent sexual intercourse in introducing bacteria to the exterior opening of the urethra and from there to the bladder. The use of spermicidal contraceptives can increase the risk of pyelonephritis, as well as cystitis and other urinary tract infections, because they destroy the natural protective barrier of bacteria that should be in the vaginal area and allow enteric bacteria to colonise the area instead. 2 New sexual partners can also increase one’s risk of a urinary tract infection (UTI) , with more frequent sexual intercourse increasing the risk of potentially introducing new bacteria. There is some medical evidence that women with diabetes may be at slightly higher risk of contracting UTIs and consequently acute pyelonephritis. 4 Urinary tract infections (UTIs) also increase an individual’s susceptibility to acute pyelonephritis. Many of the bacteria associated with pyelonephritis are the same as those which can cause cystitis. In addition, women whose mothers have a history of UTIs may be more vulnerable to acute pyelonephritis. Other factors that increase an individual’s risk of developing acute pyelonephritis include: 2 3 Diabetes mellitus Stress urinary incontinence A structurally or functionally abnormal genitourinary tract, such as might result from infected cysts, underdeveloped kidneys, spinal cord injuries, or VUR. Catheterisation Stents or drainage procedures in or around the kidneys Pregnancy Biliary cirrhosis, a chronic condition where bile ducts in the liver are damaged Prostate enlargement Immunocompromised states, such as might occur during chemotherapy. If you are concerned that you or someone you may have acute pyelonephritis, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",
    "symptoms": "The most distinctive features of acute pyelonephritis are pain in the back, flank or belly, fever at or above 38 C / 100.4 F, chills, nausea and vomiting. If flank, belly or back pain is not present, doctors should consider other diagnoses. Other symptoms of pyelonephritis include: 1 2 Urine that has an unusual or unpleasant smell Hematuria (blood in the urine) Urinary frequency Urinary urgency Dysuria (painful or difficult urination) Oliguria (lack of urine) Hypotension (low blood pressure). In babies and toddlers, a high fever may be the only symptom. In men and women older than 65 years of age, the above-mentioned symptoms may be absent and additional symptoms may include: Confusion Jumbled speech Hallucinations. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works .\n\nSome conditions increase the risk of acute pyelonephritis becoming complicated. In these cases, hospitalisation may be required. These conditions include: 1 Anatomical abnormalities of the genitourinary system Multi-drug-resistant bacteria underlying the infection A weakened immune system, for example as a result of chemotherapy or HIV/AIDS Obstructions in the urethra, bladder or ureters Use of inappropriate antibiotics as the first course of treatment Underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus , existing renal dysfunction, liver or cardiac disease or urological disorders",
    "diagnosing_acute_pyelonephritis": "Apart from noting the symptoms mentioned above, doctors examining a patient with suspected acute pyelonephritis will obtain a urine sample from them, and perform a basic test for abnormal color and odor. Additionally, they may perform tests such as: 2 5 Dipstick analysis, which may be positive for blood, nitrite or leukocyte esterase. The latter is an enzyme produced by white blood cells. Urinalysis (analysis of the urine) to check for white blood cell casts and microscopic pyuria, i.e. pus in the urine. A bacterial culture of the urine to determine what kind of bacteria has caused the pyelonephritis. This may be particularly useful if the first line of antibiotic treatments does not clear up the infection, suggesting that the bacteria is drug-resistant or that another pathogen is responsible. Blood tests, such as a complete blood count should be performed in more complicated cases, along with analysis of inflammation markers. Markers that can indicate declining kidney function, and measurement of electrolytes may be necessary, too. Imaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound. Doctors will also take a history from the patient to determine whether any underlying disorders, such as a genitourinary abnormality or diabetes mellitus, are present and gather information about their lifestyle, for example, whether or not the patient is sexually active, experiences stress urinary incontinence , etc to find out what may have caused the infection to set in.",
    "treatment": "Most people affected by  acute pyelonephritis are successfully treated with  antibiotics and do not need to be hospitalised. However, in cases of very severe and/or complicated infections, hospitalisation may be safest in order to monitor the infection consistently and to control its spread most effectively. Hospitalisation can be avoided if treatment is sought early on in the course of the infection.\n\nBed rest, painkillers and hydration are the cornerstones of home treatment for acute pyelonephritis. Staying well hydrated helps to heal the kidneys and flush out the pathogens. However, over-hydration is counterproductive and should be avoided. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen can be taken orally to manage pain. 6 The most common form of treatment for acute pyelonephritis is antibiotics. In some cases, the infection may involve drug-resistant strains of bacteria or the wrong dosage or wrong drug is prescribed. 2 In such instances, antibiotics will not work and the risk of developing complications increases. However, antibiotics generally do work. Some of the oral antibiotics most commonly prescribed are: 2 7 8 Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin), in areas where drug resistance is low Ceftriaxone Gentamicin Oral beta-lactam antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are generally not helpful. There is considerable resistance to fluoroquinolones among E. coli bacteria, and so treatment with such antibiotics may not be efficacious. 2 9\n\nIn cases of severe or complicated infection, hospitalisation is advised. Much like home treatment, inpatient treatment involves antibiotics, painkillers and monitoring for approximately five days and possibly longer, depending on local practice. In some cases, surgery may be required to deal with underlying conditions causing complications, such as enlarged prostate or kidney stones. Also, in severe cases, surgery may be necessary to drain pus away from the kidneys. Antibiotics may be delivered intravenously into a vein in the arm, via a drip, including: 2 7 8 Cephalosporins like Ceftriaxone Aminoglycosides like Gentamicin or Tobramycin Carbapenems like Meropenem Broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics like piperacillin, in combination with tazobactam There are certain circumstances in which a patient should be hospitalised. Sepsis and septic shock are serious complications of acute pyelonephritis, and if any signs of sepsis are present, the patient should be hospitalised without delay. Other circumstances suggesting that hospitalisation would be wise include: 3 Metabolic problems, such as acidosis A fever of more than 39℃/102℉ Signs of, or risk of, sepsis (see below) Dehydration and/or inability to take liquids or medications by mouth Very severe flank or abdominal pain , vomiting and debility Oliguria or anuria: very little or no urine being produced Social issues, such as homelessness or an unsafe home environment Likelihood that the patient will not cooperate with treatment at home Inadequate access to follow-up care, for example poor patients or patients living in rural areas, living alone or without transport Signs of sepsis include: 10 11 High fever above 38℃/100.4℉ OR low body temperature (below 36℃/96.8℉). Tachypnoea (rapid breathing) Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) Hypotension (low blood pressure) Edema Mottled skin Dizziness Confusion, sleepiness, lethargy and/or irritability In some cases, an affected person may run a fever and their body temperature then drop to below 36℃/96.8℉ or vice versa. Medical assistance should be sought. In children, signs of sepsis include laboured breathing, listlessness, loss of appetite, floppiness, fretfulness, green or black vomit and irritability. Sepsis and septic shock can be fatal, particularly among children. If these signs appear, seek emergency medical help immediately . Read more about Sepsis »",
    "faqs": "Q: Can I prevent acute pyelonephritis? A: Acute pyelonephritis cannot be entirely prevented, but the risk can be minimised. Remaining adequately hydrated flushes potentially harmful microorganisms and urine out of the bladder and urethra, reducing the risk of infection. Avoiding spermicides and vaginal douches, as well as urinating after sex (for both men and women) also removes potentially dangerous bacteria from the area of the urethra and urethral opening. Urinating when the urge arises, rather than waiting to do so, and fully emptying the bladder lower the risk of kidney infections. 12 In cases where infection arises, the period of recovery can be shortened by promptly seeking medical attention. Q: Frequent sexual intercourse is listed as a cause of UTIs and a risk factor for acute pyelonephritis, but what is “frequent sexual intercourse?” and why is it so important? A: The decision how often to have sexual intercourse is very individual and dependent on the personal situation and preferences. Any frequency, as well as having no sex at all, is acceptable, as long as everyone is respected and satisfied. 13 Some studies have found that sex three or more times a week, or ten times in the last month, increases the risk of getting a UTI. 14 It does seem to be the case that frequent sex is the major risk factor for getting a UTI. About 80% of women with a UTI have had sex within the last day. 15 The cause of this high risk appears to be that, during sex, new bacteria, usually from the enteric tract and anal area, are introduced to the vaginal and urethral area. New partners carry new combinations of bacteria and have different effects on skin pH, among other things. However, smoking and having previously had a UTI also increase risk. Anatomical differences between women, like the size of the pelvis and vaginal pH, may also affect risk. Q: Does cystitis or urinary tract infection increase my risk of acute pyelonephritis? A: Cystitis is a very common urinary tract infection, specifically an inflammatory infection of the bladder. Many of the bacteria that cause acute pyelonephritis can cause cystitis. Many of the symptoms are similar to those of acute pyelonephritis. 16 Both men and women can get cystitis. Recurrent, severe and/or untreated cystitis can increase the risk of acute pyelonephritis. Q: I am male; how serious is my risk of acute pyelonephritis? A: Men are generally at lower risk than women; however, older men and male infants have the same level of risk as older women and female infants. Male infants with genitourinary abnormalities are at higher risk than female infants. However, due to the fact that the urethral opening and anus are further apart in men than in women, there is less likelihood of bacteria being transferred from one to the other. The risk is only lower, not absent. 16 Men are advised to use condoms to reduce the risk of coming into contact with enteric bacteria that may enter the urethra, whether their partner is male or female. It may be advisable to avoid sexual activity while either partner has a UTI or kidney infection."

    "what_is_acute_stress_disorder_asd": "A person who has experienced or witnessed a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event may, in some cases, develop acute stress disorder (ASD), sometimes also called acute stress reaction. Examples of such events include: 1 2 3 4 Natural disasters, such as floods, fires or earthquakes Physical or sexual assault Car accidents Sudden death of a loved one Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis. Symptoms of ASD may include flashbacks, nightmares or intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders of the event, difficulty remembering it, dissociation, an inability to experience positive emotions, anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. These symptoms can be very distressing. A person may also experience physical symptoms such as a pounding heart, nausea and difficulty breathing. 1 4 If you think that you might have ASD, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Everyone processes traumatic experiences in their own way, and an event which does not trigger ASD in one person may trigger the condition in another. ASD seems to be more common in women than men. People who have a prior history of ASD, post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychiatric disorders, as well as people who have experienced a previous traumatic event, are also considered to be at increased risk of developing ASD. 4 A diagnosis of ASD can be made three days to one month after the traumatic event. ASD is a short-term condition, and the outlook is generally good. Many people get better on their own, without any specific treatment. However, some people may benefit from timely diagnosis and treatment – which typically comprises psychotherapy, sometimes with medication – particularly where symptoms are severe or persist. 1 2\n\nIf the symptoms of ASD persist for more than 30 days or first appear after this period, 5 a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be considered. Treatment, which is usually psychotherapy, sometimes with medication, may be recommended to help lessen the symptoms and duration of PTSD. Most people recover from PTSD; without treatment, though, this may take several months or years. In a small number of people, the condition may become chronic. 6 7 8 9 10 Not everyone who has ASD will go on to develop subsequent PTSD, and some people develop PTSD without experiencing ASD first. 11 Read more about PTSD »",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of acute stress disorder typically manifest immediately after a traumatic event. For a diagnosis of ASD to be made, they need to be present for between three and 30 days. 4 People who are affected by ASD tend to experience extreme feelings of terror and helplessness in reaction to the trauma 3 and may develop psychological and physical symptoms. The physical symptoms are typically caused by stress hormones such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and an overactivity of the nervous system. They may include: 1 Palpitations, i.e. a pounding heart Difficulty breathing Chest pain Headache Stomach pain Nausea Sweating. These symptoms usually develop within minutes or hours of the traumatic event and may clear within a few hours or days. However, in some cases the symptoms persist for weeks. Psychological symptoms of acute stress disorder include: 4 Arousal: Hypervigilance, an inability to focus, sleep disturbances, irritable mood and angry outbursts Avoidance: Determination to avoid memories, people, feelings or places associated with the trauma Dissociation: A sense of physical displacement, e.g. seeing oneself from outside one’s body, feeling dazed, experiencing an altered perception of time, difficulty remembering the event Intrusion: Recurrent, involuntary flashbacks of the event, nightmares about the event Negative mood: A generalized low mood, difficulty feeling and/or expressing positive emotions If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can try using the Ada app for a free assessment.\n\nMany of the symptoms of ASD are almost identical to those of PTSD. However, a diagnosis of PTSD will only be considered if the symptoms persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred. Though many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD , it is thought that having the former may increase a person’s risk of developing the latter. A prompt diagnosis of ASD can help people manage the condition and reduce the risk of them developing PTSD. 11 3",
    "causes": "Acute stress disorder can develop after a person, of any age, experiences or witnesses a deeply distressing or traumatic event – often one that is life-threatening or perceived as life-threatening. Examples include: 1 2 3 4 Natural disasters, such as floods, fires or earthquakes Serious accidents Physical or sexual assault, including domestic abuse Combat Terrorist attacks Sudden death of a loved one Receiving a life-threatening diagnosis Facing a seemingly impossible challenge, e.g. related to one’s job or career. Seeing a traumatic event on television or in other media is not typically considered a trigger for ASD. 4\n\nNot everyone who experiences trauma will develop ASD. A number of factors may increase the risk of a person developing the condition. These include: 4 Being female A history of trauma A history of mental health conditions The severity of the traumatic event Neurotic personality traits, e.g. experiencing the world as largely threatening, distressing and unsafe 12 Avoidance as a coping mechanism.",
    "diagnosis": "ASD can be diagnosed after symptoms have been experienced for at least three days. It is not possible to self-diagnose with ASD, as diagnosis requires an objective analysis of the symptoms of the affected person. If a person has experienced a traumatic event and thinks that they may have ASD, it is recommended that they visit a healthcare practitioner. After taking the person’s history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically diagnose acute stress disorder using the following criteria.\n\nTo diagnose ASD, a doctor may refer to the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria, the official diagnostic criteria as listed by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) . These are: 4 Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation: In addition to directly witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event, it is possible for a person to be affected by ASD if they learn that a traumatic event happened to a close relative or friend or are exposed to traumatic events as part of their job. Presenting symptoms: Of the five categories of symptoms for ASD – intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance and arousal – someone who is affected by ASD will present at least 9 of the 14 symptoms, from any of the categories. Duration of the disturbance: The symptoms of ASD must last for at least three days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. They must also manifest between at most three days and one month after the traumatic event took place. Significant distress: The symptoms are debilitating enough to impact the person’s usual way of life, such as through impaired performance at work or the inability to participate normally in social activities. Ruling out other causes: To make a diagnosis of ASD, the doctor must establish that a particular event is the root cause of the condition. They will, therefore, take care to identify any other possible causes, ruling out physical conditions, such as brain injury, or other psychological conditions. They will also consider whether the condition could be attributed to the effects of substances such as medication or alcohol.",
    "treatment": "Many people with ASD recover without any treatment. However, effective treatment options are available and may be recommended in cases where symptoms are severe or persistent. Treatment, which is primarily psychotherapy, sometimes combined with short-term use of medication, is aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing the risk of the person subsequently developing PTSD. 13 If symptoms of ASD do not improve, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered and the treatment plan revised accordingly.\n\nWhile there are many different types of psychotherapy, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) is the one recommended for the treatment of acute stress disorder. A timely course of TFCBT has been proven to reduce the likelihood of ASD developing into PTSD. 14 13 TFCBT helps people to become aware of and adjust unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma, thus aiding the recovery process. It is usually initiated no sooner than two weeks after the traumatic event, with six weekly sessions of 60 to 90 minutes. 13\n\nMedication is not a first-line treatment for ASD, and the World Health Organization generally advises against the use of sleeping pills, as well as anti-anxiety drugs in the form of benzodiazepines, in the management of the condition. 2 If recommended at all, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam will typically be used only in low doses, for the short-term relief of severe anxiety and arousal symptoms. This type of medication carries risks of dependence if used long term and may also increase the risk of developing PTSD . 2 13 Beta-blockers, a class of medication that is not addictive, may be prescribed to alleviate some of the physical symptoms of ASD. 2 Other medications, including anti-depressants, are currently not recommended for the treatment of ASD. 13",

    "acute_stress_disorder_faqs": "Q: What are the symptoms of acute stress disorder in children? A: If a child has experienced a traumatic event, it is important to monitor their behavior, as children are less likely than adults to recognize or self-report that they are experiencing symptoms of ASD. Difficulty sleeping, nightmares, repeated reenactment of the traumatic event through play, problems with concentration, detachment and irritability are all possible signs that a child is affected by ASD. If a caregiver suspects that a child may be experiencing ASD, it is recommended that they consult a health practitioner. 15 Q: How is acute stress disorder different to post-traumatic stress disorder? A: Many of the symptoms of ASD are very similar to those of PTSD, a typically longer-term condition that can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event. ASD is a short-term condition that can only be diagnosed between three days and one month after a traumatic event, and it is thought to have a somewhat broader range of triggers than PTSD. If symptoms of a stress reaction persist for more than 30 days or first appear more than one month after the trauma has occurred, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered. While many people who are diagnosed with ASD do not go on to develop PTSD, it is thought that ASD may increase a person’s risk of developing PTSD. 7 11 3 Read more about PTSD » Q: How is acute stress disorder different to adjustment disorder? A: People affected by adjustment disorder may present symptoms similar to those of people affected by ASD. However, a major difference between ASD and adjustment disorder is related to the trigger of the condition. Whereas ASD is caused by a person experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as a car crash, natural disaster or sexual assault, adjustment disorder is triggered by a more broadly stressful, life-changing event or circumstance, such as the birth of a child, job loss, diagnosis with serious illness, marriage or the breakdown of a relationship. In addition, the reaction of the body’s nervous system tends to be less severe than in ASD. People affected by adjustment disorder typically recover within six months of no longer being exposed to the stressor. 16 17 Read more about Adjustment Disorder »"

    "condition": "Acute Varicella Zoster (Chickenpox)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/acute-varicella-zoster/",
    "what_is_acute_varicella_zoster": "Varicella zoster is a virus which can cause an acute infection called chickenpox. This virus also causes shingles. It is a member of the human herpesvirus family, which is made up of eight viruses that affect humans. The varicella zoster virus is also sometimes called herpes zoster or human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3). Chickenpox is a very common disease, and occurs most commonly in childhood. It is very contagious, and outbreaks in elementary schools and kindergartens are common. About 90 percent of all cases occur in children younger than ten years old, 1 although the condition is less common than it once was due to widespread childhood vaccination.  One of the main symptoms of chickenpox is a vesicular, or blistering, rash, which is red, spotty and extremely itchy. Children with chickenpox usually get better without any specific treatment and recover well. Adults and people with a weakened immune system tend to have a more severe disease and may benefit from anti-viral treatment to help reduce the severity of the condition. These people may be more likely to suffer complications, such as pneumonia. In general, complications are rare, but can be serious. 2",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptom of chickenpox is a vesicular, or blistering, rash on the torso, scalp, face, arms and legs. This rash is often extremely itchy. The spots generally become crusting sores. There may also be blisters or sores inside the mouth and nose. The rash is often extremely itchy. Teenagers and adults may experience flu-like symptoms before the chickenpox rash appears. Good to know: People with chickenpox are infectious one to two days before the development of the rash. People who have contracted chickenpox may experience flu-like symptoms before the chickenpox rash appears.\n\nMost cases of chickenpox occur among children, who may contract the virus from friends, schoolmates or caregivers. Symptoms include: 3 4 Fever, usually moderate, rising to about 39 C / 102.2 F Headache Body aches Loss of appetite Rash Not all children will experience severe symptoms or feel particularly ill. Some children may remain playful and be only mildly uncomfortable, while others may feel rather unwell. Diarrhea and vomiting, sensitivity to light and high fever are not typical symptoms of chickenpox and may indicate measles, another childhood condition characterized by a rash. If you, your child or someone you care for is experiencing troubling symptoms, you can use the free Ada app to do a symptom assessment at any time.\n\nChickenpox symptoms in adults are similar to those in children and include: 3 4 Fever Headache Body aches Loss of appetite and nausea Rash Fever, headache and body aches are sometimes described as a prodrome or a set of symptoms indicating that a condition is developing. The prodromal symptoms of fever, headache and body pain are usually more pronounced in adults. 4 Good to know: While children may go through chickenpox feeling mildly uncomfortable, teenagers and adults with the condition often feel very ill and may have to take time off work or school.\n\nThe rash that is characteristic of chickenpox usually manifests as small red spots, which are itchy. It is important not to scratch the rash, as this may lead to secondary infection as well as scarring. There are three stages of the chickenpox rash: 4 5 Stage one: Raised, red or pink bumps that appear over several days Stage two: Over the course of a day, the bumps give rise to fluid-filled blisters, which break and leak Stage three: The blisters crust and heal, which takes several days It is usual to have different stages of the rash present on the body at the same time. This is one of the features that helps examining doctors to identify the rash as that caused by chickenpox. The rash can affect the torso and sometimes also the arms and legs. It can also affect the scalp and the mouth. In the mouth, the rash may form aphthous mouth ulcers . 4 Good to know: A person with chickenpox will be contagious for two days before the rash appears and until all of the lesions have crusted over. To avoid spreading the infection to others, children should not attend school or adults attend work until their rash has completely crusted over. If the rash spreads to the eyes or becomes warm, begins to weep and/or begins to feel tender, urgent medical care should be sought, as these symptoms indicate that a secondary skin infection may have set in. Furthermore, if anyone with chickenpox experiences nausea, dizziness, fast heartbeat or other possible symptoms of sepsis , they should go to a hospital as a matter of urgency. 5",
    "causes_and_risk_factors": "The varicella zoster virus , like most members of the herpesvirus family, is extremely contagious. The varicella zoster virus is spread through breathing, coughing and sneezing, as well as by touching the rash of someone with chickenpox. 1 Unvaccinated children between the ages of 4 and 10 are most likely to catch chickenpox. The condition tends to be more serious in adolescents and adults than it is in children. Like all members of the herpesvirus family, the varicella zoster virus goes dormant once the acute infection is over. It can be reactivated later, and when that happens, the condition is known as shingles. Read more about Shingles »",

Testing fluid from the blistering rash for the varicella zoster virus can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe rash that appears in cases of acute varicella zoster is distinctive, and often, this alone is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis. However, doctors examining someone with a suspected case of chickenpox may also ask whether the affected person has recently had contact with a family member with chickenpox, whether there has been an outbreak of chickenpox at their kindergarten, school or workplace and whether they have been vaccinated against the virus.\n\nMost of the time, because the rash of chickenpox is so distinctive, laboratory tests are not needed to confirm a diagnosis. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to use laboratory tests to determine whether some has, or has had, an acute varicella zoster infection. Such situations include: 6 To find out if someone who has not been vaccinated has had chickenpox and is immune To determine whether someone who is going to undergo immunosuppressive therapy of some kind, such as chemotherapy, may experience a reactivation of the virus To confirm suspected varicella in cases where symptoms are atypical or severe, or where complications are present To be doubly sure that the affected person’s symptoms are being caused by varicella rather than another condition To confirm that an outbreak has been caused by varicella Unvaccinated people and pregnant people may be tested for varicella more often than people with a known history of vaccination or recent contact with someone with chickenpox. Tests for varicella take two forms: 6 Tests for antibodies against the virus, in which a blood sample is tested Tests for the virus itself, which can be done using blood, tissue, cerebrospinal fluid or a scraping from the rash Antibody tests are often done to establish whether someone at risk of complications, such as a newborn, a pregnant person or someone with a weakened immune system, is immune to the varicella zoster virus. Tests for the virus itself are usually done when someone who is at risk of complications has been exposed to chickenpox or shingles, and has subsequently become ill. 6 Viral tests can also be used to determine which strain of the virus is causing individual illnesses or an outbreak.",
    "treatment_for_chickenpox": "Generally, no specific treatment is recommended for children with chickenpox. Lotions, such as calamine lotion, to help reduce itching might be helpful, while adults can also use antihistamine tablets. 7 Oatmeal baths and wet compresses may also help relieve the itching. Pain and fever should be managed with paracetamol. Aspirin should not be used to treat pain and/or fever in children. Adults, people with weakened immune systems and people who develop complications are often prescribed antiviral medication such as aciclovir. It is important to begin treatment within 24 hours if it is to be most effective. 4 Pregnant women who are exposed to chickenpox typically also need treatment, and should discuss this with their doctor as a matter of urgency.",
    "complications": "Most cases of chickenpox clear up without complications. However, complications can sometimes occur. They are more likely to occur among unvaccinated children, babies, adolescents and adults, as well as people of any age who are immunosuppressed. Possible complications of chickenpox include: 4 5 7 Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain Pneumonia Otitis media Secondary bacterial infections, especially of the skin Reye syndrome Hepatitis, inflammation of the liver\n\nAlthough rare, affecting about one out of every thousand people with chickenpox, encephalitis can be life-threatening if not treated. The condition results from direct viral infection of the brain. Symptoms include: 8 Headache Fever Disorientation Altered mental states, such as aggression and/or confusion Seizures Focal neurological deficits, such as difficulty walking, uncontrolled eye movements, paralysis, loss of reflexes or loss of the ability to express oneself, read or write Ataxia Ataxia is the loss of the ability to control voluntary muscle movements and affects proprioception, the sense of where one’s limbs are and where they are in relation to one another, the rest of the body and the environment. Ataxia may cause difficulty with speaking, walking, moving, coordination, swallowing, eye movement and balance. 9 10\n\nA rare complication of chickenpox in children, the risk of Reye syndrome increases if aspirin is used to treat the child’s pain or fever. Reye syndrome can occur independently of the condition that caused the fever. It can occur after flu, the common cold, infectious mononucleosis or a number of other viral infections that cause fevers, but is not caused by these conditions. It affects the child’s brain and liver. Symptoms include: 11 12 Vomiting Tiredness and sleepiness Irritability and/or aggression Diarrhea Rapid breathing Seizures Delirium Not all children with Reye syndrome will show all of these symptoms. The condition is not well-understood, but it is a medical emergency. There is no cure, but early, aggressive therapy is given to treat the symptoms and support the body. 11 If you are concerned that a child you care for may be ill, or that you or someone else you care for is ill, you can assess symptoms using the free Ada app at any time.\n\nBecause many people today have either had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it, most pregnant people who come into contact with someone who has chickenpox will already be immune to the condition. In these cases, they should notify their doctor that they have had contact with chickenpox, but generally no ill-effects will occur. However, if the pregnant person has not had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it, they should contact their doctor without delay, as developing chickenpox during pregnancy can cause complications, affecting both the parent and the baby. Affected adults in this situation may develop liver inflammation, pneumonia or encephalitis, while newborns and young infants may develop neonatal varicella, shingles or congenital varicella syndrome.\n\nIf a pregnant person develops chickenpox within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, their baby may develop a very rare condition called congenital varicella syndrome (CVS). Mothers who contract varicella during pregnancy can pass it on to their unborn babies, but again, this is rare, only occurring in about two in every hundred cases where babies are exposed to varicella during early pregnancy. 13 The condition can be monitored before birth using ultrasound scans. Babies with congenital varicella syndrome may show the following signs and symptoms: 13 14 Low birth weight and premature birth A smaller-than-average head, known as microcephaly Thickened, inflamed skin Underdeveloped or malformed limbs Eye disorders such as cataracts , inflammation and involuntary eye movements Smaller-than-average eyes, known as microphthalmia Later in life, intellectual and learning disabilities may become evident. Children with congenital varicella syndrome may have difficulty with psychomotor skills or with involuntary muscle movements. Children with CVS are at increased risk of developing shingles in early childhood. 14 If you or someone you care for is pregnant and may be ill, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app ?\n\nIf a baby is exposed to the varicella virus shortly before or after birth via contact with a sibling, parent or caregiver with chickenpox or shingles, they may develop shingles very early in life. 15 Shingles is otherwise rare among children. The outlook is usually good, and the condition is often milder in children than in adults. 16 Most children with shingles do not need to be hospitalized or treated with antiviral medications, except in cases where the rash is very severe, or the eyes are affected. 15\n\nIf a pregnant person contracts varicella during the last three weeks of pregnancy, the baby may develop neonatal varicella. The condition can also be contracted in the days following birth, usually from the mother, but occasionally from other family members or visitors. This condition tends to be severe because the babies affected have very immature immune systems and no immunity to varicella, 17 and so they must be monitored. Neonatal varicella is particularly severe and can be fatal to the newborn in cases, where the baby’s mother develops the chickenpox rash between five days before birth and two days afterwards. Cases where the mother develops the rash four or more days after birth tend to be milder. This condition is treated with the antiviral drug acyclovir. 18",
    "preventing_chickenpox": "Vaccination against the varicella zoster virus is part of the regular vaccination schedule in many parts of the world. Keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule can prevent many cases of chickenpox. Adults who have never had chickenpox, and who have never been vaccinated against chickenpox should consider vaccination, especially if they work or live with children. 19 People who have never had chickenpox should consider vaccination before trying to become pregnant. Good to know: It is possible for people who have been vaccinated to get chickenpox. This is known as breakthrough chickenpox and is generally much milder than the condition would be in a completely unvaccinated person. 20\n\nIn the U.S. and many other countries, there are two ways to vaccinate against chickenpox, as there are two vaccines that can confer immunity against chickenpox. These are the MMRV vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine.\n\nThe MMRV vaccine is intended to protect against measles , mumps , rubella and chickenpox. In the U.S., children usually receive two doses of this vaccine: 21 Between the ages of 12 and 15 months Between the ages of four and six years In some instances, especially during mumps outbreaks, a third dose of MMRV may be administered.In some other countries, for example Australia, children between the ages of 12 and 15 months will be given an MMR, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, rather than an MMRV vaccine. This is meant to reduce the likelihood of febrile seizures , which can occur after MMRV vaccination in children of that age. In these cases, the MMR vaccine will be given between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the MMRV vaccine will be administered at 18 months of age. 20 People aged 13 and over will not usually be given the MMRV vaccine, but rather separate MMR and chickenpox vaccines. 20 21\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine can also be administered on its own. Typically, children who are receiving this vaccine rather than the MMRV will receive two doses, the first between the ages of 12 and 15 months of age and the second between the ages of 4 and 6 years. 19 People aged 13 or older should also receive two doses of the chickenpox vaccine, 28 days apart.\n\nNot all children can be be vaccinated. Criteria that make some people unsuited to vaccination include: 19 22 23 On the day of the vaccination: Feeling unwell Having recently received a blood transfusion or organ transplant In general: A history of allergic reactions to vaccinations Pregnancy Conditions such as cancer or leukemia Immunosuppression, such as might be caused by HIV or chemotherapy Taking immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids Some people may experience mild discomfort after being vaccinated, but this will almost always go away quickly. Some people may develop a low-grade fever or a mild rash, or feel some pain at the site of the vaccination. 22 Good to know: There is no scientific evidence that vaccines of any kind are related to or cause autism . All evidence shows that this is not the case. 24 25 26 Avoiding vaccinations because of concerns about autism can increase the risk of serious infections in oneself and others.\n\nSome people, especially those who are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised, cannot receive the live varicella vaccine. However, they may receive a varicella zoster immune globulin preparation (VZIG). Groups that should receive this treatment rather than the typical chickenpox vaccine after exposure to VZV include: Immunocompromised or immunosuppressed adults and children Pregnant women Newborns with mothers who developed varicella shortly before or after delivery Infants born prematurely Babies of less than one year of age Adults who have never had chickenpox or been vaccinated against it Good to know: VZIG cannot stop the condition, but can reduce its severity.",
    "other_names_for_acute_varicella_zoster": "Chickenpox, sometimes written as chicken pox Varicella Varicella zoster infection",
    "chickenpox_faqs": "Q: Is chickenpox related to measles? A: No. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus, a member of the human herpesvirus family. Measles is caused by the measles morbillivirus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. Both diseases cause a rash, and the MMRV vaccine can protect against both chickenpox and measles as well as mumps and rubella, but the conditions are not related. Measles tends to be a more severe illness. Q: What is the difference between the measles rash and the chickenpox rash? A: Both the measles rash and the chickenpox rash are generally described as red in color. However, there are some differences in their appearance and spread across the body. The chickenpox rash: Is blister-like Is not as dark as the measles rash Starts on the head and trunk and spreads to the limbs Appears in clusters Is small, red, and itchy Blisters develop on top of spots Blisters dry out and crust over The measles rash: Is red-brown in color Appears as flat red spots, which can be itchy, but are not blistered or crusty Begins behind the ears or at the hairline Spreads to the head and neck Then spreads to trunk, limbs and feet Spots may join together as the rash spreads In addition, people with measles usually develop spots in the mouth and throat. These are tiny white spots, known as Koplik’s spots. You can use the free Ada app to help assess the symptoms of measles, chickenpox and many other common childhood conditions. Q: How can pregnant people decrease the risk of chickenpox during pregnancy? A: If a pregnant person has already had chickenpox or has been vaccinated against chickenpox, they should be at low risk of developing the condition. However, caution is always advised. People, who are pregnant or plan on getting pregnant, who have not been vaccinated or who have not had chickenpox, should consult a doctor. They may be advised to try and avoid contact with anyone with the condition and confirm that everyone they live with has been vaccinated. People who are already pregnant should not be vaccinated against chickenpox. The vaccine contains live strains of the virus. However, people can be vaccinated up to a month before falling pregnant or after delivery. 13 Q: Can chickenpox leave scars? A: The rash of chickenpox usually goes away and leaves no sign. However, if the rash is badly scratched and/or becomes infected, it may scar. Parents/caregivers should be sure to trim or clip the fingernails of any children with an itchy varicella rash, as this will decrease the chance of scratching leading to secondary bacterial infections and/or scarring. Q: Can chickenpox be fatal? A: Most people with chickenpox recover completely, but if complications develop, the condition can become very serious and, in rare cases, fatal. Newborns, unvaccinated children, pregnant people and people with weakened immune systems are at particular risk of potentially life-threateningcomplications such as pneumonia and encephalitis. Q: Can chickenpox cause cancer? A: No link between chickenpox and cancer has been established. 27 Some studies suggest that having chickenpox may give some protection against developing brain cancer later in life, 28 but this is not yet proven, and research into the relationship between chickenpox and other conditions is ongoing."

    "condition": "Adjustment Disorder",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/adjustment-disorder/",
    "what_is_adjustment_disorder": "Adjustment disorder is sometimes referred to as situational depression . Unlike regular depression, the cause(s) of which may be ongoing and/or unspecified, adjustment disorder is an abnormal emotional and/or behavioral response to stressors which are present in a particular period of a person’s life, often surrounding a major life event. For example, a person may experience stressors that give rise to adjustment disorder after a major life change, such as a breakup, divorce, marriage, having a baby or moving house, or after an unfortunate event which involves stress, such as a car accident. It is also possible to develop the condition following a career change or break, especially one which alters a person’s daily environment or routine, such as discharge from military service or becoming unemployed. Symptoms of adjustment disorder or situational depression include: Psychological symptoms associated with depression, such as a depressed mood and hopelessness. These can result in behaviours such as social withdrawal and introversion, but can also, less commonly, lead to irritable mood, aggressive behavior or acting out. Psychological symptoms associated with anxiety, such as nervousness and worry. These symptoms will normally begin within three months of the onset of the stressor; for example, after moving home; and last for no longer than six months after the stressor or event has ended. 1 Adjustment disorder is most common in children and adolescents, but adults may often also develop the condition. The treatment goal for adjustment disorder is to relieve the symptoms. A typical treatment programme for adjustment disorder will normally feature a course of talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or group therapy and may include prescription medications and prescribed exercise. 2 3 If you think you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of adjustment disorder, try the Ada app for a free health assessment.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of adjustment disorder will usually appear within three months of the stressful event or life change and disappear within six months. Most commonly, adjustment disorder which does not resolve after six months may develop into depression. Generally, the symptoms of adjustment disorder will significantly interfere with the functioning of a person's life, for example by making it difficult to socialize, work or attend school. Symptoms of adjustment disorder may vary according to the age of the person experiencing the condition. Children and adolescents may be more likely to display behavioral symptoms, such as acting out, school problems and sleep disturbances, whereas adults often tend to experience more emotional symptoms, such as anxiety and a depressed mood. 4 5",
    "symptoms_2": "6 subtypes of adjustment disorder can be found according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders by the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5). 5 6\n\nSymptoms of adjustment disorder with depressed mood may include feelings of depression, sadness and hopelessness. People who are affected may also be highly tearful and experience frequent bouts of crying.\n\nSymptoms of adjustment disorder with anxiety may include feelings of nervousness, apprehension and worry. People may also be excessively jittery and fearful of separation, from parents or other significant people.\n\nA person who is affected by adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood will experience a mixture of the symptoms of adjustment disorder with anxiety and those of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. People with this form of the condition may be affected by different symptoms or combinations of symptoms.\n\nA person who is affected by adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct will experience a change in behavior . This is typically characterized by: A lack of respect for the rights and feelings of others A lack of respect for social norms and rules\n\nA person affected by adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct may experience a combination of the possible symptoms of adjustment disorder with depressed mood, anxiety or disturbance of conduct.\n\nIn the case of adjustment disorder unspecified, a person experiences a severe reaction to a stressor, but it does not fit into any of the above categories.",
    "causes": "Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a particular stressor, whether a stressful life event or a major life change. In both children and adults, adjustment disorder can be caused by any event which feels greatly significant to the particular person, regardless of whether or not this event appears significant to others. 7 Common stressors that may lead to adjustment disorder in a person of any age include: 8 Giving birth Marriage Unemployment Retirement Divorce or relationship problems Illness and health issues Moving to a new house or new location Financial difficulties The death of a loved one Common stressors that may affect a child or young adult include: Parental divorce or separation Moving to a new house, neighborhood or new town Problems at school, such as not being able to keep up with demands from school, changing schools or not being able to connect with peers Health issues and/or sexuality issues, i.e. uncertainties related to sexual orientation Death of a close relative or friend",
    "adjustment_disorder_risk_factors": "There is no clear way to identify why some people develop adjustment disorder in response to a given stressor and why others do not. Factors, such as a person’s coping skills, past experiences and social skills are among many others, all thought to play a role. A person is at greater risk of experiencing adjustment disorder than the general population if they meet any one or more of the following criteria: 9 8 10 Being female Being affected by other psychological conditions Experiencing long-term stressors , such as financial strain, a long-term illness, having an illicit love affair or domestic problems Lacking a social support system Having experienced certain types of stress during childhood , including sexual or physical abuse, other traumatic events, frequent house moves or overprotective parenting Being single Being at a low educational level Living in an urban area",
    "diagnosing_adjustment_disorder": "A diagnosis of adjustment disorder usually requires a full psychological evaluation by a psychiatrist or other mental health professional. This evaluation will typically take into account past experiences, behaviors, emotions and sources of stress, among other factors. When diagnosing children or adolescents, parents may also be present during the evaluation. 11 The key diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder are: The symptoms must have begun to appear within three months of the stressor occurring The condition must be characterized by stress that is in excess of what would be considered normal under the circumstances and which leads to significant impairment of a person’s personal life, social functioning, their work or school performance and/or attendance The symptoms must be distinct from similar disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n\nAlthough adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can have overlapping symptoms, the key difference between the two conditions is their cause. Adjustment disorder is typically triggered by a stressful event or phase, but one that is within the normal everyday range of human experience, such as a marriage breakup or financial difficulty. Conversely, PTSD is caused by an exceptional, traumatic event. This is normally one involving the threat of death, serious injury or violence to oneself, or an event which involves witnessing the same happening to a very close or loved person. Experiencing this severe threat causes retrospective feelings of extreme fear, horror and helplessness. PTSD can also be a long-term condition that may not present itself until several months or years after the initial event. Adjustment disorder, on the other hand, must present itself within three months of the triggering event. 13\n\nAdjustment disorder – especially the depressed mood subtype – and depression are similar conditions. To properly differentiate them, a thorough evaluation by a medical professional is needed. One major, generally accepted difference between the two conditions is that adjustment disorder is triggered by an identifiable stressful event or phase, and this will be clear-cut and easy to pinpoint. In contrast, when depression develops, the exact causes of the condition or the current depressive episode are often unclear. Adjustment disorder will also generally be a more short-term condition. However, the same time frame could apply to a depressive episode, which makes it all the more important that a person undergoes a proper medical evaluation and receives an accurate diagnosis. Good to know: If a person who has been diagnosed with adjustment disorder (AD) continues to experience mental distress after six months , it is likely that the AD has developed into another mental health condition, most often depression. In this event, a new diagnosis will be considered. Other conditions developing from AD are usually anticipated to be longer-lasting and to require ongoing treatment. 14 15 If you think that you, or a loved one, may be affected by depression or another mental health condition, you may begin a free symptom assessment with Ada .",
    "treating_adjustment_disorder": "The chosen treatment method for adjustment disorder will usually depend on a variety of factors, including: 16 Age Severity of symptoms The subtype being experienced Specific factors contributing to the development or worsening of the condition Taking these factors into consideration, a psychiatrist or other mental health professional will recommend a treatment route. 17 18\n\nIndividual psychotherapy may take a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach, particularly in the U.K., buy in the U.S., other kinds of talk therapy may often be recommended, too. Because the condition is defined as short-term, this will typically be solution-focussed, short course of psychotherapy. The treatment goal is to equip the affected person to understand how to overcome adjustment disorder by teaching them techniques for dealing more effectively with their particular problem and its effects on their life.\n\nFamily therapy will generally be recommended in cases of childhood or adolescent adjustment disorder. It is designed to overcome conflicts in family life and improve communication skills among family members. It may also be useful in teaching family members how to support the child/adolescent who is experiencing adjustment disorder.\n\nIn some cases, sharing challenge and coping techniques with a group of people also experiencing the condition can equip a person to understand how to overcome adjustment disorder in a practical sense and to apply this to their own life. Group therapy can also help the person improve their communication skills and can be a useful source of support and encouragement. 19\n\nAlthough supportive, solution-oriented psychotherapy is the first-line treatment for adjustment disorder, medications are sometimes additionally prescribed. 20 When medications are prescribed, they are used in order to treat specific symptoms of adjustment disorder ‒ for example, if a person is sleeping badly, is experiencing nerves or anxiety most of the time or is excessively depressed. 8 It is for this reason that medications are usually only prescribed in severe cases, are carefully evaluated by a person’s medical care team and are most likely an adjunct to rather than a replacement for talk therapy, which targets the condition’s root cause. 21 Medications which may be used in the treatment of adjustment disorder include: 8 20 21 Antidepressants. These will usually only be prescribed if depressive symptoms are still having a major impact on a person’s life three months after beginning non-medication-based treatment for adjustment disorder. Benzodiazepines. These medications may help alleviate anxiety and problems sleeping in the short-term. However, they are not recommended for long-term use due to their addictive potential and should only be prescribed and taken after careful evaluation by a doctor. Good to know: There are some herbal remedies which are being investigated for their potential effects on adjustment disorder symptoms, especially those of anxiety and insomnia. These particular herbal remedies include extracts of passiflora and valerian. However, overall, these substances have not been sufficiently scientifically researched and evaluated for their safety and efficacy to be generally recommended. Always consult a doctor before using any type of herbal preparation, as they may not be safe for particular people or in combination with certain medications. 20",

    "adjustment_disorder_faqs": "Q: What happens if adjustment disorder lasts longer than six months? A: The time frame of adjustment disorder is variable. The condition <em>usually</em> develops some time after a stressful life event and gets better within six months of the stressor ending. 22 While this is the time frame referred to in most diagnostic manuals, others accept that some of the symptoms may persist longer, especially if the condition is caused by an ongoing stressor. Therefore, it is important to note that a person may be affected by the condition for longer than the usual time frame if the causal stressor is chronic, i.e. has long-term consequences or is itself long-lasting, for example unemployment or a severe, long lasting medical condition. 23 Adjustment disorder which is longer-lasting than usual is sometimes referred to as chronic adjustment disorder. Q: Am I entitled to compensation if I need to take time off work due to adjustment disorder? A: People who experience adjustment disorder and are in a paid position may be entitled to paid sick leave ‒ a kind of compensation ‒ if their condition is severe enough to warrant time off work for them to get better medically. Q: Is there a diagnostic test for adjustment disorder? A: Although various diagnostic questionnaires have been developed and trialed as possible screening tools for detecting adjustment disorder, i.e. the Adjustment Disorder New Module 20 Questionnaire , the idea of using a diagnostic test is not universally-accepted as a necessary part of the diagnostic process. Currently, the condition is usually diagnosed by considering the symptoms themselves, their timeline and the specific cause(s) of a person’s symptoms."

The amount of alcohol needed for intoxication varies from person to person. Due to the wide availability of alcoholic beverages, acute intoxication is quite common – affecting almost 10 percent of adults in the United States alone, leading to an estimated annual economic cost of over $250 billion. 1 The signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication result in alterations in a person's consciousness, cognition, perception, judgment, affect, or behavior. These can vary between people and depend on the severity of intoxication. Not only the effects of alcohol but also the complications caused by it – such as accidents and violence – are a major threat to a person’s health. Diagnosis of alcohol intoxication always requires ruling out other conditions. In moderate and severe cases, measuring the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is essential. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and avoiding complications. Management and prognosis also vary depending on the degree of intoxication.

For some people, the threshold lies far below that. Risk increases the higher the percentage of alcohol is in the beverage. Rate of alcohol intake affects the body’s ability to cope: The faster alcohol is ingested, the higher the risk of intoxication. Children and old people have a reduced ability to eliminate alcohol: Children are particularly at risk of accidentally ingesting alcohol found in colognes, perfumes, mouthwash, aftershave, or cough medication. Previous food intake and hydration level influence the effects of alcohol. Higher body weight increases the ability to eliminate alcohol. This makes women on average more susceptible. Underlying conditions, which can reduce the ability to eliminate alcohol. Certain medications can reduce the ability to eliminate alcohol. Frequency and pattern of alcohol use can influence the resistance or susceptibility to the effects of alcohol Symptoms in frequent drinkers can be less predictable and sometimes less showing.

Physical examination: Doing a complete physical examination on the affected person in order to: Recognize any signs of alcohol intoxication Pick up on other conditions causing similar symptoms Notice potential complications (see below) Measuring the alcohol concentration blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the most accurate measurement of the alcohol level. Particularly in regular drinkers, symptoms and the BAC do not necessarily relate to each other, making an accurate measurement beneficial. Usually, this is only required in moderate and severe cases. Breath analysis Is an available alternative Provides more rapid results Requires cooperation Is less accurate. Additional studies are usually unnecessary in cases of mild alcohol intoxication. They should include: Other laboratory studies, such as glucose and electrolyte levels, in addition to the BAC Imaging tests, such as X-rays or CT scans, if there are signs of an accident. It is essential to rule out other conditions in order to diagnose alcohol intoxication. These include: 1 , 3 Head trauma This can also occur as a result of alcohol intoxication due to falling.

    "what_is_alcohol_withdrawal": "Alcohol withdrawal is a term used to describe the symptoms that occur after an individual suddenly stops drinking after prolonged and heavy exposure to alcohol. The condition is also termed alcohol withdrawal syndrome. People who experience alcohol withdrawal often live with a chronic alcohol use disorder, which is sometimes referred to as alcohol abuse or dependency. Roughly every second person living with an alcohol use disorder will develop symptoms due to alcohol withdrawal when drinking is strongly reduced or stopped. If symptoms occur, this usually happens between 6 to 24 hours after the last drink or when a strong reduction in drinking took place.\n\nFor most people with alcohol withdrawal, symptoms tend to be mild and include anxiety, restlessness, headaches, and a craving for alcohol. However, in about every fifth person with alcohol withdrawal, symptoms are more severe and may include hallucinosis, seizures, or even delirium. There is a fixed set of criteria on which making the diagnosis is based. This requires a thorough medical history and physical examination. Other tests will be performed in order to evaluate the alcohol use disorder and check for complications. Treatment includes tranquilizers and close monitoring of the affected person. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8",
    "what_causes_alcohol_withdrawal": "Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are caused by stopping or strongly reducing alcohol consumption in a person living with a chronic alcohol use disorder. The latter is known to be caused by a combination of genetic, psychological, and social factors. Generally, alcohol decreases the brain’s overall activity. If a person drinks large amounts of alcohol regularly, this can eventually result in a new balance between activating and inhibiting nerve pathways. If regular alcohol consumption then gets interrupted, overactivity is caused. This results in the typical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. 1 , 6 , 7 However, only about every second person living with an alcohol use disorder will develop symptoms due to alcohol withdrawal when drinking is strongly reduced or stopped. Factors that make this more likely include: 1 Number of drinks consumed on each occasion Number of alcohol-related problems present The extent of the physiologic dependence- How strongly the body has adjusted to and thus requires alcohol No more than 24 hours have passed since the last drink Genes may play a role in the risk for developing alcohol withdrawal, as well as in its severity. However, this is still being researched. 1",

Admission to an intensive care unit can be considered in people: Over the age of 40 With coexisting conditions With a history of complicated withdrawals Who do not react well to treatment Who have unstable vital signs Who have severe metabolic derangements Who have other complications Metabolic derangements should be corrected. Intravenous fluids: This is necessary in all people with alcohol withdrawal. Fluids are given via an intravenous access. Nutritional supplementation: This should initially be done via an intravenous access because   gastrointestinal absorption is reduced, and the person is at risk of vomit entering the airways and suffocating.Includes administration of: Thiamine (vitamin B1) Glucose Folate Multivitamins Safe environment: This should be a quiet and protective place. In people with withdrawal delirium, temporary physical restraint may become necessary in order to prevent them from harming themselves and others. Any mechanical restraint should be removed as soon as sedation medication starts to work. Medication: Benzodiazepines is necessary in all people with alcohol withdrawal in order to treat their agitation and to avoid complications. The treatment will work as a sedative and decrease the person’s neuronal overactivity.Benzodiazepines should never be taken long-term because of the high risk of getting addicted.",

    "what_is_allergic_conjunctivitis": "Conjunctivitis is the name for  inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids and which covers the white part of the eye. Also known as pink eye , conjunctivitis is often caused by bacteria (see bacterial conjunctivitis ), a virus (see viral conjunctivitis ), or allergens, for example seasonal pollen, dust or animal dander. When pink eye is caused by allergies , it is called allergic conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, allergic conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious. 1 2 3 Allergic conjunctivitis usually affects both eyes. The main symptoms include: 1 2 3 Pinkness or redness of the eyes Burning, intense itching or a sensation of grittiness in the eyes Watering of the eyes Swollen and/or reddened eyelids Other symptoms of allergy, e.g. itchy nose, sneezing and scratchy throat Many cases of mild allergic conjunctivitis clear up on their own, without specific treatment, when contact with the causal allergen is minimized or avoided. Applying cool compresses to the eyes and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, which are available over the counter, may help to relieve symptoms. However, allergy medications, such as antihistamine tablets and prescription eye drops, may be recommended, particularly for more severe cases of allergic conjunctivitis. 1 2 3 Generally, people make a complete recovery and the condition does not cause any complications. However, in rare cases, allergic conjunctivitis can be very serious and may cause damage to a person’s vision if left untreated. 3 4 Anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include: 5 6 4 Intense pain in the eye Extreme redness in the eye Inability to open the eye Severe sensitivity to light Difficulty seeing Spots or blisters developing near the eye, on the eyelid or nose Furthermore, if symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought. Allergic conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, though it is particularly common in young adults and people with a history of allergic conditions, such as eczema , hay fever , allergic rhinitis and asthma . 7 8 Symptoms may be present for short periods of time, e.g. seasonally, when the allergen is a type of seasonal pollen, or throughout the year, e.g. when the allergen is dust or dander. 9 Allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious, which means that it cannot be passed from one person to another. 2\n\nFeeling unwell?

    "symptoms": "Generally, allergic conjunctivitis is bilateral, meaning that it affects both eyes. Symptoms tend to develop quickly, and one eye may be more severely affected than the other. Rubbing the eyes may make symptoms worse. Symptoms include: 1 2 3 4 9 Pinkness or redness of the eyes Burning, intense itching or a sensation of grittiness in the eyes Watering of the eyes; the discharge is clear Swollen eyelids, which are red on the inside Slight sensitivity to bright light Other symptoms of allergy, e.g. itchy nose, sneezing and scratchy throat Depending on the cause and type of allergic conjunctivitis, there may be other symptoms and signs. If you think that you may have allergic conjunctivitis, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Pain is not typically a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. If it does occur, it tends to be mild. Furthermore, a person’s vision is not usually affected. Severe eye pain may indicate another, more serious condition such as glaucoma , and, if present, medical attention should be sought promptly. If any symptoms affecting the eyes are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay.",
    "causes": "A person’s immune system may be sensitive and react to certain substances such as pollen or molds. These are called allergens and, if they enter the eye, allergic conjunctivitis can result. 4 9 The most common causes of allergic conjunctivitis are the following types of allergens: 1 4 9 Pollens, including grass, tree and other plant pollens Molds Dust mites Animal dander, e.g. pet fur Less common causes of allergic reactions include contact lenses, makeup, eye drops and other substances used in or near the eyes.",
    "types": "Depending on the timing, frequency and cause of the allergic conjunctivitis, it may be classified as one of the following: 3 4 9 8 10\n\nSeasonal allergic conjunctivitis tends to cause mild symptoms for a few weeks, or sometimes a few months, around the same time every year. This is generally caused by pollen and often coincides with hay fever seasons.\n\nPerennial allergic conjunctivitis tends to cause mild symptoms throughout the year; this is caused by allergens that are always present in a particular environment, most often the person’s home, such as dust mites, molds or animal dander. Symptoms are typically worse upon waking in the morning.\n\nAcute allergic conjunctivitis tends to develop suddenly upon exposure to an allergen, such as animal fur; this can cause fairly severe symptoms, but usually resolves quickly after preventing further exposure to the allergen.\n\nContact conjunctivitis is an allergic reaction caused by a sensitivity to makeup, eye drops, creams or lotions, or other substances used in or near the eyes. It can also affect the outside of the eyelids and is called contact dermatoconjunctivitis in these cases.\n\nGiant papillary conjunctivitis is an inflammation caused by a reaction to an object in the eye, most often a contact lens. It sometimes also occurs after eye surgery.\n\nVernal keratoconjunctivitis is an uncommon inflammatory condition that mostly affects young people, particularly boys, in warm weather conditions. It may be seasonal or perennial (year-round), with symptoms tending to be worse during spring. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis can cause: Severe itching Severe sensitivity to light Cobblestone-like bumps on the conjunctiva Thick, ropy mucus discharge If left untreated, vernal keratoconjunctivitis may lead to scarring of the eyes and long-term vision problems.\n\nAtopic keratoconjunctivitis is a rare inflammatory condition that mostly affects young adults who have atopic dermatitis (eczema). It can last for a number of years, potentially causing serious damage to a person’s vision if left untreated. Symptoms include: Itching Redness Sensitivity to light Blurry vision Eyelids may be thick, red and scaly",
    "conjunctivitis_caused_by_irritants": "Conjunctivitis can also be caused by irritation from a variety of substances as opposed to an allergic reaction. These include: 1 2 4 11 12 Foreign objects in the eyes Cosmetics and soaps Chemicals, e.g. household cleaning products, chlorine in swimming pools Smoke and fumes Dust and dirt Mild cases of irritant-related conjunctivitis can generally be treated by removing or avoiding the substance, flushing the eyes with water and applying cold compresses and lubricating eye drops to the eyes. However, more serious cases may require specialist medical treatment. If symptoms are severe or the irritant is a toxic substance, e.g. a household cleaning product, medical attention should be sought urgently.",
    "diagnosis": "When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the eye condition or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important. A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether they have any allergies. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out acute viral conjunctivitis , bacterial conjunctivitis , dry eye syndrome and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis and keratitis. 2 13 In most cases, it will not be necessary to perform any special tests. However, in some cases a doctor will order allergy tests, e.g. skin patch tests, to identify allergens and confirm the diagnosis. 3",
    "allergic_conjunctivitis_treatment": "Mild cases of allergic conjunctivitis often clear up when exposure to the allergen is reduced, without special medical treatment. In more serious or long-lasting cases, medication may be necessary to treat the condition.\n\nThe following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis: 1 3 Taking steps to minimize contact with the allergen Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears  to the eye; these are available without a prescription Applying a cold compress to the eye, i.e. a clean cloth that has been soaked in water Avoiding rubbing the eyes Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the conjunctivitis has cleared Avoiding the use of eye makeup until the conjunctivitis has cleared A person with perennial allergic conjunctivitis may wish to consult an allergy specialist to identify the cause of their allergic condition and devise an approach to minimize exposure. 9\n\nWhen allergic conjunctivitis is more serious or does not clear up, medication may be recommended to calm the allergic reaction, provide relief from symptoms and prevent eye complications. Medication may include: 4 9\n\nEye drops for allergic conjunctivitis are generally available over the counter for short-term daily use of two weeks or less, or with a prescription for longer-term use. The types of eye drops recommended for allergic conjunctivitis typically contain antihistamines or mast cell stabilizers. Both histamines and mast cells are involved in an allergic reaction; antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers function to reduce their effects and thereby the severity of the reaction.\n\nAntihistamine tablets are sometimes recommended for allergic conjunctivitis. They can also help to alleviate other symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as a runny nose caused by hay fever. Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, so they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\nIn very severe cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed. This may take the form of: Steroid eye drops Steroid tablets Steroid injections While they are very effective, corticosteroids can cause serious side-effects and complications, so they are rarely used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. If symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are severe or do not improve with treatment, it is important to seek medical advice. Good to know: If a person has vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic conjunctivitis, they will be referred to an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor, for specialized treatment.",
    "complications": "While they may cause discomfort in daily life, most cases of seasonal and perennial (year-round) allergic conjunctivitis clear up completely, and complications are rare. However, in severe cases of contact conjunctivitis and giant papillary conjunctivitis, a person may develop inflammation, ulcers and scarring on the cornea, the front of their eye. This is called keratitis and requires urgent medical treatment to prevent long-term damage to vision. 3 4 14 Severe cases of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis can also cause long-term damage to the eyes if left untreated.",
    "allergic_conjunctivitis_in_babies_and_children": "The symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis listed above, as well as the treatment methods, are largely the same in children, toddlers and infants. It is advisable to see a doctor to confirm a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis and determine the best treatment approach for a child. If a newborn baby shows signs of conjunctivitis, it is important to consult a doctor without delay to identify the cause and receive appropriate treatment. Babies sometimes develop strains of viral conjunctivitis or bacterial conjunctivitis that can be very serious if left untreated.",
    "prevention": "While it may not be possible to prevent an episode of allergic pink eye, taking steps to limit exposure to known allergens, such as pollen, dust, mold or certain soaps, can help to minimize the likelihood and severity of its occurrence. For example, this may include: 4 15 Keeping windows closed and wearing wraparound sunglasses when outside during hay fever season Keeping the house as free of dust and mold as possible and using an air purifier Using hypoallergenic soaps and cosmetics",

    "allergic_conjunctivitis_faqs": "Q: Allergic conjunctivitis vs. pink eye – what is the difference? A: Pink eye is the common term for all types of conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is one type of pink eye and refers to pink eye that is caused by allergens. Other types of pink eye include viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis. Q: Bacterial conjunctivitis vs. allergic conjunctivitis – what is the difference? A: Bacterial conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by an infection of the eye(s) with bacteria. Allergic conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by allergens which lead to reactions in the eye(s). Some of the symptoms and treatments are different; antibiotic medications may be prescribed to treat bacterial conjunctivitis in severe cases of infection. Read more about Bacterial Conjunctivitis » Q: Is allergic conjunctivitis contagious? A: No, allergic conjunctivitis is not contagious. 2 Unlike viral conjunctivitis, which is caused by a virus, and bacterial conjunctivitis, which is caused by bacteria, allergic conjunctivitis cannot be spread to other people. It is the result of a specific person’s reaction to allergens which they are sensitive to, such as dust or seasonal pollen. Q: Can you have allergic conjunctivitis in one eye? A: Usually, allergic conjunctivitis is bilateral, meaning that it affects both eyes. It is possible that in a small number of cases, it may be unilateral, affecting only one eye. An example might be where an allergen comes into contact with just one of the eyes. However, most cases of unilateral conjunctivitis are caused by viruses or bacteria, or exposure to an irritant like a chemical substance, e.g. in a household cleaner spill that may affect the eye, and are therefore not allergic in nature. 16 17 Q: Can allergic conjunctivitis cause blurred vision? A: Blurry vision can be a symptom of allergic conjunctivitis, as well as other types of conjunctivitis . However, any blurred vision associated with mild cases of conjunctivitis should clear when the person blinks or when discharge is wiped away from the eyes. If the blurriness is severe or persistent, it is important to see a doctor without delay, as a serious eye condition may be present. 4 18 19 20 Q: Can allergic conjunctivitis cause discharge? A: Yes. A clear, watery discharge is a common symptom of allergic conjunctivitis. Q: What does allergic conjunctivitis look like? A: Signs of allergic conjunctivitis include: Pinkness or redness of the eyes and the inside of the eyelids Swelling of the eyelids Watery discharge from the eyes Other typical signs of allergy, such as sneezing and itchiness Q: Do I have allergic conjunctivitis? A: If you think that you may have allergic conjunctivitis, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Q: How long does allergic pink eye take to go away? A: This depends on the type and cause of the allergic conjunctivitis. Generally, symptoms will begin to improve once exposure to the allergen has been reduced and/or, where necessary, a course of medication has been started."

Typical symptoms of allergic rhinitis include: A runny nose Sneezing Itchy eyes\n\nAllergic rhinitis is one of the most common chronic diseases and is estimated to affect between 40 and 60 million people in the U.S. 1 Allergic rhinitis can be differentiated into three types: Hay fever, also known as seasonal rhinitis , which is triggered by exposure to outdoor allergens, such as pollen from plants Perennial rhinitis, which occurs all year round and is commonly provoked by allergens contained in dust, animal hair, and mold Occupational rhinitis, which describes an allergic reaction to particles encountered in a particular work environment, such as flour in a bakery There is no cure for allergic rhinitis, but the effects of the condition can be lessened with the use of nasal sprays and antihistamine medications. A doctor may recommend immunotherapy - a treatment option that can provide long-term relief. Steps can also be taken to avoid allergens. The severity of allergic rhinitis can also change over the course of an affected person’s life. This means, for example, that the effects of allergic rhinitis may fade during puberty, or that an affected person may develop a sensitivity to new allergens during adulthood.",

The IgE antibodies prompt the body to release chemicals, such as histamine, that cause inflammation in the nose and itchiness in the eyes. The allergens that trigger this kind of reaction vary from case to case.\n\nHay fever is caused by exposure to pollen and sometimes other outdoor allergens, such as mold. Plants produce most pollen in the summer months, making it the season when hay fever symptoms are generally at their most intense. Four of the primary triggers of hay fever are: 1 2 Grass pollen Pollen from trees Weed pollen Airborne mold Read more about hay fever »\n\nPerennial rhinitis or persistent allergic rhinitis describes a reaction to allergens that are present all year round. One regular definition is that symptoms last for an hour or more each day However, in some cases the severity of the condition will vary over the course of the year. 5 Some of the main causes are: 1 Dust mite feces Pet dander Pet saliva Pet and rodent urine Cockroach and other insect feces Indoor mold\n\nWhen the symptoms of allergic rhinitis only occur in a particular work environment, then this is known as occupational rhinitis. Allergens that cause perennial rhinitis are often involved, such as animal allergies for laboratory and farm workers. Some other examples include: 5 Grain dust affecting farmers and agricultural workers Flour affecting bakers Latex affecting medical workers wearing gloves Fish and seafood proteins affecting factory and kitchen workers\n\nWhile not allergens themselves, there are certain substances and situations that can worsen the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Some of these irritants include: 1 6 Cigarette smoke or wood smoke Fumes Humidity Pollution Changes in temperature\n\nRead more about non-allergic-rhinitis »",
    "allergic_rhinitis_risk_factors": "People whose families have a history of allergies are more likely to be diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. The genetic tendency to develop allergic rhinitis and other allergic conditions, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis (eczema) , is known as atopy. Up to 40 percent of those with allergic rhinitis also have asthma and as many as 80 percent of those diagnosed with asthma report experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms. 7 Research indicates that there are some environmental factors that can increase the likelihood of children developing allergic rhinitis. These include: 8 Inhaling cigarette smoke during childhood A mother using tobacco products while pregnant with the child Exposure to mold at home However, additional studies suggest that exposure to environmental or microbial biodiversity at a young age, such as living on a farm, may lessen the risk of developing allergic conditions. 9",
    "allergic_rhinitis_diagnosis": "Guidelines for diagnosis of allergic rhinitis are usually based on the symptoms reported by the affected person and their family history. Additional tests are sometimes required if the trigger for the allergic rhinitis is unknown. These tests involve giving the affected person small amounts of specific allergens to see if an allergic reaction takes place. This may include one or more of the following tests: 1 5\n\nAn intradermal test is normally the most accurate way to determine whether an individual is suffering from allergic rhinitis. Possible allergens, such as grass and weed pollen, are injected under the skin. After 20 minutes, the site is monitored for an allergic reaction, which usually involves reddening of the skin and an itching sensation.\n\nThe prick or scratch test is the most common type of skin test. It involves pricking or scratching the skin before exposure to an allergen-containing solution. The results are known within 10 to 20 minutes.\n\nThis method is often chosen if a reaction to an allergen is likely to be too severe to do a skin test. A blood test looks for the level of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody in the blood when exposed to different allergens. The more IgE there is when an allergen is introduced, the likelier it is that the affected person is allergic to that allergen. The results are generally less accurate than skin testing.",
    "allergic_rhinitis_treatment": "There is no cure for allergic rhinitis but its effects can be lessened by medication in the short-term, and, in some cases, sensitivity to the allergen can be reduced.\n\nHistamine is one of the chemicals released in the body after an allergic reaction, provoking uncomfortable symptoms for the affected person. Antihistamines work to limit the release of histamine or lessen its effects once it has been released into the body. They most commonly come in tablet form, but can also be administered in the following: 10 11 Syrups and liquids Eye drops Nasal sprays Ointments and creams Injections (in extreme cases) There are two types of antihistamines: The older first-generation or sedating antihistamines cause tiredness in the user Non-sedating or second-generation antihistamines are less likely to create fatigue Both types are generally as effective as each other in lessening the effect of allergic rhinitis. However, sedating antihistamines may be recommended if the condition is causing sleeping trouble. 11 It usually takes an antihistamine tablet about 30 minutes to begin working, and it will be at its most effective between one and two hours after consumption. 10\n\nNasal corticosteroids are sprays that reduce swelling and inflammation in the nose. They are also known as steroid nasal sprays. When suffering from seasonal rhinitis, it is often recommended to start using the spray before symptoms are expected to begin showing. 12 13 If nasal corticosteroids are used daily, then nasal congestion, sneezing, and other symptoms of allergic rhinitis are often significantly reduced. Other medicines and treatment methods are sometimes recommended in combination with the more common treatments or as alternatives. These include 5 :\n\nMast cell stabilizers, also known as chromones, work to block a type of white blood cell, known as a mast cell, from releasing histamine. They are produced as both nasal sprays and eye drops. 5 Mast cell stabilizers are generally a preventive measure but are also known to lessen the effect of symptoms.\n\nSome allergens will linger in the nose after exposure. Washing them out with a mixture of water and salt helps to alleviate the symptoms. This treatment is also known as nasal douching or saline sinus washouts. Kits are available to buy with the ingredients premixed, but a homemade mixture can be made out of: 14 One teaspoon of salt containing no iodine, anti-caking agents or preservatives One teaspoon of baking soda Two and a half cups of boiled water that has been left to cool The mixture is inserted into an affected person’s nostril repeatedly as they breathe in gently. This can be done using an instrument, such as a soft rubber ear bulb syringe. Cupping a small amount of liquid in a hand and sniffing it while the other nostril is sealed with a finger also works. Breathing in too intensely risks the liquid going into the back of the throat or the ears and causing discomfort. Other nasal medications may work better after a saline washout.\n\nDecongestant nasal sprays and nose drops make it easier to breathe by shrinking the blood vessels in the nose and relieving inflammation. However, they can only be used in the short-term. After too much use, increasingly large doses are needed to achieve the intended effect. At this stage, blood vessels begin to swell up again after the medication has worn off, causing what is known as rebound congestion. This risks the danger of a person becoming dependent on decongestant spray to relieve the congestion caused by the medication itself. The upper limit for the use of decongestants to treat allergic rhinitis is generally a week.\n\nIn severe cases, for example, if antihistamines and nasal corticosteroid medications do not manage the allergic rhinitis symptoms effectively, the doctor can prescribe a course of immunotherapy. This long-term treatment option serves to alter the body’s auto-immune response to the particular allergens which trigger allergic rhinitis. A course of immunotherapy typically begins about three months before exposure to hay fever triggers is likely to occur and involves either: A series of injections The administration of sublingual allergy tablets Treatment with sublingual immunotherapy involves daily administration of the allergens in liquid or tablet form, which is placed under the tongue. 15 Treatment with injections is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the affected person will be injected over a period of several weeks with increasingly concentrated doses of the allergen. During the second phase, the affected person will receive monthly top-up injections of the allergen at a uniform dose. 16",
    "preventing_allergic_rhinitis": "The trigger for allergic rhinitis is always a specific allergen , so doing as much as possible to avoid it is the most effective way to manage the affected person’s symptoms. Preventive measures vary depending on what kind of allergen is the trigger.\n\nResearch and preparedness can be very helpful in avoiding exposure to pollen. It is easy to find pollen counts online that tell the affected person how much of the allergen they are affected by is circulating in the atmosphere. Other tips for avoiding pollen are: 17 18 Keeping windows closed when the pollen count is high Washing thoroughly, including hair and eyes, after being outside Buying a pollen filter for a car, if driving Staying indoors until the afternoon, where possible Not mowing the lawn and, if someone else is, making sure to be inside Wearing sunglasses to protect eyes Avoiding extended outside activities, such as picnics Changing clothes after being outside\n\nDust mites are difficult to remove from a home and it is often hard to detect when they are there. However, the following steps may help reduce the number of mites and the allergens they produce: 17 19 Washing bedding regularly at high heat; at temperatures of over 130 degrees Fahrenheit or 60 degrees Celsius Covering bedding in dust mite resistant covers Keeping a home dry and well aired Removing soft toys, sheepskin and woolen underlays from sleeping areas or cleaning them regularly Removing upholstered furniture and using leather, plastic, vinyl and wood instead Avoiding carpets, rugs and mats; wooden floors are preferable Vacuuming thoroughly every week and wearing a mask while doing so Replacing heavy curtains with flat blinds that are easier to wipe down Opting for synthetic bedding rather than feather\n\nNot having a pet that causes an allergic reaction is the best solution for managing this type of allergic rhinitis. However, if that is impossible, the following steps are advisable for owners of dogs and/or cats: 20 Do not have the pet in the bedroom and try to confine it to specific areas of the house Bathe the animal weekly Keep the pet away from carpets Regularly wash all bedding the animal comes into contact with Use high-efficiency particulate air cleaners\n\nMold tends to grow best in damp and enclosed environments such as: 17 Bathrooms Basements Refrigerators Wardrobes Closets Humidifiers Mattresses On upholstery In waste containers Bedrooms with an en-suite bathroom Dealing with mold problems means trying to make the house as dry and ventilated as possible. All visible mold should be removed as a first step, with bleach or specially designed cleaning products. Other steps to take include: 17 Improving ventilation by opening doors and windows and installing extractor fans Regularly cleaning affected rooms Avoiding the use of humidifiers Keeping carpets dry and removing wet ones Fixing leaks in the house Getting rid of pot plants from inside and avoiding garden waste Unblocking gutters and vents",
    "allergic_rhinitis_complications": "There may be various complications that arise for those affected by allergic rhinitis. These can include:\n\nAllergic rhinitis can be very uncomfortable for the person affected. As a result of their symptoms, people with the condition can experience: 1 2 Tiredness, because of trouble sleeping Problems remembering things Irritability Decreased concentration Adults with allergic rhinitis are estimated to be 20 percent less productive than usual when the symptoms are at their worst. 21\n\nA middle ear infection, otherwise known as otitis media, is a viral or bacterial infection of the usually air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. In most cases, a middle ear infection affects just one ear, but can also occur in both ears simultaneously. Rhinitis can cause a blockage or swelling of the Eustachian tubes, which connect the throat and the middle ear. This results in reduced ventilation of the cavity behind the eardrum and may lead to a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. 22 23 A middle ear infection develops when bacteria or viruses that rise up, most often from the nasopharynx, grow in this fluid. The infection can cause painful inflammation. Read more about middle ear infections »\n\nSinusitis, also referred to as sinus infection or rhinosinusitis, is an inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are air-filled cavities within the bones of the face and nose. Sinusitis occurs when these cavities become inflamed and blocked, leading to a number of uncomfortable symptoms.  One possible cause of the condition  is rhinitis or associated complications such as nasal polyps. Symptoms of sinusitis include: Nasal discharge A blocked nose Tenderness around the head Sinus headaches Generally, sinusitis is a non-serious condition which can be managed through self-care methods and over-the-counter medication. In most cases, symptoms will disappear within two to three weeks. 5 Read more about viral sinusitis »\n\nNasal polyps are soft swellings on the inside of the nose and sinuses. Rhinitis may act as a trigger for the development of polyps. They may have no effect, but sometimes they are so large or numerous that they cause blockages between the nose and sinuses. This can lead to the conditions conducive for sinusitis to develop. Corticosteroid sprays, which are often prescribed for allergic rhinitis, can also be effective in treating nasal polyps. 5\n\nAttempts to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis by excessive rubbing or pushing the nose upwards with the hand can lead to damage of skin and cartilage. This has the potential to create a transverse nasal crease, a small groove in the skin of the affected person’s nose. 24",
    "allergic_rhinitis_faqs": "Q: Are there any home remedies for allergic rhinitis? A: The mixture for a saline nasal spray to wash the irritants out of the affected person’s nose can be made out of salt, baking soda and boiled then cooled water. Steps can be taken at home to minimise exposure to specific allergens, such as closing windows to keep out pollen.

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/alzheimers-disease/",
    "what_is_alzheimer_s_disease": "Alzheimer’s disease is a brain condition in which certain mental functions such as memory or reasoning are lost over time. It is the most common form of dementia. 1 The exact cause is unknown, but clumps of protein developing around the brain cells is a key feature of Alzheimer’s. 2 The condition is unlikely to affect people aged under 65. When this does occur, it is known as early-onset Alzheimer’s. Eating a healthy diet, getting plenty of exercise and avoiding smoking tobacco products are thought to lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 1 One in 10 people aged over 65 in the U.S. are thought to have the condition. Diagnosis is based on the symptoms. Doctors can also assess a person’s mental functioning by using written tests and interviews. Brain scans may also be used to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms to Alzheimer’s disease, such as head trauma or the effect of repeated concussions. Similar symptoms may also be caused by other types of dementia, which can sometimes affect a person at the same time as Alzheimer’s. 3 Alzheimer’s disease cannot be cured. However, a person may experience some relief from their symptoms after taking medication such as cholinesterase inhibitors. Therapy is also often recommended to help a person come to terms with the loss of their mental function. 1 4",
    "symptoms": "Which symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are evident often vary from person to person. It can depend on a number of factors, such as age, general health and how far the condition has progressed. The changes in the brain that cause Alzheimer’s will start occurring some time before any symptoms appear. While the exact symptoms vary from person to person, one of the first signs of the disease is usually memory difficulties. 5 Alzheimer’s disease will usually shorten a person’s lifespan. However, death is often directly caused by other conditions or even old age. 1 If you are concerned about the welfare of yourself or a loved one, check your symptoms with the Ada app .\n\nA person with preclinical Alzheimer’s is unlikely to show any symptoms, even when they are being tested. At this stage, the condition is beginning to affect a person’s brain, but not enough to cause any noticeable effect. 1\n\nThe first symptoms of Alzheimer’s are likely to include: 1 5 6 Loss of memory, specifically events that happened recently The above may lead to a person needing to ask the same questions repeatedly Needing more time to complete day-to-day tasks, for example handling money and paying bills Visual complaints, such as difficulty reading and driving\n\nAlong the course of Alzheimer’s, the following symptoms may be experienced: 1 5 Worsening memory loss and increasing confusion Shortening attention span Changes to usual personality and behaviour A growing reluctance to use initiative and try new things Increased emotion and anxiety Difficulty recognizing family and friends Increased difficulty with reading, writing and mathematical questions Difficulty learning new things The way to complete day-to-day tasks, such as getting dressed, may be forgotten Restlessness, agitation and annoyance Hallucinations, delusions and paranoia Lessened ability to think things through logically The need to wander, especially late in the day or in the evening Performing repetitive actions or repeating the same information when speaking An inability to control impulses, e.g. saying inappropriate things to others Muscular twitching\n\nAfter a person reaches late-stage Alzheimer’s, they effectively lose independence and will require a full-time carer. The affected person will be unable to communicate effectively, and their personality may seem to disappear. Towards the end of their life, it is possible that they will spend much of their time in bed or otherwise at rest. Symptoms associated with late-stage Alzheimer’s can include: 1 5 Weight loss Seizures Skin infections Difficulty swallowing Loss of bladder control An inability to speak coherently An increased need to sleep",
    "causes": "The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease are directly caused by the cells that transmit information to and from the brain, known as neurons, ceasing to function and eventually dying. However, what causes this to occur is not yet known. 7 The first neurons that begin to die are usually located in the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is involved in forming memories. Along with neuron death, a hallmark of the condition is the development of clumps of protein in the brain, known as plaques, as well as tangles of fibers called tau. The relationship between tau, plaques and neuron death is not clearly understood. It is not unusual for people to be diagnosed with another dementia, such as vascular dementia, alongside Alzheimer’s. This is known as mixed dementia. 8",
    "alzheimer_s_disease_risk_factors": "The primary risk factor for Alzheimer’s is age. Most people affected by Alzheimer’s do not begin to show symptoms until they are over 65. 9 Other circumstances that may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease include genetic and lifestyle factors.\n\nAbout one in 20 cases is caused by a person inheriting certain genes from their parents. People with this genetically-inherited form of the condition are almost certain to develop early-onset Alzheimer’s, which is when symptoms of the disease show before the affected person is 65. 9 10 No specific gene has been discovered that causes late-onset Alzheimer’s. However, inheriting a type of gene variation known as apolipoprotein E  4,  makes developing the condition more likely though not certain. The majority of Alzheimer’s cases are known as sporadic, which means that genetics are not a factor. Nevertheless, having a direct relation that has been affected by dementia increases the risk of a person developing Alzheimer’s by between 10 and 30 percent. If a person’s family includes two or more siblings that have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, then they are three times as likely to be affected by the condition compared with the general population. 11\n\nThere appears to be a link between diseases of the vascular system, the network that transports blood around the body, and Alzheimer’s disease. Vascular diseases include coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease . As a result, avoiding some of the potential causes for unhealthy blood vessels is possibly the best way to protect oneself against Alzheimer’s disease. 1 This includes: ref1 10 12 13 Getting plenty of exercise Staying in shape, e.g. through a healthy diet Avoiding smoking tobacco products Avoiding consuming too much alcohol\n\nThese include: 9 10 14 Down’s syndrome, also known as trisomy 21. Around half of people with this condition will develop Alzheimer’s disease Traumatic brain injury Insulin resistance, which can also lead to Type 2 diabetes Depression Hypertension Obesity",
    "diagnosis": "There is no definitive test for Alzheimer’s disease. Instead, a doctor will usually make a diagnosis based on the symptoms and several tests. A family member or friend may need to be involved to be asked questions about the severity of symptoms, as the person affected may not be the best guide in respect of how they are behaving. 15 There are plenty of other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to Alzheimer’s. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is brain damage linked to multiple concussions , and Parkinson’s disease are two such examples. A doctor may run blood tests and brain scans to discover whether a condition other than Alzheimer’s is responsible for the affected person’s symptoms or if they have another condition in addition to Alzheimer’s. 13 16\n\nA short test that assesses a person’s mental function will often be used to help a doctor in their diagnosis. The test will generally look at: 17 Problem solving Attention span Memory Counting Language This test is known as a mini-mental state exam or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\n\nThis is a longer, more extensive test, which may be carried out by a type of doctor known as a neuropsychologist. A neuropsychological test usually takes several hours and will assess the following: 18 19 Memory Attention span Mental processing Mental reasoning Judgement Visuospatial function, i.e. the way a person relates what they see to the world around them\n\nPeople suspected of being affected by Alzheimer’s will likely undergo brain scans, which allow doctors to look in detail at an image of the brain. This will be one of the following: 20 A CT scan of the head, which uses X-Rays to create the image An MRI scan, which uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create the image Although there may be some evidence of Alzheimer’s in the image produced by the scan, this test will mostly be to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms, such as stroke or a brain tumor.",
    "treating_alzheimer_s": "Treatment for Alzheimer’s is focused on suppressing symptoms and maintaining brain function for as long as possible. No medication currently exists to stop the progression of the disease.\n\nThere are two medications that are used to suppress Alzheimer’s symptoms. Treatment is not always effective, but for some people these drugs can bring relief from symptoms and allow a person to maintain a higher level of mental functioning for longer than they otherwise would have. People affected by mild to moderate Alzheimer’s will generally be given cholinesterase inhibitors. These slow the breakdown of acetylcholine, a chemical in the brain that helps neurons send messages to other cells. 21 As Alzheimer’s progresses, a doctor may prescribe memantine. This drug makes sure that the buildup of calcium in between brain cells, too much of which can cause nerve damage, is regulated. 23 Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can sometimes be taken at the same time. A doctor will generally advise whether this is appropriate,\n\nThe difficulties a person faces during Alzheimer’s will often cause a number of mood symptoms, such as depression or anxiety. There are a number of medications which may be recommended to help with these issues. These include: 24 Antidepressants Antipsychotics Anti-anxiety aids Medication to assist with sleeping\n\nAn occupational therapist may be able to help someone with Alzheimer’s or the person helping care for them adjust to some of the changes that the condition can cause. For example, a weekly pill box and the use of alarms and reminders can be a big help. 25 Cognitive stimulation therapy may also be recommended. This includes structured sessions in which people complete tasks that stimulate thinking and memory. This has been shown to be beneficial to people with mild to moderate dementia. 26 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other talking therapies that assist with anxiety and depression may be recommended for people affected by those symptoms because of Alzheimer’s. 25\n\nKeeping active is advisable during Alzheimer’s, if possible. 25 People with a high level of fitness seem to have some protective effects against the progression of the disease. 21 Exercise is also generally beneficial to a person’s physical and mental health.",
    "faqs": "Q:What trials and research are going on for Alzheimer’s disease? A: The uncertain cause of brain deterioration during Alzheimer’s disease has meant that attempts to find a treatment to cure or halt symptoms has been difficult. Research areas have included: 27 Attempt to slow down or stop the formation of plaques (anti-amyloid therapy) Attempts to minimize the negative effects of tau Attempts to protect the brain from atoms called free radicals that have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease Treatment with Vitamin E to slow some of the processes linked to Alzheimer’s Vitamin E trials have shown some success at slowing the progression of the disease, though the effect is moderate. The other trials have not yet found an effective treatment. A recent study claims to have shown a link between the bacteria behind gum disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Research into this line of inquiry is ongoing. 28 Q: Are people who have had a depressive episode more likely to develop Alzheimer’s? A: The majority of people that have experienced depression will not go on to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. However, several studies in the U.S. and elsewhere do suggest that a person affected by depression at some point in their life does have a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s than someone who has never had a depressive episode. 29 The link between depression and Alzheimer’s remains poorly understood. Depression also often develops once a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Antidepressant medication and therapy help a person with the symptoms of a depressive episode . 24 26 25 Q: Is Alzheimer’s disease hereditary? A: About one in 20 cases of Alzheimer’s is a version of the disease inherited directly from a person’s parents. This type of Alzheimer’s is almost always early-onset, meaning it affects people when they are younger than 65. Besides this rare version of Alzheimer’s disease, there are no genes that are known to directly cause the condition. Read more about Alzheimer’s disease risk factors » Q: What support exists for people experiencing Alzheimer’s disease? A: There are many online resources offering help on specific aspects of Alzheimer’s disease, such as the U.S. government’s ADEAR center . In-person support groups such as those organized by the Alzheimer’s Association and the Alzheimer’s Foundation of America help those affected by the condition, as well as carers, in dealing with the disease. “ How Is Alzheimer's Disease Treated? .” 01 April, 2018.

    "condition": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/",
    "what_is_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis_als": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known motor neuron disease (MND) in the U.K. or Lou Gehrig’s Disease in the U.S., is defined as a rare, progressive neurological disorder which causes nerve damage and muscle weakness. ALS affects and destroys nerve cells, called motor neurons, which are located within the spinal cord and brain and which control muscle movement. The destruction of these nerves causes progressive muscle weakness and eventually leads to paralysis. 1 The cause of ALS is not known. Early symptoms include tingling or weakness in arms or legs , muscle cramping and sometimes changes to the voice. There is no treatment to cure ALS, though there are some medications that slow down the destruction of the nerve cells. Management of this condition aims to relieve the symptoms of ALS/MND and support the person and their family. Around 20,000 people in the United States have ALS and 6,000 people are diagnosed with the condition each year. The course of ALS/motor neuron disease varies from person to person, but in most people the condition will progress within three to five years (see FAQs). However, there are famous examples of people living for decades with ALS, such as the physicist Stephen Hawking. 2 3 4 Although the progression of the muscle weakness is different from person to person, most people with ALS will eventually die as a result of the condition.",
    "symptoms": "Early symptoms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can be different for each person. The progression of ALS may also vary from person to person. However, the common factor is a progressive weakness and wasting of muscles and eventual paralysis.\n\nInitial signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis will vary depending on the person. Common early symptoms of ALS include: 5 6 Muscle weakness and tingling in the arms, legs, or neck Muscle twitches in the arms, legs, shoulder or tongue Muscle cramps Stiff muscles Slurred speech or voice becoming more nasal Difficulty swallowing or chewing Bouts of uncontrollable emotion, such as crying or laughter, caused by pseudobulbar affect (PBA). (See FAQs ) Early symptoms of ALS/motor neuron disease might be noticed as increased clumsiness, such as tripping over, dropping items or having difficulty with fine motor skills such as writing or fastening buttons.\n\nHow amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progresses will vary from person to person. Most people will experience these symptoms as different muscles become weaker: 5 6 Being unable to walk Being unable to stand Losing the use of hands and arms Having difficulty swallowing or chewing, leading to coughing or choking when eating or drinking Having difficulty speaking Having difficulty breathing Weight loss Most people with ALS retain their memories, reasoning and decision-making capabilities. This retained awareness can lead to depression as the physical aspect of ALS progresses. In a small number of cases, a person with ALS may develop a form of dementia. 7 When breathing muscles become affected, the person will need support from a ventilator to continue breathing. People with ALS are also at risk of developing aspiration pneumonia, caused by inhaling food or stomach contents. 8 9 Good to know: ALS does not affect the senses, such as sight, hearing and touch. It also generally does not affect the bladder.",
    "causes": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis occurs when certain types of nerve cells, called neurons, degenerate and die. Motor neurons control muscle actions which can be voluntarily controlled, such as walking, speaking and breathing. Normally, upper motor neurons in the brain transmit messages to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord, and from there to muscles. Without input from nerves, muscles do not move, and so become weak and wasted. When a person has ALS, both upper and lower motor neurons start to die. 5 10 It is the involvement of motor neurons that leads to one name for this condition being motor neuron disease. What causes ALS is not known. Men are slightly more likely to develop ALS than women, and most people develop the condition between the ages of 55 and 75. Some studies suggest ALS may be up to twice as common in military veterans. This is thought to be because of exposure to environmental toxins such as pesticides or lead. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes ALS as a service-related condition. 5 11\n\n5 to 10 percent of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases are genetic. Only one parent needs to carry a gene for ALS/MND. There are thought to be at least 12 genetic mutations that can cause familial ALS. 5",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is made by evaluating the symptoms and undergoing a physical examination by a neurologist. There is no single diagnostic test for ALS. However, several tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of symptoms, such as HIV, polio or West Nile virus. 5 There are four criteria required for a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: 12 Degeneration of lower motor neurons, in the spinal cord and brainstemDegeneration of upper motor neurons, in the brainSymptoms start in one body part and spread to other parts of the bodyLack of other explanations for symptoms Tests that are used to diagnose ALS/MND include: 5 6 12 13 14 Electromyogram (EMG), which uses needles to measure electrical signals between nerves and muscles Nerve conduction study (NCS), which uses electrode patches to measure electrical signals along nerves Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test, which produces images of the brain and spinal cord Lumbar puncture (spinal tap), which uses a needle inserted between two vertebrae to withdraw spinal cord fluid for testing Muscle biopsy, which is rarely used and involves removing a small sample of muscle under local anaesthesia for testing Blood tests , to exclude other potential causes for symptoms",
    "treatment_for_amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis_als": "There is no cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Treatment involves managing the progression of ALS and providing as good a quality of life as possible. Recent years have seen advances in the ability to manage ALS symptoms.\n\nRiluzole is believed to work by reducing, but not reversing, damage to motor neurons. It can delay the need for a tracheostomy (see section on Breathing support). Riluzole is a tablet that should be taken twice a day. Side effects associated with riluzole include: 5 15 Tiredness Dizziness Upset stomach and stomach pain Diarrhea Muscle aches Headache Edaravone is an antioxidant that has been shown to slow the decline of people with ALS, possibly by slowing nerve damage. It is injected intravenously and given initially for the first 14 days of a 28 day cycle, and for the first 10 days in future 28 day cycles. Side effects associated with edaravone include: 5 16 Bruising Headache Itchy or scaly rash Difficulties breathing, wheezing and chest tightness Edaravone is not available in all countries. Other medications can help relieve symptoms of ALS such as muscle cramps, drooling and the pseudobulbar affect.\n\nAs ALS progresses and the muscles that control breathing atrophy, there are various interventions that can be used to aid breathing: 5 17 Noninvasive ventilation (NIV): uses a mask or nose tube to deliver air into the nose and/or mouth. NIV may initially only be needed at night but, as ALS progresses, can be used all the time. Assisted coughing: atrophy of the muscles that control coughing increase the risk of dangerous mucus plugs in the airways. An assisted coughing device can help clear the airways, or a breathing technique called breath stacking can help. Mechanical ventilation: when breathing muscles atrophy further, a machine may be needed to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation can be provided by a breathing tube through the mouth, or a tracheostomy. In a tracheostomy, a hole is made surgically in the windpipe and a breathing tube is placed through it, which is attached to a ventilator. Modern ventilators are portable and allow the person more independence. After a tracheotomy, although the vocal cords are left in place, the tracheostomy tube means that air does not pass over them, making normal speech difficult. However,  there are valves available that modify the airflow in the tracheotomy tube and offer some speech retention. 18 19\n\nPhysical therapy can help a person with ALS maintain their mobility for longer. Exercises can include: 5 17 Swimming Cycling on a stationary bike Walking Stretching exercises Most people with ALS will need a wheelchair for mobility, and, particularly in the later stages, an electric wheelchair may be preferred and allow more independence. Speech therapy can teach methods of communicating that are louder and clearer, and use less energy as the speaking muscles degenerate. Speech synthesizers are an option for later stages of ALS.\n\nPreventing weight loss is an important aspect of treatment for ALS to help a person maintain strength. Nutritionists can advise on types of food that are easy to swallow and offer a healthy diet. In the later stages of ALS a feeding tube may be necessary to provide additional nutrition and to avoid the risk of choking. 5 17",

    "amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis_als_faqs": "Q: Are ALS and MS related? A: People with multiple sclerosis (MS) have a condition where their nerve coatings (myelin) are damaged. Both conditions can cause muscle weakness and wasting, but MS is not fatal. MS tends to affect people at a younger age, and MS symptoms can come and go. In MS, vision is often affected, which is not the case in ALS. Q: Are ALS and Muscular Dystrophy related? A: Muscular Dystrophy is a condition where muscle tissue wastes away but nerves are not affected. It is generally inherited and is often present in early life. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affects a person’s nervous system. Q: Why is ALS/MND also called Lou Gehrig’s disease? A: Lou Gehrig was a famous baseball player for the New York Yankees. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1939 and died in 1941, though there is some modern debate about whether his death was actually caused by neurological injuries caused by concussions received while playing baseball. Lou Gehrig was the first well-known person to develop ALS in the United States, so the condition became popularly associated with him. Q: Is ALS always fatal? A: Yes. Most people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis die from respiratory failure within three to five years of symptoms first appearing. However, life expectancy for people with ALS can be longer: 10 percent of people with ALS will live another 10 years and 5 percent will live another 20 years or more. 2 Q: Is ALS genetic? A: In most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis the cause is unknown. However, in around 5 to 10 percent of cases, there is thought to be a genetic factor. See the section on Familial ALS. Q: What is the pseudobulbar affect? A: The pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a condition that causes uncontrolled laughing and crying that is not appropriate for the situation. A person may laugh uproariously at a joke that others find only mildly amusing, or may experience a bout of crying in response to a sad television show. Crying is more common than laughter, and PBA can be mistaken for depression. However, the mood of a person with pseudobulbar affect is normal between episodes."

    "what_is_anal_cancer": "Anal cancer is a rare cancer that arises from the anus. The anus is comprised of the anal canal, a passage about 3-4 cm or 1.5 inches and the anal margin, also known as perianal skin, the opening where feces is excreted from the body. Anal cancer refers to several types of cancer that can develop in this area. The most common symptoms of anal cancer include bleeding from the anus, itching around the anus, and anal pain. Many non-cancerous conditions have similar initial symptoms, such as anal fissure or hemorrhoids . Anal cancer tends to spread slowly. With early treatment, in many cases, it has a relatively good prognosis. 2 This condition tends to affect older adults between the ages of 50 and 80, and is slightly more common in women than in men. 3 About 1.8 per 100,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed with anal cancer per year. 4 Treatment depends on the type of anal cancer and stage of diagnosis, but typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Recovery rates tend to be better in cases where the cancer is diagnosed early.",
    "types": "Anal cancers are often divided into two groups, which are sometimes treated differently: 5 Cancers of the anal margin: These begin in the cells of the anal margin - the edge of the anus that can be partly seen as darker skin on the outside of the body. They are more common in men and have a relatively good prognosis. Cancers of the anal canal: These begin in the cells of the anal canal –the inner part of the anus, connecting the rectum – the final section of the intestine, that connects it to the anus – to the anal margin. They are more common in women and have a relatively worse prognosis. There are several different types of anal cancer. These include: 5\n\nCarcinoma in situ is considered by some doctors to be the earliest form of anal cancer, and by others to be a precancerous condition, which may develop into cancer. In carcinoma in situ, there are abnormal cells on the surface layer of the anus, which have not spread to any deeper layers.\n\nSquamous cell carcinomas are the most common type of anal cancer, making up 80 or 90 percent of cases. It starts in the squamous cells which form the surface layer of the lining the anal margin and anal canal. This is similar to carcinoma in situ, except that these cancers have grown into the deeper cells and layers of the anal canal, and may spread.\n\nAdenocarcinomas  make up about 15 percent of anal cancers. These may start in glands in the anal area or in the cells that line the part of the anus near the rectum.\n\nSome anal cancers are basal cell carcinomas or malignant melanomas - two different types of skin cancer. Only a very small portion of anal cancers are skin cancers.\n\nOther, very rare types of anal cancer include: Lymphomas Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)",
    "anal_cancer_symptoms": "Anal cancer may present with a wide range of symptoms, or may have no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms of anal cancer include: 7 Bleeding from the anus Anal or pelvic pain Anal itching Discharge from the anus A lump in or near the anus Less common symptoms may include: 7 A change in bowel habits, such as increased gas, losing control of one’s bowel, or hard or soft feces Severe or complete constipation Swollen lymph nodes in the groin and anal region Most often these symptoms are more likely to be caused by non-cancerous conditions, such as hemorrhoids , anal fissures , or anal warts . If any of these symptoms are present, it is important to see a doctor quickly so that the cause can be found and treated appropriately.",
    "anal_cancer_causes": "The causes of anal cancer are not well understood. However, certain factors are thought to increase a person’s risk of developing the condition. It is most commonly linked to human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection (STI) which more commonly causes genital and anal warts.\n\nFactors that may increase the risk of developing anal cancer include: 3 8 Human papillomavirus (HPV) A history of cervical or vaginal cancer A lowered immune response, such as occurs with HIV or from medication taken after organ transplantation Smoking tobacco Being over 50 Receptive anal intercourse Repeated inflammation in the anal region Anal cancer is most common in people between the ages of 50 and 80, and it is slightly more common in women than in men.",
    "anal_cancer_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms in patients who are being treated for anal cancer. This is because cancer therapy weakens the immune system, which puts you at a higher risk to get infected with the coronavirus. It's important to take the necessary precautions, and to get tested as soon as possible if you start experiencing symptoms. Talk to your doctor to find out whether you're eligible for antiviral medication .",
    "anal_cancer_diagnosis": "Symptoms of anal cancer may be caused by a number of other conditions, including hemorrhoids , anal fissures , or anal warts . A doctor will need to rule these out in the diagnostic process.\n\nAs the first step, a doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. In addition, a doctor may perform the following tests: 2 9 Digital rectal examination (DRE) , which involves inserting a gloved finger into the anus to feel for lumps or other abnormalities. Anoscopy may be performed if the doctor feels a suspicious area during DRE. The doctor will insert into the anus a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end called an anoscope, allowing them to see the inside of the anus. Biopsy , a procedure to remove a small amount of tissue for examination under a microscope, can make a definite diagnosis. The type of biopsy will depend on the location of the abnormal cells, but may include an excisional biopsy to remove an entire lump. Ultrasound, X-ray, computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET scan) may be used to investigate the size of the cancer. If any of the results of these tests are positive for cancer, further investigation is done to confirm the staging of the cancer.\n\nScreening is a way of identifying apparently healthy people who may be at an increased risk of a particular condition . This is often done to help identify cancers at the earliest stages, when treatment can provide the best prognosis. Anal cancer is not very common, so screening of the general public is not widely done. However, people who are considered to have a higher than average risk of developing anal cancer may be advised to undergo regular screening for the condition. Screening tests for anal cancer may include: 10 Digital rectal examinations Anal cytology testing, also known as an anal Pap test or smear An anal Pap smear is very similar to a Pap smear for cervical cancer. The anal lining is swabbed to collect cells, which are then looked at under a microscope to see if any cells show pre-cancerous signs. Those who might benefit from anal cancer screening include: 10 11 People who are HIV positive Men who have sex with men Women who have had cervical cancer or vulvar cancer People who take immunosuppressants after receiving an organ transplant Occasionally, people with a history of anal warts are recommended to have screening",
    "anal_cancer_treatment": "The treatment of anal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. Anal cancer can be treated by one or more of the following: Radiotherapy Surgery Chemotherapy Often, the first step in treatment for anal cancer is a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, known as combined modality therapy (CMT). Anal cancer may be curable in this way without the need for surgery.\n\nThe general aims of chemotherapy treatment for anal cancer are to destroy any tumor tissue and increase the likelihood of recovery. Chemotherapy can sometimes have unpleasant side effects, such as hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side effects, should they occur. Read more about Chemotherapy Side-Effects .\n\nAlso known as radiation therapy, this uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Radiation for anal cancer can have unpleasant side-effects, such as diarrhea, skin irritation and nausea. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side-effects, should they occur.\n\nSurgery is not normally the first treatment for anal cancer. If needed, the type of surgery will depend on the type and size of tumor. There are two main types of anal cancer surgery: 12 13\n\nThis removes the tumor and a small area of normal tissue around it. A local resection is commonly used for tumors on the anal margin – the skin at the end of the canal that meets the anus opening – that are small and have not spread to other tissues or to lymph nodes. Local resection normally allows the sphincters to be saved, so that a person may continue normal bowel movements after surgery.\n\nAbdominoperineal resection (APR) is an operation in which the anus and rectum are removed, possibly along with some nearby groin lymph nodes. APR requires a colostomy, in which the end of the colon is diverted out through the wall of the abdomen, leading to an external bag to collect stool and other human waste. Good to know: APR is only used if other treatments don’t work or if the cancer returns after treatment. Nowadays, APR can almost always be avoided by using chemotherapy and radiotherapy instead. APR surgery is more likely to cause long-term complications, such as urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage side-effects, should they occur.",
    "anal_cancer_prognosis": "Anal cancer tends to spread slowly. With early treatment, in many cases it has a relatively good prognosis and may be curable. 2 In order to determine how the cancer should be treated, such as whether potentially life-changing surgery will be required, doctors will find out the size of the cancer and whether it has spread or metastasized to nearby lymph nodes or to distant organs, in a process known as staging . Earlier stage cancers are more likely to be curable than more advanced stages, i.e. with larger tumors, and/or cancers that have spread. Factors associated with poorer outcomes may include: 14 15 Tumors in the anal canal rather than the anal margin Tumors greater than 5cm Tumors that invade nearby organs such as the urethra or bladder Lymph node involvement Being HIV positive\n\nSurvival rates show what percentage of people live for a certain length of time after being diagnosed with cancer. Survival rates are generally sorted into 5-year and 10-year time brackets. Because the statistic is based on people diagnosed over five years ago, the outlook may be better for those diagnosed today, since there are continuing improvements in treatment. Survival rates include people who are free of disease or who experience few symptoms, as well as those who are still being treated for cancer, those who will survive for many more years and those who will not live much longer than the time bracket given. Five-year survival rates for people with anal cancer in the U.S. are currently as follows: 3 16 Localized anal cancer: About half of all anal cancers are found early, when they are localized, meaning they have not spread beyond the anus. The five-year survival rate is about 80 percent. Locally advanced anal cancer: If the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or other areas around the anus, this is known as locally advanced cancer. The five-year survival rate is about 61 percent. Metastatic cancer: If the cancer has spread further to other parts of the body, it is known as metastatic cancer. The five-year survival rate is about 30 percent. The overall five-year survival rate for anal cancer is about 66 percent. Good to know: Survival rates do not predict what will happen to someone. Treatment and responses to treatment vary greatly.",
    "anal_cancer_faqs": "Q: Anus cancer vs hemorrhoids - how can I tell the difference? A: Hemorrhoids , also known as piles, is a very common condition involving dilated rectal veins, that typically causes no serious health problems. It can often be treated at home, without being seen by a doctor. Some symptoms of hemorrhoids , especially bleeding from the anus, may also be caused by anal cancer, a serious condition requiring prompt treatment. Other common symptoms between the two conditions include pain, pressure, itching, mucus discharge, and a lump in or around the anus. Swelling of the lymph nodes around the anus or in the groin may be a sign of anal cancer. A hard growth tends to suggest anal cancer while a squishy swelling suggests hemorrhoids. For more information on what they look and feel like, see this resource on hemorrhoids. A person should seek help for hemorrhoid symptoms if they have heavy rectal bleeding or bleeding that is not responding to home care, or hemorrhoid symptoms accompanied by fever, weight loss, abdominal pain , or a change in bowel habits. Q: Is anal cancer curable? A: Anal cancer tends to spread slowly. With early treatment, in many cases, it has a relatively good prognosis and may be curable. Earlier-stage cancers are more likely to be curable than larger tumors and cancers that have spread. Factors associated with poorer outcomes may include: Tumors in the anal canal rather than the anal margin Tumors greater than 5cm Tumors that invade nearby organs such as the urethra or bladder Lymph Node involvement Being HIV positive Q: Is anal cancer painful? A: A person may experience pain due to anal cancer. The severity of the pain may depend on many factors, including the stage of the cancer, the treatment plan, and the affected person’s tolerance for pain. The cancer itself may cause pain, or pain may be a side effect of anal cancer treatments. Those with advanced anal cancer are most likely to have severe pain. Medical care for anal cancer will include pain relief. Q: Anal cancer vs colon cancer - what is the difference? A: Colon cancer, also known as colorectal cancer , occurs in the colon or large intestine, the final six-foot section of the large intestine up to the anal canal. Anal cancer refers to several types of cancer that affect the anus, which is comprised of the anal canal, a passage about 3-4 cm or 1.5 inches connected to the colon and the anal margin, also known as perianal skin, the opening where feces is excreted from the body. Colon cancer is the second most common cancer in the U.S. and third-most-common cause of death from cancer, whereas anal cancer is rare and has a fairly good prognosis because it is more likely to be caught early and tends to spread slowly."

    "condition": "Anal Fissure",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/anal-fissure/",
    "what_is_an_anal_fissure": "An anal fissure is a common condition where there is a painful tear in the lining of the anus, the backside opening where feces is excreted. It is often described as feeling like passing broken glass. 1 Typical anal fissure symptoms are a sensation of tearing, ripping or burning and usually a small amount of bright red bleeding during and after a bowel movement. While the condition can be very painful, it is not usually serious.\n\nIt is estimated that about one in 10 people may have an anal fissure in their lifetime, though it is not possible to establish a precise figure, because some people may be too embarrassed to discuss the condition with their healthcare provider, and it is often misattributed to hemorrhoids . 2 Anal fissure treatment generally involves softening the stool, avoiding constipation where possible and practicing good hygiene. Anal fissures typically heal within six weeks. An anal fissure that lasts for more than six weeks is called a chronic anal fissure. Occasionally, surgery is required to repair the tear. Both males and females can be affected and, while anal fissures may occur at any age, they are primarily seen in young adults. 3",
    "types": "Anal fissure may be classed as: Acute anal fissure, which clears up within six weeks. This is the most common type, and normally appears as linear with clear edges. Chronic anal fissure, which persists for more than six weeks. Chronic anal fissure healing time varies. Without treatment, it is possible to have an anal fissure for years. A chronic fissure is usually deeper than an acute anal fissure and is often associated with an external skin tag. Chronic fissure is usually treatable, but recurrence of the fissure after treatment is common. 1 An anal fissure may also be classed as: 4 5 Primary: due to local trauma, such as constipation or vaginal delivery of a baby Secondary: due to an underlying condition process, such as ulcerative colitis Crohn’s disease or chlamydia",
    "anal_fissure_symptoms": "The most common anal fissure symptoms may include: 6 7 A sharp, searing or burning pain in or around the bottom, which tends to be worse when passing feces and for about an hour or so afterwards Some bleeding, usually bright red on the toilet paper or stool Itching 3\n\nLess common anal fissure symptoms may include: 1 8 Spasms or a tightening feeling in the anus when feces is excreted A sentinel pile, a tag of skin which sometimes develops on the edge of the anus, below the fissure Abscesses: painful boil-like swellings near the anus filled with pus, which may lead to a fistula – a tunnel from the anal canal to the external skin, which may have a foul-smelling mucus discharge",
    "causes": "An anal fissure can occur when there is overstretching of the anal canal, which causes the lining to tear. Common causes include a large, hard or otherwise traumatic bowel movement, or anal penetration. 9 Subsequent bowel movements stretch the area, meaning that healing is hindered. The anal sphincter may spasm as a result of anal fissure, restricting blood supply to the area and further hindering the healing process. In children especially, putting off bowel movements to avoid the associated pain may worsen constipation and exacerbate the problem. Causes of anal fissure may include the following.\n\nAnal fissure most commonly occurs due to constipation. Lots of factors may cause constipation, but the most common include: 7 10 Not eating enough fiber Not drinking enough fluids Some medications, particularly strong painkillers, such as opioids Not exercising or being less active Frequently ignoring the urge to defecate Changing diet or daily routine Anxiety or depression Some medical conditions, such as an underactive thyroid gland Read more about persistent constipation and possible treatments » .\n\nAnal fissure can occur in pregnancy . During pregnancy, women often experience constipation due to the increased weight of the baby putting pressure on the rectum, the final segment of the digestive system, which stores feces until a person is ready to defecate. Childbirth causes anal fissure in about one in 10 women.\n\nOther possible causes of anal fissure include: 6 11 Persistent diarrhea A sexually transmitted infection, such as anal herpes or chlamydia, which cause the tissues to become soft and fragile Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), meaning ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease Trauma, for instance from rough or inadequately lubricated anal intercourse, or other insertion of foreign objects Unusually tight anal sphincter muscles or anal spasm Previous anal surgery Anal cancer can have similar symptoms to benign anal fissure Certain other cancers, e.g. leukemia Often, no clear cause for an anal fissure can be found. They are associated with tight anal sphincter muscles, though the cause of this is unknown.",
    "diagnosis_and_tests": "A doctor may diagnose anal fissure based on a description of the symptoms and a physical examination. The physical examination usually involves gently separating the buttocks to allow a doctor to see the area around the anus. Most fissures appear in the 12 or 6 o’clock position. Those in other locations are likely to be associated with an underlying disorder, such as Crohn’s disease. A doctor will usually avoid inserting anything into the anal canal, such as a gloved finger or small instrument, as this can cause substantial pain and is often unnecessary for provisional diagnosis. 3 If there is recurring or chronic anal fissure, endoscopy procedures to look inside the body may be recommended to look for underlying causes. These are avoided in cases of an acute anal fissure, as they are not normally well tolerated. Often, the patient is at first treated solely on the basis of symptoms. If needed, procedures may include:\n\nThis involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera on the end into the anal canal. Sometimes, topical anesthetic is used to facilitate an anoscopy.\n\nThose who have a chronic or recurrent anal fissure after surgical therapy may be evaluated further with anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, a procedure similar to anoscopy, but which also examines the lower colon . 12\n\nSometimes, a colonoscopy procedure is used to look for the presence of an underlying condition that may be causing an anal fissure, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . This is similar to an anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, but which also examines the entire colon . Read about Preparing for a Colonoscopy » .\n\nWrongful diagnosis of anal fissure can also occur because it is more common than some conditions with similar symptoms. This may result in other conditions going undetected and untreated, such as infection and, though it is rare, anal cancer. 13 This can occur as anal fissure is more common and may have similar symptoms. Though medical attention should always be sought where there is any bleeding from the anus, the Ada app can help you check your symptoms.",
    "treating_anal_fissure": "Treatment of an anal fissure primarily aims to ease the pain. Anal fissure treatment generally begins with following a high-fiber diet, as well as maintaining sufficient fluid intake to soften feces and prevent further damage to the area while the wound is healing. Pain medication will usually also be prescribed. Usually, an anal fissure will heal with home treatment. In the case of chronic anal fissure, however, occasionally surgery will be recommended.\n\nAnal fissure pain relief and other medicines may include: 11 14\n\nThis should be applied before going to the toilet. Anesthetic creams and ointments can be obtained by prescription or over the counter. Anesthetic ointments should only be used for short periods of up to about five to seven days, otherwise the skin around the anus may become irritated.\n\nTopical steroids may be recommended to ease swelling if it is severe. This may help to relieve pain and any itching. Steroids should not be used for more than one week at a time to avoid side effects, such as skin thinning or enlarged blood vessels. 7\n\nIbuprofenand paracetamol can help to ease pain. Opioids should be avoided, as this can cause constipation, which may worsen the condition and is potentially addictive.\n\nAn anal fissure will heal more easily if feces is kept soft, so that it can pass more easily. A diet involving plenty of high-fiber foods may help, such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Medication that works as a stool softener may also be obtained on prescription or bought over the counter at pharmacies.\n\nThese medications may be prescribed for chronic anal fissures, present for six weeks or more. This is applied to the skin to reduce the anal sphincter pressure and can decrease pain and facilitate further healing. Side effects include headache, so the correct amount must be used.\n\nOther general measures that are recommended alongside medicine for anal fissure may include: 6 11 Washing the area carefully with water after using the toilet, to avoid irritation and infection. Soap should be avoided as this may cause irritation, and the area should be gently dried. Sitz baths for anal fissure may be recommended as they are thought to soothe and relax the anus muscles, relieving some of the painful internal sphincter muscle spasm. This involves sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation. Measures to avoid constipation and keep feces soft to help heal an anal fissure may include: 7 10 Eating plenty of fiber, such as is found in fruit, vegetables, cereals and wholemeal bread Drinking plenty of liquids to soften stools. Adults should aim to drink two litres or more each day. It is best to avoid alcoholic drinks as they can cause dehydration. Not putting off defecation, which can lead to bigger and harder stools forming, which may exacerbate the problem\n\nThere are further clinical treatments available for people who do not respond to topical therapy and home treatment measures. These may include: 7 14\n\nAlso known as botulinum toxin, botox, which temporarily paralyzes muscles for up to three months, can be injected into the anal sphincter. This may be done without anesthesia or sedation. Botox treatment may lead to temporary, mild anal leakage of gas or feces.\n\nThe type of surgery recommended for treating an anal fissure is normally sphincterotomy, which aims to relax the anal sphincter. A surgeon cuts the muscle in order to loosen the anal muscle, therefore improving blood supply and aiding healing. Incontinence is a possible complication from this surgery, so it is only recommended to people whose symptoms have persisted despite medicine for at least one to three months. Anal fissure surgery recovery time varies from person to person.",
    "complications": "Complications of anal fissure may include: 15 16 Chronic anal fissure: the tear fails to heal. Over time, this can cause extensive scar tissue at the site of the fissure. Incontinence: This may result from surgery to treat chronic anal fissure. Anal fistulas: Small tunnels form between the anal canal and surrounding organs, usually other parts of the bowel. Anal stenosis: the anal canal becomes abnormally narrowed either due to spasm of the anal sphincter or contraction of the resultant scar tissue.",
    "anal_fissure_in_babies_and_children": "Anal fissures can occur in children of any age, but are most common in toddlers. The infant may scream when defecating and have bright red blood in their feces. A common problem of anal fissure in children is that they will often deliberately avoid defecating, which may cause hardening of feces, leading to repeated re-tearing of the old fissure and preventing healing. Even once the fissure has healed, a child may still be fearful of defecating. To break this cycle, it is important to give the baby or child  both suitable feces-softening medication and laxatives, under medical supervision, to ensure regular defecation. The correct dose varies from child to child and may be gradually adjusted so that the child consistently produces large, soft stools. 17 Good to know: Rarely, anal fissures in children could indicate sexual abuse, especially if other causes such as hard feces are not present. 6",

    "anal_fissure_faqs": "Q: Are there home remedies for anal fissure? A: Yes, there are several measures for home treatment that may help. These include: Sitz baths or hip baths, which involve sitting in plain, non-soapy water after defecation to keep the area clean Sitting on a warm heating pad or warm water bottle is thought to promote healing as heat increases blood flow to the area However, medical attention should always be sought where there is bleeding from the anus. It may indicate other conditions which must receive prompt treatment to ensure the best outcome, such as anal cancer. Q: Anal fissure or herpes: how can one tell the difference? A: It is possible to get herpes, a sexually transmitted infection, in the anal area. This can bring about what feels like a fissure around the anus and may be mistaken for one. Anal fissure causes burning pain and bleeding during defecation. Herpes causes blisters, itching and pain around the anus, but not especially while defecating, and lesions from herpes are unlikely to bleed. Herpes may also cause flu-like symptoms and other associated problems such as pain with urination. Anal herpes normally has a history of sexual exposure to the herpes virus. Read more about Herpes » . Q: Are anal fissures dangerous? A: No, anal fissures by themselves aren’t normally dangerous. However, they can be associated with more serious diseases, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease. Also, cancer of the anus may mimic an anal fissure. Complications of an anal fissure may include: 15 16 Chronic anal fissure: the tear fails to heal. Over time, this can cause extensive scar tissue at the site of the fissure.

Anal stenosis: the anal canal becomes abnormally narrowed either due to spasm of the anal sphincter or contraction of the resultant scar tissue. Q: Are anal fissures painful? A: Anal fissures usually cause pain during bowel movements that is often severe. It has been described as feeling like passing broken glass. Painkillers and efforts to soften stool, such as through medication or a high-fiber diet, can improve this symptom. Q: Do anal fissures bleed? A: Yes, most people with an anal fissure will notice a small amount of bright red blood either in their stools or on the toilet paper. More significant bleeding is indicative of symptoms being caused by another condition. Q: How do you know if a fissure is healing? A: Most anal fissures heal with home treatment after a few days or a weeks. These are known as acute anal fissures. Pain during bowel movements usually goes away within a couple of days after the start of treatment. If pain and blood in the stool persists longer than six weeks, then it is known as a chronic anal fissure, which may not heal with home treatment alone, and may need medical treatment. 18"

    "what_is_anaphylaxis": "Anaphylaxis, also known as an anaphylactic reaction, is an extreme allergic reaction affecting multiple groups of organs of the body. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical treatment. It is characterized by rapidly-developing, life-threatening problems affecting one or several of the following: The airway Breathing Blood circulation Symptoms usually begin within minutes of exposure to a trigger substance, but may less commonly occur only after several hours and tend to worsen quickly. Typical symptoms include an itchy red rash, coughing or wheezing, difficulty breathing and, eventually, fainting. Triggers for anaphylaxis are different from person to person, but are often everyday things such as insect stings or certain foods, such as nuts, shellfish or eggs. It does not occur on the first exposure to an allergen, but on subsequent exposures. People at high risk are recommended to carry around an emergency anaphylaxis kit with an adrenaline injection pen, especially when traveling to areas where medical help is not readily available. If treated quickly and appropriately, most people recover well after an episode of anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic reactions tend to be more common in children and teenagers, though adults can also have reactions when they are exposed to triggers. The onset of an anaphylactic allergy can occur at any age.",

The most common early symptoms of anaphylaxis include: 1 Itchy skin, sometimes developing into hives – a rash of raised, pink or red areas known as wheals General reddening of the skin Wheezing, hoarseness and a tight chest, leading to difficulty breathing Swelling of the lips, tongue and throat, known as angioedema Irritation and inflammation of the eyes and nasal passages Swelling of the eyes, hands and feet Dizziness Nausea and vomiting, especially if the trigger was eaten As anaphylaxis rapidly progresses to its more severe form, anaphylactic shock, other symptoms may include: 1 3 A sense of impending doom A fast or thumping heart Stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting Advanced symptoms of anaphylaxis include: 1 3 A high-pitched wheezing sound, known as stridor Fast, shallow breathing or complete inability to breathe Bluish skin on the lips and tongue Confusion, agitation and anxiety A sudden feeling of weakness or dizziness Loss of consciousness\n\nAnaphylaxis may be divided into two main types: 1 Uniphasic reactions have symptoms that get rapidly worse, but once treated, the symptoms go and then do not return. Biphasic reactions may be mild or severe to start with and then appear to disappear before symptoms increasingly get worse. Good to know: Rarely, anaphylactic reactions may last for hours or even days before fully resolving.",
    "causes": "Anaphylaxis is an extreme allergic response. Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat. These substances are called allergens or triggers. Some people are sensitive to one or more allergens. Good to know: Even a very small amount of an allergen can trigger an allergic reaction. 4 In the case of anaphylaxis, the body’s allergic reaction goes into overdrive. White blood cells – usually involved in helping the body combat infection – release chemical substances, such as histamine, that lead to strong inflammation-like reactions in the parts of the body affected. This sets off a series of events which cause the body to experience problems with and potentially even lose control of its vital functions, the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system. The blood vessels widen, which leads to a drop in blood pressure. The tissues in the airways swell, which causes difficulty breathing and may completely block the airways. If air cannot reach the lungs, the blood cannot get essential oxygen. Oxygen-rich blood is needed so that all cells and organs, such as the brain and heart, can work properly. The heart muscle needs oxygen so that it can pump blood around the body. Once one major organ system starts to falter, the others become strained, potentially leading to failure of multiple organs. Organ failure may be life-threatening. 3\n\nThe trigger for anaphylactic reactions vary from person to person. Some of the most common triggers include: 5 6 Certain foods, including nuts, shellfish, eggs, some fruits Insect stings, particularly wasp stings and bee stings Natural latex, also known as rubber, often found in condoms and cleaning gloves Certain medications, including some antibiotics such as penicillin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. aspirin Contrast agents: special dyes used in some medical tests such as CT angiograms General anesthetic In some cases of anaphylaxis, no specific cause for this severe allergic reaction can be found This is called idiopathic anaphylaxis. 7 8\n\nSome factors that may increase the risk of anaphylaxis include: 9 A previous anaphylactic reaction Allergies or asthma Certain other conditions, including mastocytosis, an abnormal accumulation of mast cells, which can release histamine and other substances during allergic reactions",
    "anaphylaxis_diagnosis": "Treatment is not delayed in order to carry out diagnostic tests, since an anaphylactic reaction is an emergency, and anyone with presumed anaphylaxis is treated as such. After life-saving emergency treatment has been started and symptoms have been brought under control, blood tests can be done to confirm anaphylaxis or rule out other causes of the symptoms. One particularly important test measures mast cell tryptase, a chemical released by the immune system in a severe allergic reaction. This blood test should be done as soon as possible and no later than four hours from the onset of symptoms. 3 10 Good to know: The definition of anaphylaxis used by clinicians varies. Some clinicians take the term to mean only very severe symptoms, whereas others use it to describe cases with less severe symptoms. All definitions require the presence of symptoms involving the airways, breathing or circulation. 11",
    "treatment": "Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening emergency and needs immediate treatment. If it is suspected that a person is experiencing anaphylaxis then an ambulance must be called at once and the person transported to the nearest emergency department. 3 Good to know: Even if symptoms subside, a trip to the emergency room is still required, as sometimes an anaphylactic reaction can be biphasic, meaning symptoms may go away after a short time, but then return and rapidly get worse again after an hour or so.\n\nWhile waiting for medical help, first aid measures should be taken immediately, including: 3 12\n\nAdrenaline should be injected immediately, whenever possible. Many people who are susceptible to anaphylaxis will carry an adrenaline auto-injector, also known as an EpiPen, adrenaline pen or epinephrine. This is a pre-filled syringe with a needle that can be injected by the person having the anaphylactic reaction or by a bystander who knows how to use it. If there is no response to the initial injection, it is recommended to give a further adrenaline dose after five minutes, if the available autoinjector pen contains a second dose. 13 Adrenaline is effective very soon after being administered and wears off quite quickly. Good to know: Unless specifically instructed otherwise by a medical professional, adrenaline should be injected only in the middle of the outer side of the thigh and can be injected through clothing if necessary in an emergency. If adrenaline is accidentally injected into another area, get emergency medical treatment immediately. If injecting a young child who may move during the injection, their leg should be firmly held in place to limit their movement before and during the injection.\n\nA person in anaphylactic shock should be placed in a comfortable position. Depending on the symptoms experienced, different positions will be advised: A person who feels faint, due to low blood pressure, should lie flat with their legs raised. Sitting or standing may cause additional heart problems A person with airway and breathing problems may prefer to sit up, as this makes breathing easier An unconscious person who is still breathing should be placed on their side in the recovery position 15 A pregnant person should lie on their left side to avoid caval compression, which is when a large vein that carries oxygen to the heart is squeezed, which is more likely when lying on the back or on the right side and can lead to low blood pressure\n\nRemoving the trigger for anaphylaxis is not always possible, but may involve, for example: Removing the stinger from a bee sting. Early removal is more important than how the sting is removed. Rinsing mouth to remove traces of a food allergen. However, attempts to make a person vomit after an anaphylactic reaction triggered by a food allergy can lead to other severe problems. This is therefore not recommended.\n\nIf the person is unresponsive and not breathing, CPR should be performed until the emergency services arrive. CPR is unlikely to make a person’s heart start beating again if it has stopped. However, it will pump some blood around the body, supplying organs and, most importantly, the brain with oxygen. Good to know: If untrained, a helping person doesn’t need to spend lots of time trying to find a pulse. If a pulse cannot be found quickly and the affected person is unresponsive and not breathing, CPR should be begun without any delay. One can use hands-only CPR if no second helper is in sight or one is not feeling comfortable doing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Hands-Only CPR is CPR without mouth-to-mouth ventilation. The important part is keeping the heart artificially pumping by any means necessary. It involves pushing hard, deep and fast in the center of the chest to a regular rhythm, about twice a second. Some doctors suggested doing this to the beat of the popular song Stayin’ Alive, as one thereby mimics the recommended 100 pumps per minute.\n\nPeople with presumed anaphylaxis are treated in the emergency department. The specifics of treatment depend on how well or unwell overall the person is who experiences an anaphylactic reaction. Treatment may include: 3 16 Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, usually injected into the thigh muscle and sometimes given multiple times or, in rarer cases, via an intravenous drip. Intravenous fluids to raise blood pressure Oxygen and bronchodilators: inhaled medications used in cases of persistent respiratory problems, that help relax the muscles in the lungs to allow increased airflow to the lungs Steroids and antihistamines In severe cases, a breathing tube and breathing support through a ventilator may be necessary until the immune reaction settles.",
    "prevention_and_management": "If a person has had an anaphylactic reaction, they are very likely to have another if exposed to the same allergen again. Subsequent episodes of anaphylaxis are often worse than the first one. There are several ways to prevent and manage the possibility of having another anaphylactic reaction: 17\n\nIt is important to take steps to avoid exposure to triggers. A person who has experienced anaphylaxis will likely be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to identify allergy triggers and for assessment and advice about how to avoid them in the future. Good to know: Some people who have had an anaphylactic episode in response to common substances or medication choose to wear a piece of jewelry, often a bracelet that has their allergy engraved on it, to direct medical staff in the case of emergencies. 3\n\nAn epinephrine autoinjector pen should be carried at all times. They contain a prescribed single or double 13 dose of anaphylaxis medication that is injected into the thigh during an anaphylactic emergency. A doctor will explain to the person affected how to use this. It is also important that other people in close contact, such as family members, also know how to use the autoinjector. People at high risk of severe reactions should also have an anaphylaxis action plan for their school or workplace, which includes education on the prevention of exposure and how to act in cases of anaphylactic reaction. Emergency anaphylaxis kits can also be prescribed in some cases. It is recommended that these include: 18 An adrenaline injection, also known as an epinephrine pen, which is the most important. This works rapidly to reverse many severe symptoms caused by anaphylactic shock, most importantly: Low blood pressure Rapid or abnormal heart rate Poor circulation Swelling Asthma H1 antihistamines, such as loratadine, which are particularly effective for treating skin symptoms and reducing swelling, as a supporting medication to epinephrine. H2 antihistamines, such as ranitidine, which can also help with cardiovascular symptoms alongside other medications. This also reduces stomach acid, which is produced increasingly due to the body’s excess of histamine; therefore H2 antihistamines may also reduce stomach discomfort. Good to know: A combination of H1 and H2 antihistamine is commonly used, as this has been shown to be more effective than treatment with H1 antihistamine alone. 20\n\nFor some people, it is possible to undergo allergen immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or hyposensitization therapy, which means the body is very slowly – over months or years – exposed to the trigger responsible for their allergy. This causes the immune system to get used to the trigger gradually, helping to reduce the severity of the allergic reaction in the future. 21",
    "other_names_used_for_anaphylaxis": "anaphylactic shock anaphylactic reaction",
    "faqs": "Q: Anaphylaxis vs anaphylactoid reaction – what is the difference? A: Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition triggered by a wide range of allergens and affecting multiple organ systems. It does not occur on the first exposure to an allergen, but on subsequent exposures. Anaphylactoid reactions – sometimes also called non-immunologic anaphylaxis – have the same symptoms as anaphylactic reactions, but they do not involve or require previous exposure to the allergen. Rather, they occur on first exposure. Anaphylactoid reactions are sometimes seen in certain medical treatments. These may include reactions to NSAIDs, local anesthetics, cancer treatment with monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy. 22 Q: Allergic reaction vs anaphylaxis – what is the difference? A: An allergy is an immune response to something that the body mistakenly perceives as a threat, such as pollen or animal dander. In most cases, people with allergies develop mild to moderate symptoms, which develop locally, e.g. as a skin rash or tearing eyes and a runny nose. Much more rarely, exposure to a triggering allergen can cause an anaphylactic reaction. This happens when a person’s immune system over-releases chemicals, leading to an entire-body reaction as opposed to a local allergy reaction. Anaphylaxis involves the respiratory and/or cardiovascular system, which can be life threatening. Q: How long does anaphylaxis take? A: Initial symptoms typically develop rapidly, reaching peak severity within 3 to 30 minutes. Symptoms may disappear after one or two epinephrine injections. Less commonly, they may then return after a period of one to eight hours, which is known as a biphasic response. Rarely, protracted anaphylaxis may occur, in which symptoms persist for days. Q: How long does recovery after anaphylactic shock take? A: It may take a few days to fully recover after treatment. Many people will feel quite unwell and drained for up to about a week. Q: Will Benadryl stop anaphylaxis? A: No, emergency treatment must be sought immediately as anaphylaxis is life-threatening. Antihistamine pills such as diphenhydramine, brand name Benadryl, are not sufficient to treat anaphylaxis. They can help to relieve allergy symptoms, but work too slowly and ineffectively on life-threatening symptoms to prevent serious complications from anaphylactic shock."

    "what_is_anemia": "Anemia is the general name for a condition where the body either cannot make enough healthy red blood cells and/or has too little hemoglobin, the substance that enables red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body. 1\n\nThere are many different types of anemia. These include, but are not limited to: 2 3 4 5 Iron deficiency anemia, the most common type of anemia Megaloblastic anemia, often caused by a vitamin B12 deficiency or folic acid deficiency Aplastic anemia, caused by damage or dysfunction in bone marrow cells Hemolytic anemia, caused by red blood cells being destroyed at an increased rate Medically speaking, anemia is broadly classified as macrocytic, microcytic or normocytic, depending on the size and volume of the red blood cells (erythrocytes): 6 7 Macrocytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are larger than normal. This includes anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency. Microcytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are smaller than normal. This includes anemia caused by iron deficiency, thalassemia or sickle cell disease. Normocytic anemia. In this category of anemia, the red blood cells are normal in size, but fewer than normal in number. This includes anemia caused by chronic conditions, e.g. kidney disease. Regardless of the type or cause, common symptoms of anemia include: 8 Tiredness and lethargy Breathlessness Faintness Headaches There may also be other symptoms specific to the type of anemia being experienced. The treatment recommended for anemia depends on the underlying cause. In cases of iron or vitamin deficiency, treatment will typically involve dietary changes and sometimes the use of supplements or medications. In less common types of anemia, as well as severe cases, more complex approaches, such as blood transfusions, may be needed. 9 10 11 Find out more about how vitamin deficiency tests work. The outlook depends on the type, cause and severity of anemia, as well as the age and overall health of the person; but with appropriate and timely treatment, recovery or effective management can be expected in many cases. 12 If left untreated, anemia can lead to complications, including reduced ability to function, lower quality of life, lung problems and even heart failure. 13 12 It is important to consult a medical practitioner without delay, should the condition be suspected.",
    "types": "There are a number of different types of anemia . These include the following:\n\nIron deficiency anemia is caused by a lack of iron in the body , leading to reduced levels of sufficiently functioning red blood cells. Iron deficiency can be caused by a variety of factors and conditions, including internal bleeding, pregnancy, heavy menstruation, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a lack of iron in one’s diet. 9\n\nMegaloblastic anemia is a type of macrocytic anemia that can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or lack of folic acid (folate) . This is most often due to a dietary deficiency or malabsorption, e.g. as in pernicious anemia, where the body cannot absorb sufficient amounts of vitamin B12. 3\n\nAplastic anemia is a consequence of damage or dysfunction in the bone marrow cells, causing them to produce fewer red blood cells than needed. This may be the result of a number of conditions, including infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders, as well as certain substances and cancer treatments. Rarely, aplastic anemia may run in families. Examples of hereditary conditions that can lead to aplastic anemia include Fanconi anemia and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. 4\n\nHemolytic anemia occurs as a result of red blood cells being destroyed more quickly than usual. This can be caused by a number of different conditions, some of which may run in families. There are many types of hemolytic anemia. Two examples include thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, both of which are hereditary. 5\n\nThalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production and function of hemoglobin , causing red blood cells to break down more easily than normal. The condition may be mild or severe. 14 Read more about Thalassemia »\n\nThis is a common, severe, form of sickle cell disease – a group of conditions that cause hemoglobin to be abnormally shaped and red blood cells to break down more easily than normal.

For example, iron deficiency anemia may cause wounds to heal slowly and brittle nails. Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia may cause pins and needles, confusion, and depression. Good to know: In the early stages of anemia, some people may not experience symptoms. 18 People experiencing possible symptoms of anemia can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "anemia_causes": "There are many possible causes of anemia. These include: 9 19 Dietary deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin B12 , folic acid and iron Malabsorption of nutrients, e.g. in celiac disease , Crohn’s disease Substantial blood loss, e.g. from heavy menstruation or inflammatory bowel disease Bone marrow problems and leukemia Certain chronic conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis , kidney disease (anemia of chronic disease) Certain genetic disorders, e.g. thalassemia and sickle cell disease Certain infections, e.g. malaria Certain medications and therapies, e.g. some types of painkillers, antibiotics, drugs for hyperthyroidism 17 and cancer treatments 18 Periods where the body needs more energy than usual, such as puberty and pregnancy",
    "diagnosis": "As the first step, a doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. They may then order blood tests to check: 19 18 Hemoglobin levels and red blood cell size (complete blood count) Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels Kidney function The doctor may also ask for the following tests to be done: 19 18 Urine tests Stool (feces) tests A bone marrow biopsy, removing a small sample for examination A gastroscopy or colonoscopy to examine the digestive tract As effective treatment of anemia depends on identifying the cause, the doctor will attempt to establish what this is. Further tests may be required if the cause is not clear.",

    "condition": "Aortic Dissection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/aortic-dissection/",
    "what_is_an_aortic_dissection": "An aortic dissection is a serious condition in which a tear or split occurs in the inner layer of the aorta. The aorta is the largest blood vessel branching from the heart and supplies blood and oxygen to the entire body. If a tear occurs, blood is able to pass through the opening. This  can cause the inner and middle layers of the aorta to separate, or dissect. 1 The condition is relatively rare, but most common in people between the ages of 50 and 65, tending to affect men more often than women. The main symptom is pain in the chest, upper back or abdomen. An aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. In most cases, surgery will be necessary to repair the blood vessel.",
    "aortic_dissection_symptoms": "The main symptom of aortic dissection is a sudden, intense pain in the chest and upper back, commonly described as a shearing or ripping sensation. This pain may spread to the back, arms or legs, depending on the location of the dissection. Other symptoms may include: Shortness of breath Cold hands or feet Nausea Sweating Dizziness General weakness People experiencing an aortic dissection may also lose consciousness, depending on the amount of blood that is lost from the blood vessel. Symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of other heart conditions, including heart attack and stroke . If you are worried you may suffer from an aortic dissection, try using the free Ada App to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "causes": "An aortic dissection typically occurs in a weakened area of the aorta. According to the Stanford classification system, there are two types of the condition, each defined by which part of the aorta is affected: Type A: Tear occurs close to where the aorta exits the heart or in the upper aorta, known as the ascending aorta. May affect the upper aorta only or the upper aorta, as well as the lower aorta. Even if only a very small section of the upper aorta is affected and a large area of the lower aorta, this will still be classed as type A. Type B: Tear occurs in the lower aorta, known as the descending aorta. The DeBakey classification system, on the other hand, identifies three types of aortic dissection: 2 Type I: Tear occurs in the ascending and descending aorta. Type II: Tear occurs in the ascending aorta only. Type III: Tear occurs in the descending aorta only. The type of aortic dissection being experienced may affect the treatment options available.\n\nAortic dissection is more common in men than in women, and people between the ages of 50 and 65 are most at risk. Other risk factors include: High blood pressure Smoking High cholesterol levels People who already have a weakened or enlarged aorta – an aortic aneurysm – or who have experienced angina, a heart attack or stroke are also at an increased risk of aortic dissection. Less common causes are cocaine use and chest injuries, such as those experienced as a result of a car accident. Certain genetic conditions are also known to increase the risk of aortic dissection; these include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Turner's syndrome.",
    "diagnosing_aortic_dissection": "The diagnosis is made by a doctor based on the symptoms and appearance of the affected person. In an emergency situation, an ultrasound scan may be carried out immediately to confirm the diagnosis. Other tests that may help to confirm the diagnosis include: Electrocardiogram (ECG) X-rays of the chest and abdomen CT scan (computed tomography) MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging scan)",
    "aortic_dissection_treatment": "A type A, or type I and type II, aortic dissection is a medical emergency requiring surgery to repair the damaged aorta before complications can occur. Typically, a valve-sparing aortic root replacement, also known as a David procedure, will be performed. 3 This procedure preserves the aortic valve, grafting it to a new section of aortic tissue. In cases where the aortic valve is destroyed completely, it will typically be replaced with an artificial valve. This is major surgery carrying the risk of complications. A type B, or type III, aortic dissection may not necessarily require surgery. Medication, such as beta blockers - these may be used to manage blood pressure - or a less invasive type of surgery, elective endovascular repair, may be performed to redirect blood flow away from the dissection. 4 After initial treatment for both types of aortic dissection has been carried out, long-term use of blood pressure-lowering medication will typically be required. Many people will take this medication for the rest of their lives. Hospital visits, which may include CT and MRI scans, to check-up on the condition may also be necessary. 1",
    "aortic_dissection_complications": "If effective treatment is not received, an aortic dissection can be life-threatening. This is commonly due to internal bleeding, but can also result from damage to an organ – stemming from a lack of blood flow to the organ – stroke, or damage to the heart’s aortic valve. 1",
    "aortic_dissection_prevention": "Preventing an aortic dissection typically involves keeping blood pressure within a healthy range. To do this, a variety of lifestyle changes are recommended: Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals, fruits and vegetables, and low in sugar, fat and carbohydrates Exercising regularly Maintaining a healthy weight Quitting smoking or not starting in the first place Avoiding drugs, such as cocaine, and other stimulants Preventive measures are particularly recommended for people within the at-risk groups for an aortic dissection. In combination with lifestyle changes, people with a history of high blood pressure should also take care to take their prescribed medication.",

    "what_are_aphthous_ulcers": "Aphthous mouth ulcers (aphthae) are a common variety of ulcer that form on the mucous membranes , typically in the oral cavity (mouth). Other names for aphthous ulcers include aphthous stomatitis and canker sores. 1\n\nAphthous ulcers are generally round in shape and form in the soft areas of the mouth such as the inside of the lips, the cheeks, or the underside of the tongue. They are benign, non-contagious, and can occur as single ulcers or in clusters. In most instances, aphthous ulcers are recurrent – a condition known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) – with each episode normally lasting for between 7 and 10 days. 2 The cause of the condition is unclear, and there is no cure, but treatment options are available to treat the pain the ulcers can cause.",
    "what_type": "There are three main types: 3\n\nThese are the most common variety. They are small in size – usually less than 5 mm in diameter – and can form as a single ulcer or in a cluster. They typically do not cause much pain.\n\nThese are less common, are generally 5 mm or larger and form singularly or in a pair. They can be painful, especially when eating or drinking, and last anywhere between two weeks and a number of months.\n\nThese can occur when multiple pinpoint lesions fuse together and form large, irregularly shaped ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers are so called because of their similarity in appearance to herpes, however, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by the herpes simplex virus.",
    "symptoms": "Aside from the ulcers (aphthae) themselves, the condition has very few symptoms. Before ulceration occurs, some individuals may begin to feel a burning or itching sensation inside the mouth, which can be painful. Once the ulceration occurs, localized pain of various degrees is often present.\n\nThe ulcers (aphthae, canker sores or mouth sores) are normally shallow and begin as pale yellow in colour, generally turning grey as the condition develops. They may be ringed with red or appear fully red when inflamed. Depending on where the ulcers are located, eating, drinking and talking may become uncomfortable.",
    "causes": "The precise cause or causes of aphthous ulcers (canker sores) are unknown , however, it is thought that ulceration is brought about by one or a combination of external triggers . It may also be partly genetic, with 40 percent of people who experience ulcers having a family history of the condition. Aphthous mouth ulcers affect around one in five people at least occasionally and most commonly begin to appear between the ages of 10 and 19. Possible triggers of aphthous ulcers include : 4 Emotional stress Minor injury to the inside of the mouth, for example from cuts, burns or bites while eating, dental work, hard brushing or ill-fitting dentures Familial tendency Sodium lauryl sulfate – an active ingredient in some toothpastes and mouthwashes; this compound is not proven as a trigger, but is known to prolong the time needed for ulcers to heal Certain food and drinks, including coffee, chocolate, eggs and cheese, as well as acidic or spicy foods A deficiency of certain vitamins and/or minerals including zinc, B-12, folate and iron that may present with anemia An allergic reaction to oral bacteria Using, as well as quitting, the use of tobacco products Hormonal changes associated with pregnancy Having a weakened immune system, due to certain chronic conditions (Immunodeficiency) Stress is a common cause of mouth ulcers. Although stress does not directly cause mouth ulcers, it does increase the chances of developing them and can affect their healing process. 5 6 Mouth ulcers can also cause stress by affecting how and what the affected person can eat and drink.\n\nSome medications are also linked to the development of ulcers , however, they may not always cause the aphthous variety of ulcers. They include: 7 Nicorandil, a drug used to treat angina pectoris, a heart condition Ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medicines Oral nicotine replacement therapy opposed to patch replacement therapy Medicines such as aspirin if left to dissolve in the mouth instead of being swallowed Illegal drugs such as cocaine Very rarely, recurrent ulceration can be a possible sign of several serious diseases, including: Crohn's disease Celiac disease Behcet’s disease HIV/AIDS The ulcers that are symptomatic of these disorders, however, are technically not aphthous but closely resemble aphthous ulcers and are therefore called aphthous-like ulceration. People who experience recurrent outbreaks of ulcers or ulcers that are slow to heal, especially painful or accompanied by other symptoms should see a doctor as soon as possible.",
    "diagnosing_aphthous_ulcers": "In most cases, especially when the condition is not recurrent, diagnosis will be based around medical examination and an investigation of an individual’s medical history. A proper evaluation and diagnostic work-up of recurrent ulceration is important due to its links to other, more serious conditions such as celiac disease , inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease or conditions causing a weakened immune system, such as HIV/AIDS . The diagnostic process may involve the ruling out of these conditions through blood tests or, less often, using a  gastroscopy or colonoscopy, possibly also obtaining tissue samples. 8 The course the diagnostic work-up will take will depend on the doctor’s evaluation of the severity of an individual’s condition and the presence of any other symptoms.",
    "complications": "Although most mouth ulcers will clear up within two weeks, in very rare cases they may become infected with bacteria. This usually only happens in severe cases, where the ulcerated area is extensive. In the case of a secondary bacterial infection, an antibiotic mouthwash and a means of managing the pain and discomfort may be prescribed. In some cases, oral antibiotics may also be needed (see the section below on treatment ). 8",
    "aphthous_ulcers_treatment": "There is no cure for aphthous ulcers, aphthae or canker sores, but there are ways to manage the symptoms. In the majority of cases, the ulcers will disappear without treatment and avoiding hard or irritative foods, like e.g. pineapples, applying cold substances to the affected area and if needed using numbing preparations, like topical lidocaine or benzocaine will be enough to manage the pain. When further treatment is required, there are several possible options, with the chosen route depending on a doctor’s judgement of how well each may work, based on the location and severity of the ulceration, and the affected person’s general health. 9\n\nOver-the-counter, topical anti-inflammatory pastes applied directly to the problem area may be effective in managing the symptoms of aphthous ulcers (aphthae/canker sores), particularly of the minor variety. These pastes should be applied between two and four times per day, please follow the specific recommendations  of your pharmacy or doctor.\n\nThe use of an antiseptic mouthwash e.g. containing chlorhexidine, twice per day or as per your doctor’s recommendations can be part of a treatment regimen for aphthous ulcers. 10 In rare cases a doctor may prescribe topical or oral antibiotics, such as tetracycline or minocycline, which can be effective in treating ulcers. They are typically administered in mouthwash form, with the antibiotic being dissolved in water, swilled around the mouth, and spat out. This may be necessary several times per day for a number of days.\n\nOther treatments may include topical or, rarely, oral steroids, typically used when the ulcers are unresponsive to other treatment methods; silver nitrate;; other local anaesthetics/numbing agents; and nutritional supplements (containing folate, zinc or vitamin B-12 , for example). 4\n\nThere are a number of popular home remedies for aphthous ulcers, including: 4 Rinsing the mouth with salt water Rinsing the mouth with a solution of baking soda/sodium bicarbonate and water Application of milk of magnesia to the ulcer after rinsing Application of ice chips or cubes to the affected area to reduce swelling Teething ointments containing local anesthetic to manage pain and discomfort Reducing stress Avoiding hard foods or foods that may scratch the interior of the mouth Nutritional supplements such as Vitamin B-12 capsules, Vitamin D capsules, folate tablets, or zinc tablets can also reduce the risk of developing canker sores.",
    "aphthous_ulcers_prevention": "To lessen the likelihood of an ulcer outbreak, especially for those with a history of recurrent aphthous ulcers (aphthae), a number of measures can be taken. Avoiding foods that may trigger ulceration in the individual person Focussing on a healthy, balanced diet containing sufficient amounts of nutrients and vitamins Maintaining good dental hygiene and using a soft toothbrush to avoid irritation Reducing stress and getting plenty of sleep",
    "aphthous_ulcers_prognosis": "Aphthous ulcers (aphthae) are generally non-serious and will go away without any particular treatment. Ulcers that heal on their own within a few weeks are not an indication of oral cancer and are non-infectious. The ulcers, however, can be very painful and inconveniencing, especially if they are recurrent. Many people will find that they stop getting aphthous ulcers as they get older.",
    "aphthous_ulcers_faqs": "Q: Are there any home remedies for aphthous ulcers (aphthae)? A: There are a number of popular home remedies for aphthous ulcers, including: 11 12 Rinsing the mouth with a warm salt water/saline solution Applying a small amount of milk of magnesia to the ulcer after rinsing Sucking ice chips or cubes to reduce swelling Teething ointments containing local anesthetic Avoiding hard foods or foods that may scratch the interior of the mouth or may cause irritation due to their acidic nature, like e.g. pineapple, lemons, oranges, or tomatoes while the ulcer sore is present Reducing stress Q: Can I get aphthous ulcers (aphthae) in the genital region? A: Yes, although oral aphthous ulcers are most common, aphthous ulcers may also appear in the genital region. This is most common in women, with the ulcers normally forming on the vulva or adjacent skin. The ulcers are in most cases of similar appearance to the oral version and may be similarly painful. 13 Q: Is it safe to have oral sex if the performing partner has mouth ulcers? A: Mouth ulcers, because they are breaks in the skin inside the mouth, increase the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections such as herpes, gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. This risk can be reduced if the receiving partner wears a condom or if a dental dam is used. 14 Good oral care and proper oral hygiene techniques can reduce the chances of developing some mouth ulcers or other breaks in the oral skin. Q: Can smoking cause mouth ulcers? A: Smoking can make mouth ulcers worse. The nicotine in cigarette smoke may reduce the amount of blood that flows to the mouth and gums, which may then slow down the healing process for any ulcers, cuts, or scrapes inside the mouth. 15 Slow healing means that the painful period is prolonged and increases the chance of infection. At the same time, it seems to be the case that smoking may reduce the chance of developing mouth ulcers because it hardens the surface of the epithelial cells in the mouth. 16 However, smoking has many other harmful effects on the body and should be avoided. Q: What is recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS)? A: Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is the name given to the condition of experiencing frequent bouts of aphthous mouth ulcers (aphthae). Although a single bout of aphthous stomatitis is possible, recurrent episodes are the norm. 17 Episodes of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) typically occur at intervals of between a few months to a few days and last for between 7 and 10 days at a time. Q: What is the relationship between aphthous ulcers (aphthae) and Behçet syndrome? A: Behçet syndrome is characterized by inflammation in various areas of the body. Behçet syndrome is by some experts considered an autoimmune disorder and by others an autoinflammatory disorder. Autoinflammatory disorders, like autoimmune disorders, are caused by an overactive immune system attacking the body’s tissues and causing inflammation. 18 One of Behçet syndrome’s distinguishing symptoms is the presence of aphthous ulceration in the oral cavity (mouth), as well as ulceration on other parts of the body, including the genitals and additionally often presents inflammation of part of the eye, called uveitis. Although mouth ulcers are a symptom of Behçet syndrome, mouth ulcers are common, and Behçet Syndrome is rare. Only very few people who experience mouth ulcers are affected by Behçet syndrome. 19 Q: What is complex aphthosis? A: Complex aphthosis is the given name for the condition of having almost constant oral aphthae or recurrent oral and genital aphthae without having Behçet syndrome. When complex aphthosis is suspected, medical attention should be sought for diagnosis and treatment. 20 Q: Can systemic lupus erythematosus cause mouth ulcers? A: Mouth ulcers can affect about half of all people with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder. Lupus-related ulcers are not aphthous mouth ulcers, and while they may be painful in some people, they are often not painful for many others. They commonly affect the roof of the mouth, but can also appear on the gums, lips, and inside of the cheeks. They resemble aphthous mouth ulcers, being red sores, but may also be more varied in presentation, e.g. some may have a whitish, radiating halo. 21 People with lupus may also experience ulcers in the nose. Q: Can gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD/GORD) cause mouth ulcers? A: Gastroesophageal reflux disease , commonly known as acid reflux, is a condition in which gastric acid leaks up into the esophagus or, less likely, also into the oral cavity/mouth. If acid enters the mouth, GERD can cause the erosion of tooth enamel and an acidic taste. Mouth ulcers can develop. GERD may also cause a feeling of a sore throat and, in some cases, throat and esophageal inflammation and ulcers may develop. If GERD causes ulcers, they will more likely be found at the back of the mouth, the back of the tongue, and the back of the throat, because of the path of the acid coming up from the stomach. 22 Q: Can chemotherapy cause mouth ulcers? A: Yes, chemotherapy often causes mouth ulcers. Chemotherapy can cause  inflammation of the mucosal lining of the throat and mouth, leading to sores in the mouth. Technically, if occurring in the mouth, the painful condition and ulcers caused by chemotherapy are known as stomatitis and may be  related to mucositis, a condition that affects a larger area of the digestive tract’s mucosal lining. For more information, read this resource on the side effects of chemotherapy . Q: Can Hepatitis C cause mouth ulcers? A: Yes, Hepatitis C or its treatment can sometimes cause mouth ulcers and other mouth conditions, such as tooth decay or a sensitive mouth by e.g. affecting saliva production and causing a dry mouth. Because Hepatitis C is a complex condition, people who have Hepatitis C should consult their care teams regarding any concerns before starting any treatment program. Q: Are mouth ulcers a sign of cancer? A: A mouth ulcer that does not clear up is sometimes a sign of oral cancer. However, very few mouth ulcers are a sign of cancer. Mouth ulcers associated with cancer are generally solitary rather than in clusters and appear without any apparent cause. 23 If a mouth ulcer persists longer than three weeks, causes symptoms the person can’t handle like not being able to eat or drink sufficiently due to pain, and/or does not respond to treatment , the affected person should see a doctor . Other symptoms of oral cancer may include: 24 White or red patches on the gums, cheek lining, or tonsils that are persistent or don’t get better Persistent mouth pain A lump in the cheek Persistent throat pain The sensation of something stuck in the throat Difficulty swallowing, chewing, moving the jaw, or moving the tongue Q: Can aphthous mouth ulcers occur on the gums? A: Yes, mouth ulcers can affect the gums. They may also affect the tongue, the inside of the cheeks, and the inside of the lips. Q: What are the differences between cold sores and canker sores? A: Cold sores, also known as herpes labialis , are caused by Herpes Simplex Virus 1 or 2. Aphthous mouth ulcers are not caused by viruses. Cold sores primarily affect the corners of the mouth, the lips, the nostrils, and the philtrum, the area between the upper lip and the nose. Cold sores are extremely contagious. Aphthous mouth ulcers typically affect the inside of the mouth, do not affect the nose, and are not contagious."

    "condition": "Appendix pain",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/appendix-pain/",
    "what_is_appendix_pain": "Appendix pain is typically described as pain or discomfort in the abdominal area (the belly), in the lower right side, where the appendix is located. Medically speaking, there is no such thing as “appendix pain”, even though the affected person may describe or experience it as such. The correct term is “abdominal pain”, which is a symptom of both serious and non-serious medical issues, such as gastroenteritis, gas, hepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome, gallstones, and indeed acute appendicitis. Abdominal pain or \"appendix pain\" in the region of the appendix may be caused by acute appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix that should be treated as a medical emergency.\n\nThe characteristic pain that results from acute appendicitis will typically begin in the vicinity of the stomach or belly button and then, as the abdominal wall and other organs begin to be affected by inflammation, the pain will move towards the lower right side of the abdomen and become more severe. However, pain from inflammation originating in the appendix may also be felt elsewhere in the abdominal area, though it is very common for it to be felt in the lower right region. Other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and fever may also occur. 1 Pain in the region of the abdomen is easily confused with pain from acute appendicitis, which specifically affects the appendix. A wide range of conditions can cause such abdominal pain, including non-serious buildups of gas or indigestion, as well as more serious conditions, such as ulcers , infection of the ovaries, diverticulitis , inflammatory bowel diseases, or kidney infection . People experiencing abdominal pain, whether or not localized to the lower right-hand side, that gradually gets worse, should seek medical attention urgently. 2 3",
    "what_is_the_appendix": "The appendix vermiformis (colloquially known as “the appendix”) is a small, narrow tube found at the end of the pouch-like cecum , which is found at the junction between the small and large intestine. In most people, the appendix is located in the lower right-hand side of the abdomen. Although the exact function of the appendix is unknown – and for a time it was widely believed to have no function – some doctors believe that the appendix may serve as a storage unit for good bacteria and play a role in the development of the immune system. 1",
    "causes": "As pain specific to acute appendicitis and abdominal pain from other causes are easily confused, it’s important to be aware of all of the common conditions that can cause this pain. Appendix pain is located in the abdomen. The abdomen can be divided into four quadrants, by imagining a vertical line running through the navel (belly button) and another running line through it horizontally. The human abdomen is a large region of the human body, and it is the location of a number of organs and organ systems. 4 The left upper quadrant contains the stomach, spleen, left kidney, small intestine, descending colon, and transverse colon. The left lower quadrant contains the small intestine and the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum. 4 The lower right quadrant contains the small intestine, the cecum, and the appendix , as well as the ascending colon. The upper right quadrant contains the pancreas, gallbladder, liver, right kidney, small intestine, ascending colon, and transverse colon. The bladder lies roughly on the midline of the lower quadrants. The abdominal cavity is lined by the peritoneum , which is made up of connective tissue. 4 The peritoneum can become infected, a condition known as peritonitis (see below). The organs are held in a web of tissue known as the mesentery . In men , the abdomen also contains the prostate , which is situated just below the bladder. In women , the abdomen also contains the uterus, cervix, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. These differences between men and women mean that, in some cases, pain may be felt differently. This is partly because different organs and structures are involved. In acute appendicitis, men and women experience pain in the same regions. Different disorders within the abdominal region may cause pain in different regions. For example, gastritis is usually felt in the left upper abdominal quadrant, while pain from an inflamed gallbladder or gallstones is felt in the right upper region. Pain which is experienced in the region of the appendix may be from acute appendicitis, but it may also result from other disorders and diseases of organs in the abdominal region .\n\nAcute appendicitis is a common condition that can affect people of all ages. It is an inflammation of the appendix , thought to be caused by a blockage of the appendix or by the appendix becoming infected. The main symptom of acute appendicitis is severe pain in the abdomen. This will usually begin as a dull pain located around the stomach area or belly button region, before gradually moving to the lower right side and becoming sharper and more severe. At this stage, the portion of the abdomen where the appendix is located may be painful or tender to touch. Other symptoms of acute appendicitis may include : 1 Nausea Vomiting Fever Constipation Frequent urination, because of irritation of and around the ureter, which can imitate the symptoms of a urinary tract infection. If the condition is left untreated, the appendix can burst. If this happens, an individual will typically experience severe pain across the entire abdominal region. This can cause peritonitis, a medically significant condition (see below). If any symptoms of the condition occur and acute appendicitis is suspected, immediate medical attention should be sought. A person will be admitted to a hospital and usually undergo surgery to remove the appendix. This common procedure is called an appendectomy and is considered routine by doctors. It will usually be carried out using laparoscopic surgery .\n\nAlthough acute appendicitis is a common cause of severe pain in the region of the appendix, there are a variety of other possible causes. The source of pain in this location is often difficult to pinpoint, meaning that pain, which feels like the result of acute appendicitis, may in fact stem from a different source, such as a problem related to other parts of the intestines or the kidneys. Other possible causes of abdominal pain include: 5 6 Food poisoning Diarrhea Constipation Vomiting Stomach ulcers Crohn’s disease Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) Inflammatory bowel disease Diverticulitis Infectious enterocolitis Peritonitis Gallstones Inflamed gallbladder Kidney infections Kidney stones Pancreatitis Hepatitis Urinary tract infections Women may additionally experience abdominal pain, usually in the lower abdomen, as a result of: Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, or inflamed ovaries Ectopic pregnancy Endometriosis Dysmenorrhea Miscarriage In rare cases, pain in the appendix area or abdomen can also be a symptom of a tumorous condition (benign or malignant). Nevertheless, if a tumorous condition is suspected, urgent medical attention may be required. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. 2",
    "appendix_pain_location": "What does appendix pain feel like? If acute appendicitis is the cause of the abdominal pain, the pain will generally begin as dull and be located around the stomach and/or belly button region. This pain can develop quickly or slowly, but will in most cases become severe over time. As the pain intensifies, the lower right-hand side of the abdomen, where the appendix is typically located, will generally become particularly tender and may be painful to the touch. If the appendix has burst, the pain will typically spread across the whole abdominal region and will be correspondingly severe.\n\nIn adults, appendix pain – or rather, pain in the region of the appendix – can be the result of appendicitis or another disorder. The location of the pain can sometimes indicate whether the pain is the result of appendicitis or another disorder.\n\nIn most cases, if the cause of the pain is acute appendicitis, the pain will begin around the belly button and then be felt in the right region of the stomach. If the pain is also felt on the left, the peritoneum may also be infected. This can cause something called rebound tenderness (see FAQs ).\n\nA number of other disorders of the abdomen typically cause pain only on the left or only on the right. Disorders which can cause pain on the right in men and women include: Cholecystitis/inflamed gallbladder Cholelithiasis/gallstones Hepatitis Duodenal ulcers Disorders which can typically cause pain on the left in men and women include: Pancreatitis Acute or chronic gastritis Diverticulitis Disorders that can typically cause pain on the left or the right or both in men and women include: 7 Inflammatory bowel disease Pyelonephritis , a kidney infection Nephrolithiasis , or kidney stones, which can cause pain in a number of locations throughout the abdomen UTIs, such as cystitis. Disorders that can typically cause pain in the middle of the abdomen in men and women include: Early appendicitis Stomach ulcers Gastroesophageal reflux disease Pancreatitis Urinary tract infections Inflammatory bowel disease\n\nThe location of appendix pain in men and women is the same. However, there are a number of conditions that may cause appendix pain, or abdominal pain, only in males. These include: 7 Testicular torsion Prostatitis\n\nAs stated above, men and women experience pain from acute appendicitis in the same locations. However, there are a number of conditions that may cause abdominal pain only in females. These include: 7 Ovarian torsion Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cysts or ruptured ovarian cysts Pregnancy Dysmenorrhea Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometriosis All of the above can cause pain in the region of the appendix, mostly in the right lower abdomen and the left lower abdomen. 8\n\nThe changes the body undergoes during pregnancy mean abdominal pain can be relatively normal, and it may be mistaken for pain from acute appendicitis. This pain can be a result of non-serious factors such as: The expanding uterus: As the uterus grows during pregnancy, the bowel is displaced, potentially leading to pain in the abdominal area. Round ligament pain: The round ligaments, located at the front of the uterus, can cause sharp and sometimes severe pain as the uterus expands. Typically, this pain is in the lower half of the abdomen. While the person experiencing the pain may confuse this with appendicitis, a physician will be able to tell the difference. Constipation and gas: Common during pregnancy, due to changes in the location of the gastrointestinal tract, which is pushed out of the way and compressed by the expanding uterus. Constipation and gas can cause mild to moderate pain in the whole abdominal region. At times, abdominal pain during pregnancy can be a result of more serious conditions. Urinary tract infection: A treatable condition with symptoms including a sudden and/or frequent urge to urinate, pain when urinating and general abdominal pain. Ectopic pregnancy: A condition that occurs when a fertilized egg implants itself somewhere other than the uterus, often causing severe abdominal pain. Pain from an ectopic pregnancy is usually felt in the lower abdomen. Miscarriage : Miscarriage is the sudden loss of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks. Symptoms can include pain and cramps on the right and left of the lower abdominal region. It is often accompanied by vaginal bleeding, as well as the loss of fluid or tissue from the vagina. Abdominal pain during pregnancy may also be the result of acute appendicitis. Appendicitis during pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose due to the movement of the appendix from its usual position to a higher position near the liver or belly button. In pregnant women, pain from acute appendicitis may be felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 7 These symptoms should be reported to doctors as soon as they occur. To prevent complications, emergency surgical intervention is typically required. 9\n\nPain in the region of the appendix in children may be a result of a variety of conditions. These include relatively non-serious conditions such as: 10 A buildup of gas Constipation Gastroenteritis Mild food poisoning A mild food allergy If abdominal pain lasts for longer than a day or is particularly severe, it could be a sign of a range of conditions including: Urinary tract infection Hernia Inflammatory bowel disease Intussusception of the bowel, where a section of the intestine slides into the next like a telescope folding up. This is rare and tends to affect the small intestine. However, it is a medical emergency. In some cases, appendicitis may be the cause of abdominal pain. Children with appendicitis often present with similar pain or symptoms as adults with the condition. Other symptoms of appendicitis in children include: Fever Vomiting Nausea Lack of appetite It is important to ensure children receive medical attention as soon as possible if appendicitis is suspected. Treatment will usually involve an appendectomy. This is considered a routine procedure but will involve a hospital stay.",
    "complications": "Acute appendicitis is a common disorder and is easily treated if it is diagnosed early. If it is not treated, the appendix may burst and this may lead to peritonitis.\n\nPeritonitis is uncommon, but when it does occur, it is a medical emergency. Peritonitis is an infection of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity. If it occurs without an underlying cause, it is known as primary peritonitis. However, peritonitis is usually caused by disorders including: 11 Acute appendicitis , if the appendix bursts Pancreatitis Diverticulitis Acute cholecystitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Penetrating injury of the abdomen, such as a stab wound or gunshot wound This list is not exhaustive. Many other abdominal disorders that involve inflammation can result in peritonitis if they are not treated. 7 Peritonitis is the result of an infection spreading from an organ to the peritoneal tissue. The regions in which pain is felt and how severe the pain is, change as the infection spreads. 11 Abdominal pain from peritonitis may be felt in several ways. Generally, an infection affecting an organ in the abdomen will be painful, and as the infection spreads to the peritoneum nearest the organ, the pain will also spread. If the infection then spreads to the entire peritoneum, the pain will then be felt as general belly pain and tenderness. Pain from peritonitis feels worse when the affected person flexes their hips or coughs; it is also painful if pressure is applied. 12 It will usually be most intense over the site of the organ that originally began the infection. Other symptoms of peritonitis may include: Fever, with a body temperature of 38 C/ 100.4 F Low blood pressure Fast heartbeat Low output of urine Septic shock in severe cases",
    "appendix_pain_relief": "Relief from abdominal pain will generally depend on its underlying cause. When caused by acute appendicitis, the standard treatment option is surgery, which will usually take the form of an appendectomy. If a person experiencing moderate or severe abdominal pain is concerned and shows no improvement within a reasonable amount of time, they should seek medical help. An appendectomy involves the complete removal of the appendix, sometimes following a course of antibiotics to reduce inflammation and make surgery easier. Keyhole surgery is generally used during this procedure, allowing for a shorter recovery time and less scarring. Generally, there are no long-term complications following an appendectomy. It is more likely that abdominal pain is the result of gastroenteritis, gas, or food poisoning than acute appendicitis. It may be best to treat for these first, before seeking emergency medical help. About 179 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are reported every year in the USA, but only 7% of the population will have appendicitis in their lifetime , making gastroenteritis more common than appendicitis. 13 14 Gastroenteritis generally includes diarrhea and vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain, and sometimes fever. Treatment of gastroenteritis and food poisoning includes bed rest, oral rehydration, and medication to manage nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, If there is no improvement in symptoms within a reasonable time with this treatment, then a physician should be consulted urgently.",
    "appendix_pain_faqs": "Q: In what location do you experience appendix pain? A: In most cases of appendicitis, the pain will typically begin around the stomach or belly button area and move to the lower right side of the abdomen, while also becoming sharper and more severe. Q: Why is appendix pain sometimes felt on the left? A: In most cases, pain from acute appendicitis is felt on the right. However, some people experience it on the left. This occurs when the inflammation affecting the appendix spreads to the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity. A common test that can distinguish possible appendicitis from other abdominal pain uses rebound tenderness to determine whether it is the appendix that is inflamed, or another structure. In this test, the doctor slowly presses their fingers on a part of the abdomen that does not hurt - in the case of suspected acute appendicitis, this would be the left-hand side - and then quickly lets go. The affected person feels pain in the lower right abdominal area. This sort of pain is known as “contralateral rebound tenderness”, as pain occurs on the side opposite to where the pressure is applied. In very few cases, the reason for appendix pain being felt on the left may be because of a hereditary condition known as situs inversus, in which the organs of the chest and abdomen are in mirror-image positions – that is, they are on the opposite side to where they are in most people. 15 In people with situs inversus, for example, the liver and appendix are on the left of the abdomen. However, situs inversus only affects about one in 8000 people, and it is far more likely that, if you feel appendix pain on the left, it is because of rebound tenderness. 16"

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/arthritis/",
    "what_is_arthritis": "Arthritis is a painful inflammation of one or more joints. By far the most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The key arthritis symptoms include pain, stiffness and swelling. Arthritis can be localized to one joint or it can affect many joints, and can affect different structures inside a joint, such as the joint lining known as the synovium, bones, cartilage, or supporting tissues. The symptoms can also vary in severity and frequency. Some forms of arthritis are short-term conditions, while others are long-term and may permanently damage joint function. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app . Arthritis is a very common condition. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about one in four adults have some kind of arthritis. Most forms of arthritis predominantly affect older people, though it can affect people at any age. There are some conditions, generally rare, that cause arthritis in children and teenagers. Arthritis has many possible causes, such as age-related wear and tear, autoimmune conditions, infections and injuries. A range of treatment options are available for arthritis, with the chosen option dependent on the type of arthritis and its causes. Some types of arthritis respond well to treatment, while other types are harder to control.",
    "different_types": "There are many different types of arthritis and related chronic conditions of the joints – some sources estimate over 200 – with differing causes and symptoms. 1 Most, though not all, types of arthritis can be sorted by cause into two categories: Inflammatory arthritis: All arthritis is characterized by inflammation, which is part of the body’s healing process. However, in the case of inflammatory arthritis, inflammation generally occurs for no obvious reason. This is known as an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system is overactive. The most common form of inflammatory arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis. People affected by inflammatory arthritis generally feel stiffness in the joints following rest, such as just after getting out of bed in the morning. Degenerative or mechanical arthritis covers types of arthritis in which there is damage to the joints through wear and tear. The most common form of degenerative arthritis is osteoarthritis. Symptoms of degenerative arthritis tend to get worse with movement or weight bearing i.e. when the person stands up, but improve after rest. Degenerative arthritis tends to be more common in older people. Types of degenerative arthritis tend to affect joints asymmetrically, meaning they don't appear in the same joints on both sides of the body. The most common types of arthritis include:\n\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, with more than 30 million adults in the U.S affected by the condition. It is a degenerative arthritis, most often causing arthritis of the hand, the knee, and the hips. The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are deep, achy joint pain that worsens with activity, decreased range of movement and stiffness during rest, known as gelling. It generally affects several joints. It is most common in women leading up to and after menopause. 2 Athletes are also at increased risk of osteoarthritis, due to repeated use of particular joints. The condition is caused by damage to or breakdown of joint cartilage, a connective tissue that covers the ends of long bones at the joints, as well as other areas of the joint. 3 In normal joints, cartilage acts as a shock absorber and allows bones to slide over one another. Osteoarthritis damage may occur as a result of joint injury or overuse. Treatment includes regular exercise, hot or cold compresses, working towards a healthy weight if overweight, physical and occupational therapy, and pain medication. In severe cases, surgery may repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint. Surgical intervention is common with osteoarthritis that affects the knee and hip.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the second most common type of arthritis and the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms occur in flare-ups, when symptoms of pain and swelling are worse, and periods of improved or no symptoms. It usually causes arthritis in the hands, feet and wrists. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment aims to slow down the overactive immune system. Read more about Rheumatoid Arthritis »\n\nGout, also known as gouty arthritis, is an inflammatory arthritis causing attacks of pain and inflammation in the joints. It tends to start with severe pain in one joint, often that of the big toe, where it is known as podagra. Gout is generally caused by too much uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a chemical that is increased in the body by ingesting certain foods, including: Oily fish Red meat Organ meats such as liver or kidneys Alcohol. Other reasons uric acid might develop include: High blood pressure Obesity Taking certain medications Older age Being male Having gone through menopause Insulin resistance, such as in type 2 diabetes . Read more about Podagra » Read more about Gout »\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is a long-term inflammatory arthritis that is associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, known as plaques. About one or two in every five people with psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. 4 Some people with psoriatic arthritis, however, will never develop the skin condition. Psoriatic arthritis is an autoimmune condition thought to be triggered by a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors, such as certain infections and joint injury. 5 The condition is progressive, damaging the joints over time. However, with medication, it is possible to slow down the progression of the arthritis and minimize joint damage. Psoriatic arthritis varies widely in severity, tending to occur in flare-ups and periods of improved or no symptoms. There are various typical patterns of joints affected by psoriatic arthritis, most often the distal joints, the end joints of the fingers and toes. Most commonly, psoriatic arthritis is asymmetric, not affecting the same joints on both sides of the body, and causes symptoms in several joints at once. Some people also have psoriatic arthritis symptoms in their fingernails or eyes. Psoriatic arthritis is treated with medications which suppress the immune system, called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS). Over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen, can reduce pain and swelling. Ideally, one medication should be taken to treat both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis when both conditions are present together. People with other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, may also have psoriasis without the two conditions being linked. Read more about plaque psoriasis here >>\n\nSeptic arthritis is an infection in a joint causing inflammation. This condition can affect anyone, but most commonly occurs in association with prosthetic joints, such as knee and hip replacements, and other joint surgeries. Septic arthritis causes severe pain, swelling, redness and heat in affected joints. The symptoms usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days. Without prompt treatment, septic arthritis may lead to permanent joint damage and can be life-threatening. Read more about Septic Arthritis »\n\nReactive arthritis (ReA), formerly known as Reiter’s syndrome is a short-term, inflammatory arthritis that develops as a reaction to certain bacterial infections. Typically, ReA is triggered by chlamydia, but can also be brought on by other infections, such as food poisoning. Read more about Reactive Arthritis » .\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a lifelong inflammatory arthritis of the back. The word ankylosing means joining together or fusing, and spondylitis means inflammation of the spine. The condition causes the affected spine joints to fuse together into one bone. Inflammation causes the bone-making cells to grow bone within the ligaments, which then may form bony bridges between the vertebrae of the spine. The condition mainly affects the lower back, but can spread up the spine, causing arthritis of the neck and other joints. The cause of the condition is unknown, but there is normally a genetic component. Smoking is known to make the disease more severe. Symptoms usually include back pain and stiffness, inflammation in other joints, and extreme tiredness. Onset normally occurs gradually in early adulthood, between the ages of 20 and 30. 6 Severity of symptoms varies widely. It is associated with a serious but treatable eye condition called uveitis. Treatment involves physiotherapy and exercise, painkillers such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and medication to suppress the immune system.\n\nArthritis is treated within the medical field of rheumatology. Rheumatology is the study of conditions marked by inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles or fibrous tissue. Some rheumatic conditions may commonly cause the symptoms of arthritis, even if the condition does not predominantly affect the joints. These include: 7 8 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known as lupus, is a long-term autoimmune condition that may cause inflammation in almost every part of the body, commonly including joint pains, as well as skin rashes and tiredness. Paget’s disease of bone is a condition in which the normal cycle of bone renewal is disrupted, which can weaken the bones and in some cases cause them to become deformed. Osteoarthritis is a common complication of Paget’s disease. Viral arthritis is inflammation of a joint caused by a viral infection. Some viruses have a tendency to affect the joints, such as dengue fever and mumps. This type of arthritis is normally self-limiting and requires no specific intervention.\n\nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, is a chronic inflammatory arthritis, that occurs in children under 16 years old . It is not known exactly what causes the autoimmune condition, but it is associated with inherited factors and may be triggered by infection. 9 Many children will grow out of JIA, though it is not possible to accurately predict this.

    "diagnosis": "In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to fully describe the nature of joint pain to the doctor, making sure to include information such as: How long the joint inflammation and pain has been noticeable The location and severity of the pain If any family members have experienced arthritis or autoimmune conditions Whether there are other symptoms Following the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a physical exam to check for swollen joints or loss of motion, and use blood tests and X-rays to confirm a diagnosis and distinguish the type of arthritis. 10",
    "treating_arthritis": "It is always important to seek prompt diagnosis and treatment of arthritis, as well as any other associated conditions. Early intervention helps to prevent joint damage, which can lead to physical disability. Arthritis treatment will vary, depending on the type of arthritis, but generally may include: Rest Exercise Medication Occupational or physical therapy In some cases, surgery.",
    "arthritis_faqs": "Q: How many types of arthritis exist? A: Some sources estimate that there are over 200 different types of arthritis and related conditions. Arthritis can range from mild to severe. Causes are normally either degenerative wear-and-tear of cartilage, such as with osteoarthritis, or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Together all of these forms of arthritis make up the most chronic illness in the U.S. It is important to find out which type of arthritis is present, as each condition will have a different underlying cause, progression and treatment. Q: Are there home remedies for arthritis? A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for arthritis, which may help to relieve symptoms, but will not have a significant impact on the progress of the disease. Some of the most regularly cited include: Using heat pads or ice packs Swimming Omega-3, which is found in fish, canola oil and supplements However, if arthritis is suspected, professional medical attention should always be sought. Q: What are some risk factors for arthritis? A: Although it depends on the type of arthritis, some factors increase the risks of several different types. Arthritis risk factors include: 11 12 Smoking tobacco Being overweight Certain inherited traits, such as HLA-B27, a gene associated with autoimmune conditions Increasing age Joint injury or certain repetitive movements Q: Can Tylenol be taken as pain relief for arthritis? A: Tylenol, which has acetaminophen as its active ingredient, may be suitable to treat pain caused by some types of arthritis, but not for others. Acetaminophen works best for pain that is not specifically from arthritis, such as pain from osteoarthritis. It is important to consult a doctor before taking Tylenol for arthritis, to devise the best treatment plan. Q: What is the ESR test? A: In cases where inflammatory arthritis is suspected, a blood test known as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test may be done to show whether there is inflammation and to what degree. However, these markers are not always present alongside inflammation. Q: Can arthritis be cured or go away on its own? A: There is no cure for most types of arthritis. Exceptions include septic arthritis, which may be cured with antibiotics. Some types of arthritis can go away on their own, such as reactive arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Symptoms of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can get better or go away altogether during periods known as remission. There are also many treatments that can help slow down the condition. Q: Is arthritis hereditary? A: Certain risk factors may increase the chance of developing arthritis. Genetic factors and family history are among the risk factors for many types of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. There are specific genes associated with certain types of arthritis, such as HLA-B27 and HLA-DR4. Some types of arthritis are considered to be caused by a result of interactions between genetic factors and environmental factors."

    "condition": "Asthma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/asthma/",
    "what_is_asthma": "Asthma is an inflammatory condition which affects the airways in the lungs. It is one of the most common non-contagious diseases, affecting around 235 million people globally, according to the World Health Organization. 1 The condition can affect men, women and children of all ages. It usually first develops in childhood, but can also appear for the first time in adults. Asthma primarily affects the bronchial tubes in the lungs, called the airways. During an asthma attack, in which symptoms of asthma flare up, people typically experience breathing difficulties, due to the inflammation of the airways, which results in reduced airflow into the lungs. Asthma can vary in severity; its symptoms may be present every day or only during an asthma attack. The most common symptoms of asthma include wheezing, chest pain and shortness of breath. 1 2\n\nThe reasons why some people develop asthma and others do not are not yet fully medically understood, but there is believed to be a strong genetic component. When asthma develops, it is believed to be due to inhaling irritants in the air, causing an allergic reaction in the airways. Air pollution, pollen and allergens in the air are some of the most common irritants which cause a person to develop asthma and/or can act as triggers for asthma attacks. A person may find that the triggers of their asthma attacks change over time. Triggers of asthma in childhood may cease to cause symptoms in adulthood, for example. 3 With effective treatment, asthma occurring at any age can be managed effectively so as to reduce its impact on a person’s quality of life. Treatment of asthma involves learning about and minimizing contact with one’s triggers and the use of medications as needed to relieve ongoing symptoms and to treat asthma attacks. These medications are often inhaled directly into the lungs in the form of a vapour with the use of nebulizers or inhalers,two devices which are easy to use and designed for this purpose.",
    "asthma_and_covid_19": "In certain cases, asthma may put you at risk of severe complications due to COVID-19 . Asthma has been associated with long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19 and a deterioration of the condition due to the infection with the coronavirus. Read more about the link between COVID-19 and asthma here .",
    "symptoms": "Typical symptoms of asthma include: 1 2 Wheezing Coughing Chest tightness Shortness of breath Usually, these symptoms will be: 2 Recurrent At their most severe first thing in the morning and/or at night Present, or worse, in relation to particular activities, i.e. after contact with a trigger, such as tobacco smoke or exercising If you think that you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of asthma, get a free assessment with the Ada app . Asthma can affect a person to varying degrees of severity , which is medically assessed according to factors such as: 4 The frequency with which symptoms appear Their impact on a person’s ability to carry out their daily routine and live a good quality of life The impact of the asthma on their lung function, measured with lung function tests The speed at which they can exhale air, a measurement called peak flow To keep track of their symptoms, people affected by asthma usually carry out peak flow tests, also called peak expiratory flow or PEF tests, twice daily, using a peak flow meter. This is a portable handheld device which allows a person to notice changes in their respiratory function, anticipate flare ups and thereby preventively use medication if needed. For more information about tests which measure a person’s lung function and peak flow, see the ‘Diagnosis’ section. In adults and children over 12 years of age, asthma severity is classified according to the following criteria: 5\n\nAlso called mild intermittent asthma, this is the least severe form of the condition. People with intermittent asthma experience: 5 6 Symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing around twice per week or less, with nighttime awakenings due to symptoms occurring twice a month or less Normal lung function between flare ups, with a retention of 80 percent or more of their normal lung function when asthma is active A peak flow score which never varies to a level of more than 20 percent less than their normal score, when asthma is inactive Intermittent asthma generally causes no symptoms or interference with a person’s day-to-day activities between flare ups, and those affected should be able to attend work or school, and exercise as normal. 5 People with intermittent asthma tend to have only a few triggers. These are likely to be triggers which are not encountered every day or throughout the year, i.e. seasonal triggers, such as pollen. Bouts of wheezing and coughing, which are otherwise absent, may also develop when the function of a person’s respiratory system is otherwise compromised, i.e. due to a chest infection. 6\n\nPeople with mild persistent asthma experience: 5 Symptoms such as coughing and wheezing more than two days per week, but not every day, and may wake up in the night due to coughing and shortness of breath three or four times per month Normal lung function between flare ups, with scores of 80 percent or more of normal lung function test values when asthma is active A peak flow score which varies between 20 and 30 percent less than their normal score, depending on asthma’s activity When symptoms occur, or around a flare up, mild persistent asthma may cause minor limitations on a person’s ability to carry out their routine as normal, for example, they may tire more easily during the working day or lack their usual stamina while playing sports. Symptoms may increase with activity. 7\n\nPeople with moderate persistent asthma experience: 5 Symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and breathlessness daily, with nighttime awakenings due to symptoms more than once per week, but not every night Lung function test results of between 60 and 80 percent of normal lung function test values A peak flow score of more than 30 percent variability People with moderate persistent asthma are likely to find that flare ups are exercise induced and affect their activity levels, decreasing their capacity for physical exercise and sometimes necessitating time off work or school. 8\n\nPeople with severe persistent asthma experience: 5 Symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing and breathlessness daily, with nighttime awakenings due to symptoms nearly every night Lung function test results of less than or equal to 60 percent of normal values A peak flow score of more than 30 percent variability Being affected by severe persistent asthma can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life, as it can be difficult to control, with the airways often being or becoming too inflamed for typical treatment approaches to work well. Devising an effective treatment or management plan with one’s doctor can therefore be an ongoing process, particularly if there are many different triggers that need to be identified. Until an effective treatment plan is devised, asthma symptoms will significantly reduce the activity levels and quality of life of the affected person. Asthma, which was previously mild or moderate, may become severe over time. It is not known why some people develop severe persistent asthma and others do not, but this form of the condition is more likely to affect those with a previous diagnosis of asthma than the general population. 9 The 2016 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines make a point of differentiating between severe and poorly controlled asthma: persistent asthmatic symptoms may be caused by an ineffective treatment approach, rather being an indicator, or the result of having, a particularly severe case of asthma. 10\n\nDuring an asthma attack, symptoms of asthma worsen for a short time. In the body, an asthma attack is caused by swelling of the bronchial tubes, causing a sudden narrowing of the airways, which prevents air from entering the lungs. Early warning signs of an asthma attack include: 11 Worsening of asthma symptoms, particularly coughing and shortness of breath Needing to use medication that provides quick relief from symptoms more often than normal Finding that the duration for which quick relief medications provide relief from symptoms is shorter than normal, i.e. less than four hours 12 Becoming tired more quickly after activities, especially exercise During an asthma attack, a person may experience some or all of the following symptoms: 2 11 Regular symptoms of asthma ‒ wheezing, coughing and breathlessness ‒ may become more intense, and/or constant Tightening of the neck and chest muscles; retractions A rattling sound in the chest Increased heart rate Feeling faint or fainting Breathlessness, which can lead to difficulties eating, speaking or sleeping Feelings of anxiety or panic Pale face Blue fingers or lips Sweating Drowsiness Exhaustion Confusion Dizziness The duration of an asthma attack may vary, depending on how inflamed a person’s airways are, and how long they have been inflamed for. Asthma attacks can last a few minutes, or in more severe cases, hours or days. A mild asthma attack may get better on its own or with medication, while a more severe asthma attack may require medical attention to bring symptoms under control. All people with asthma will have clear written instructions, called an asthma action plan, which provides advice on how to manage asthma generally, as well as during an asthma attack. When an asthma attack occurs, a person should follow their action plan and seek emergency medical attention if symptoms do not clear up as expected. For advice on treating an asthma attack, see the ‘Treatment’ section of this resource.\n\nAsthma affects around 6.2 million children in the U.S. 13 If a child experiences recurrent coughing, wheezing, tightness or pain in their chest, or shortness of breath, it is important to consult a doctor, as one or more of these symptoms may indicate childhood-onset asthma. As with adults, the most common signs of asthma in children include: 2 Wheezing Chest pain Shortness of breath These symptoms may be present every day or only during an asthma attack. Asthma can cause acute discomfort and can have a debilitating effect on the child’s overall health, including symptoms like tiredness, depleted strength and recurrent coughing. Possible warning signs and symptoms of childhood-onset asthma include: Wheezing Chest pain Chest tightness Depleted stamina after play or exercise Diminished energy throughout the day Difficulty drawing breath Recurrent coughing, typically at night Retractions, i.e. involuntary pulling-in of the chest which occurs as a result of labored breathing Shortness of breath Children are affected by asthma more commonly than adults. Asthma in children usually starts to develop in early childhood, often before the age of five. Despite the presence of asthma-like symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose asthma in infants and young children, as their lungs may not be developed sufficiently to carry out certain tests. Are you worried that your child, or a child that you know, may be experiencing symptoms of asthma? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app . The potential impact of childhood-onset asthma on a child’s quality of life and long-term health can be significantly minimized by identifying appropriate treatment methods to bring their symptoms under control. Children with untreated asthma tire more easily after exercise than their peers and are prone to coughing and wheezing. With effective treatment, it is possible to reduce the symptoms of asthma, so that asthmatic children can carry out their day-to-day activities as normal , including participating in exercise and outdoor activities. For more information, see this resource on asthma in children .\n\nSymptoms of asthma in toddlers and babies may include: 14 Wheezing Fast or labored breathing Difficulties eating and drinking as normal, including breast or bottle feeding Breathlessness, particularly when this is exercise-induced, i.e. during play Fatigue, which may manifest as a lack of interest in normal activities Pallor; pale colouring in the face, and/or blue lips and fingers At least half of children who are diagnosed with asthma show the first signs of developing the condition before the age of five . 14 The most common sign is developing a respiratory infection in the lungs, at which point medical attention should be sought in order to establish the cause of the problem. Children under five are more prone to respiratory infections than the general population, there are therefore many other common conditions which their possibly asthmatic symptoms could relate to, including bronchitis, croup or epiglottis, rendering a medical assessment essential.",
    "causes": "The symptoms of asthma are caused by the swelling of the airways, which makes them temporarily narrow, reducing airflow to and from the lungs. It is not always possible to identify the reasons why a person has developed asthma, and it is possible to develop the condition with no apparent trigger. The main causes of asthma are believed to include: 15 Genetic predisposition. People with asthma, eczema, hives and/or allergic rhinitis, or a family medical history of these conditions, are more likely to develop asthma than those without. Environmental factors. Inhaling certain particles in the atmosphere can cause a person to develop asthma. These include dust mites, pollen and pet dander, as well as air pollutants such as smoke from tobacco products. Infections which affect the airways. Viral infections, such as the viruses which cause the common cold , can cause asthma to develop in some people. Research suggests that growing up in an urbanised area makes people more likely to develop asthma , based on studies comparing the prevalence of the condition in rural environments, compared to more built-up areas. The reasons for this are not yet fully understood, but are thought to relate to higher levels of pollution in urbanized areas, in combination with the fact that rural environments are believed to provide children with certain protective effects against developing asthma. 16 This is known as the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nAlso known as biome depletion theory, or lost friends theory, the hygiene hypothesis is the proposition that increased exposure to particular infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and parasites has beneficial effects on the development of the immune system. 17 Exposure to a wider variety of germs at a young age as a result of being raised in a rural area or a large family, compared to being an only child, or being a child raised in a cleaner, urban environment, is believed to help teach the developing immune system to differentiate effectively between harmful and harmless substances. Therefore, according to the hygiene hypothesis, substances such as pet dander, which may trigger the development of asthma, may be less likely to cause inflammation of the airways and the development of asthma in a child who grew up in a rural area or a larger family, with exposure to more germs, than in an only child or one who grew up in a more hygienic urban area. The hygiene hypothesis is not universally medically accepted. An important reason for this is that exposure to certain viruses, for example respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is believed to increase the likelihood of a child developing asthma. 18 Furthermore, it is impossible to predict accurately whether a child will develop asthma or not. Efforts to expose a child to germs ‒ such as one might encounter on a farm ‒  in order to help develop their immune system are therefore not recommended. Not only is this likely to trigger asthma in children predisposed to the condition, but it also increases the possibility of developing other harmful diseases and infections.\n\nIn people who are predisposed to develop asthma, the swelling of the airways occurs in relation to exposure to certain triggers. The triggers which cause asthma symptoms to appear or worsen vary greatly between people. Over time, a person may grow out of developing an asthmatic response to certain triggers or find that they have developed new triggers. Triggers of asthma may cause asthma to develop in the first place, as well as causing asthma symptoms to flare up in people already affected by the condition. Asthma attacks or symptoms can be triggered by a very wide variety of different factors including: 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Respiratory infections; such as colds and flu, which inflame the airways Exercise; the changes to the way a person breathes when they exercise can serve to trigger asthma symptoms Allergens; asthma can be triggered by allergies to seasonal irritants like pollen, perennial irritants like dust mites, pet dander and, if the affected person has a food allergy, certain foods Molds and fungi, due to the spores they release into the air, which can be inhaled Outdoor irritants, such as pollution, fumes and smoke Indoor irritants, such as cleaning and decorating products, solvents, dust, carpeting and dust-containing air from ventilation systems Alcohol; either all alcoholic drinks or certain types; in some cases asthma symptoms may be triggered by commonly added chemicals like histamine and sulfites rather than the alcohol itself Smoke from tobacco products; smoking can make asthma worse over time by causing permanent lung damage. Even second-hand smoke can trigger asthma symptoms Medications, especially beta-blockers, pain relievers like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and medications used to treat hypotension and heart disease, called Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Emotions, in particular, stress, laughter and distress Hormonal changes in women; the fluctuations in hormonal levels that occur during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause are all possible triggers of asthma Weather, in particular, changes from hot to cold, and thunderstorms, due to the increased moisture in the air Good to know: There are several types of asthma which are associated with certain kinds of triggers, for example: Allergic asthma is a type of asthma which is triggered by allergens, in people affected by allergies Exercise-induced asthma is asthma, which only occurs when the affected person exercises Occupational asthma is a type of asthma caused by irritant particles encountered in the workplace, for example from cleaning products, fumes, smoke, cereal dust or flour Occupations which carry a high risk of being exposed to irritant particles which can trigger asthma include: Firefighters Chemical workers Those involved in food preparation or processing Hospital staff Painters and builders Animal handlers Agricultural workers",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_asthma": "There are certain factors which increase a person’s risk of developing asthma. These include: 26 27 28 Being affected by an atopic condition, such as eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis or hay fever Having family members or a family medical history of atopic conditions Exposure to smoke from tobacco products; this includes using them oneself, second-hand smoke and being exposed to tobacco smoke as a young child and/or before birth due to their mother smoking in pregnancy Exposure to irritant particles as a result of one’s job Living in a highly polluted area Getting respiratory infections, such as bronchitis, as a child; due to conflicting scientific findings, it is currently unclear whether these kinds of infections are causative of, or protective against, asthma Being obese, which increases the likelihood of inflammation developing within the body, including in the airways The risk of asthma associated with a person’s biological sex depends on their age. In childhood, boys are more likely to develop asthma than girls, whereas in adulthood, women are more likely to develop asthma than men. This is thought to be explained, in part, by the hormonal fluctuations which women experience due to their menstrual cycle. 27"

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/ataxia/",
    "overview": "Ataxia is a neurological sign rather than a distinct condition or a group of conditions. It results from dysfunction in brain regions responsible for coordinating movement; most commonly the cerebellum, but also the spinal cord, nerves, and nerve roots. Ataxia leads to uncoordinated movements, which can affect balance, speech, and motor control. Causes of ataxia vary and may include genetic disorders, brain or spinal cord injuries, infections, toxins, metabolic diseases, and neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or stroke. Treatment depends on the cause; some types of ataxia are treatable or even curable, while others require symptom management to improve quality of life. 1\n\nAtaxia is not a condition but a neurological sign resulting from dysfunction in the brain regions responsible for coordinating movement; most commonly the cerebellum, but also the spinal cord, nerves, and nerve roots. This dysfunction can lead to symptoms such as loss of muscle coordination, balance issues, and difficulty walking, eating, and speaking. There are various types of ataxia, each with its own underlying cause and treatment options. In this guide by Ada’s medical team, you’ll find more information about ataxia symptoms, causes, and treatments.",
    "what_is_ataxia": "Ataxia is a neurological sign , not a condition, that results from dysfunction in the brain regions responsible for coordinating movement. While the most common cause is damage or dysfunction of the cerebellum, other parts of the nervous system such as the spinal cord, nerves, and nerve roots can also be involved. Ataxia affects coordination, balance, and speech, leading to a range of symptoms that vary in severity depending on the underlying cause. 2",
    "what_are_the_3_types": "Ataxia can be divided into three categories, depending on the cause of the condition. 2 3 Acquired ataxia , which is an issue with your coordination, balance and/or speech due to a trauma to the head or conditions that affect the brain such as stroke, multiple sclerosis , or a brain tumor. In some cases, ataxia can also develop due to a vitamin E deficiency or due to the presence of toxins. Hereditary ataxia , which is ataxia that develops as a result of a faulty gene. These genes are inherited by your parents. The most common form of hereditary ataxia is Friedreich’s ataxia . Other examples are ataxia-telangiectasia, spinocerebellar ataxia and episodic ataxia. Idiopathic ataxia , which is ataxia with an unknown cause. This type of ataxia often tends to get worse over time 4",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Ataxia symptoms are primarily related to uncoordinated movement of different muscles in the body. This may include: 2 5 6 Loss of coordination Lack of muscle coordination during voluntary movement Frequent falls Difficulty walking Poor balance Trouble eating and swallowing Problems with eye movement and vision Uncontrollable movements of the hands, arms, or jaws, also known as tremor Difficulty writing or doing other tasks that require fine movements Reduced reflexes Ataxia symptoms can get worse over time, especially without treatment. The exact symptoms you are experiencing may depend on the type of ataxia you’re suffering from.",
    "when_to_see_a_doctor": "Ataxia can lead to a decrease in quality of life and may even decrease your life expectancy. It is important to visit your doctor if you notice any of the signs of ataxia . If your parents or grandparents suffer from ataxia, then it is also a good idea to visit your doctor. Through genetic testing , you can know whether or not you have inherited the faulty gene responsible for the development of the condition.",
    "what_causes_ataxia": "Ataxia can have acquired or hereditary causes and is usually associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum, but other parts of the nervous system such as the spinal cord, nerves, and nerve roots can also be involved. Acquired causes include conditions affecting the brain, such as multiple sclerosis or stroke, head trauma, vitamin E deficiency, and excessive alcohol consumption. In some cases, hereditary genetic disorders can also lead to ataxia. 2 6",

Some forms of ataxia which are due to a vitamin deficiency can however be treated and have a better outlook. 2",
    "what_tests_confirm_ataxia": "In order to diagnose ataxia, a healthcare provider will first ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms, followed by a physical examination . If your healthcare provider suspects that you may suffer from ataxia, then there are certain tests to be done in order to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions which may cause your symptoms. Some possible tests are: 6 Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies or toxins Urine tests to look for certain toxins MRI or CT scan to look at the cerebellum A lumbar puncture to test the cerebrospinal fluid An EMG to see how well electrical signals are passed through your nerves Genetic testing to look for faulty genes that cause ataxia",

Various treatment options are available to help improve symptoms and enhance quality of life.",
    "ataxia_faqs": "Q: What are the early signs of ataxia? A: Early signs of ataxia often include a subtle loss of coordination , which may first be noticed as frequent tripping, clumsiness, or difficulty with fine motor tasks. Other symptoms can include balance issues, difficulty walking, slurred speech, and trouble swallowing or eating. The severity and progression of symptoms depend on the underlying cause. Q: Who usually gets ataxia? A: Ataxia can happen to anyone, although people who have a relative with ataxia, or people with underlying conditions such as multiple sclerosis or stroke are at a higher risk of developing this neurological sign. Q: Does ataxia show up on MRI? A: An MRI is one of the possible diagnostic tests that your healthcare provider may recommend. This is because an MRI makes it possible to study the cerebellum in order to find the possible ataxia cause. Q: Can cerebellar ataxia be reversed? A: Whether or not cerebellar ataxia can be reversed depends on the type of cerebellar ataxia. Many cases are not curable, although there are some forms of cerebellar ataxia, such as acute cerebellar ataxia caused by a virus, which can be reversed. Q: What is the difference between apraxia vs ataxia? A: Ataxia affects the parts of the nervous system that coordinate movement for muscle coordination and balance, whereas apraxia affects the part of the brain tthat processes the information and plans movements. This may cause similar symptoms at times since both conditions can make it difficult to do certain tasks. Q: What is the life expectancy of a person with ataxia? A: The life expectancy for people suffering from ataxia depends on the cause and the severity of the condition."

    "what_is_atherosclerosis": "Atherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty deposits, known as plaque, atheroma or atheromatous plaque, build up within the walls of the arteries. Over time, these deposits of plaque may become larger, narrowing the arteries and restricting blood flow to certain organs. Atherosclerosis is related to a number of cardiovascular conditions, including coronary heart disease and stroke . There are a variety of risk factors associated with the condition, with some of the most common including high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and obesity. Although atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition, it can be managed through lifestyle changes and treatment of its underlying causes. 1 Atherosclerosis is a specific variety of arteriosclerosis, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Arteriosclerosis refers to a hardening and loss of elasticity in the arteries, which can lead to the same complications as those associated with atherosclerosis. 2",
    "causes": "Atherosclerosis is caused by a buildup of plaque in the artery walls. Plaque is composed of calcium, cholesterol, fats and other substances found in the blood. If it hardens, plaque can block the arteries and restrict blood flow. 3 A number of pre-existing conditions, lifestyle choices and other factors can make atherosclerosis more likely. The most common of these include: 4 High cholesterol levels High blood pressure Diabetes Smoking Obesity Lack of physical activity Unhealthy diet (high in salt, sugar, fats and cholesterol) Aging Family history of cardiovascular disease Stress Alcohol consumption",
    "conditions_associated_with_atherosclerosis": "Atherosclerosis may partially, or totally, block the arteries in the heart, brain, legs, arms, pelvis or kidneys. If this occurs, various conditions can result. These include:\n\nA buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-enriched blood to the heart, can lead to a significant narrowing of these arteries. If this happens, the blood flow to the heart is restricted – a condition which is called coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease. It is the most common condition associated with atherosclerosis. Coronary heart disease can cause angina – feelings of pain, squeezing or tightening in the chest. Furthermore, if one of the plaques ruptures, or a clot of blood or fat gets stuck in the narrowed blood vessel, a heart attack may occur; this is a leading cause of mortality in the USA. 5 6 7\n\nAtherosclerosis can lead to a range of cerebrovascular conditions, including stroke and transient ischemic attack , sometimes called a mini-stroke. These conditions occur when plaque builds up in the arteries leading to the brain, restricting blood flow and starving the brain of oxygen. 4\n\nPeripheral arterial disease generally refers to a narrowing of the arteries in any location other than the heart or brain, with the legs being the most commonly affected area. Atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of this condition. When affecting the legs, peripheral arterial disease is characterized by pain in the calves, especially when walking or exercising. 8\n\nVascular dementia is a condition that results in memory loss, thinking problems and issues with language as a result of a reduced supply of blood to the brain. Along with Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia is one of the most common types of dementia.\n\nChronic kidney disease develops when the kidneys become unable to perform properly their function of filtering excess water and other waste products from the blood. A buildup of plaque in the arteries of the kidneys can cause chronic kidney disease, which can eventually lead to kidney failure. 9\n\nAtherosclerosis is among the leading causes of erectile dysfunction, the condition of being unable to get or maintain an erection. An erection is caused by a rush of blood to the penis. When the blood vessels in the penis begin to narrow, blood flow is restricted, causing erectile dysfunction. 10 Read more about Erectile Dysfunction » If you are concerned that you may have one of these conditions, you can try using the Ada app for a free assessment.",
    "diagnosing_atherosclerosis": "Diagnosing atherosclerosis will generally involve a doctor looking at the person's medical history, a physical examination and a range of tests. During the physical examination, a stethoscope will normally be used to listen to the person’s heartbeat and blood flow in the vessels. The medical professional will take special care to listen for sounds that indicate the narrowing of the blood vessels, which can often indicate the presence of plaque and clogged arteries. Tests that may aid a diagnosis of atherosclerosis include: 11 Blood pressure measurement: A doctor will check whether the readings are out of range. Blood tests: To check the levels of fats, sugars, cholesterol and protein in the blood. Read more about blood tests . Electrocardiogram (ECG): A method for testing the electrical activity of the heart. Chest X-ray: An image of the organs and blood vessels within the chest is taken, allowing doctors to check for abnormalities. Echocardiography: An ultrasound is used to create an image of the heart. This can give doctors a holistic picture of the heart’s health. Computed tomography (CT) scan: A computer-generated image of the body is created, allowing doctors to see signs of artery narrowing or hardening. Angiography: A contrast dye is injected into specific blood vessels, which can then be visualized by X-ray. Catheters are often used. This test allows doctors to see signs of atherosclerosis.",
    "treating_atherosclerosis": "At present, no treatment exists to reverse atherosclerosis. However, there are a variety of ways to slow the progress of the condition and reduce the risk of complications, such as heart attack and stroke. 12 These include: ref1 Lifestyle changes that are also used to help prevent atherosclerosis (see below) Statins and other medications used to treat high cholesterol Medications used to treat high blood pressure Low-dose aspirin and other medications used to treat blood clots Medications for diabetes Surgical procedures to bypass or widen an artery, such as a coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplasty A doctor will be able to advise on the treatment options available in each case. Doctors can also recommend lifestyle changes that may help manage the condition.",
    "preventing_atherosclerosis": "As there is no direct treatment for atherosclerosis, healthcare professionals place emphasis on methods of preventing the condition from developing. These preventive methods include: Stopping smoking Getting regular exercise Eating a healthy, balanced diet Maintaining a healthy weight Avoiding alcohol A doctor will be able to advise on the best methods of pursuing these lifestyle changes.",
    "atherosclerosis_faqs": "Q: Is atherosclerosis of the aorta possible? A: Yes, plaque deposits can form in the aorta, causing atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis can cause an aortic aneurysm and increase the risk of stroke. 13 Q: What is atherosclerotic calcification? A: The plaque that builds up as a result of atherosclerosis generally contains traces of calcium. Atherosclerotic calcification refers to the process of calcium buildup, which is of particular interest to doctors and scientists due to its similarity to the process of bone formation. 14 Q: What is the difference between atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis? A: Atherosclerosis is a specific variety of arteriosclerosis, though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Arteriosclerosis refers to a hardening and loss of elasticity in the arteries, which can be caused by atherosclerosis or other conditions."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/atopic-dermatitis/",
    "what_is_atopic_dermatitis": "Atopic dermatitis, often called atopic eczema, is a common skin condition that typically causes dry, scaly, itchy, inflamed skin. The condition is particularly common in children under 5 years old, but may persist into later life. Atopic dermatitis is also known as infantile atopic dermatitis or baby eczema when it affects infants and young children. Treatment typically involves keeping the skin moist and using creams or medications to soothe inflammation. Many children with atopic dermatitis will find that the condition improves over time, and that the symptoms of the condition disappear by adolescence. Some people, however, will experience atopic eczema into adulthood.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of atopic dermatitis will usually appear before the age of 5. Typical symptoms of the condition include: 1 Itchiness of the skin, which may intensify at nighttime Patches of red, inflamed skin Small bumps on the skin Skin flaking Atopic dermatitis is usually confined to one area of the body, though it can affect multiple areas in severe cases. Areas of skin which are near skin creases – such as the elbows, wrists, back of the knees and neck – are the most commonly affected areas. In infants, the face is the most commonly affected area. Thickened skin or scars can develop from scratching or rubbing. If the affected area becomes infected, thick, yellow pus, as well as redness and crusting may appear. The symptoms experienced, as well as the severity and duration of a flare-up, will differ from person to person. If you think you or a loved one might have atopic dermatitis, try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "causes": "The causes of atopic dermatitis are not yet fully understood. What is known is that the lipid (oily) barrier of skin is diminished in people with the condition and that substances, or cytokines, released by cells in the immune system may be a factor. The reason why these things affect some people and not others is unknown, however. 2 There is a genetic element to atopic dermatitis. If both parents have the condition, a child stands roughly an 80 percent chance of inheriting it themselves; if only one parent has the condition, this figure drops to 60 percent. 2\n\nAtopic dermatitis is a common condition, especially in children younger than 5 years old. It is uncommon to experience a first episode in adulthood. People with atopy – a predisposal to allergic conditions such as hay fever and allergic asthma , for example, tend to have a slightly higher chance of developing atopic dermatitis. Other factors that are known to trigger the condition include: Skin dryness Heat Perspiration Irritating substances, such as certain clothing or chemicals Emotional or physical stress Skin infections",
    "atopic_dermatitis_diagnosis": "A doctor or dermatologist will usually diagnose atopic dermatitis based on the symptoms and an examination of the affected skin. Skin or blood tests are not usually necessary to reach a diagnosis.",
    "atopic_dermatitis_treatment": "There is no cure for atopic dermatitis, meaning treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. In many cases, symptoms will naturally improve with age. The two main treatment methods for atopic dermatitis are: 1 2 3 Emollients, or moisturizers Steroid creams and ointments (topical steroids) Treatment for atopic dermatitis aims to reduce the number and severity of flare-ups by reducing skin irritation and promoting skin health.\n\nEmollients are lotions, creams, ointments and bathing additives that help to prevent the skin from becoming dry, one of the key characteristics of atopic dermatitis. Keeping the skin moist helps to protect the skin from various irritants, which reduces the number of flare-ups experienced. Depending on the severity of the condition, emollients may need to be applied between two and several times per day. They are most effective when applied directly after bathing – within three minutes – and should be applied liberally. 4 The most effective emollients are generally thick and contain little water, though a doctor, dermatologist or pharmacist will be able to advise on the best variety for each person. Good to know: It is advisable to manage atopic dermatitis using products which have been specifically recommended for the use of people with the condition. Many commercial skincare products contain perfumes, and/or other chemicals which could irritate sensitive skin.\n\nSteroid creams and ointments, otherwise known as topical steroids, are used to reduce skin inflammation. They come in various strengths, from mild to very potent, with the stronger varieties being more effective at treating inflammation but with a greater risk of side-effects. Possible side-effects include a mild stinging when applied, and, more rarely, thinning of the skin, skin discoloration, acne and increased hair growth. 3 For this reason, the long-term regular use of topical steroids is not recommended , and a course of this type of medication will typically need to be used for between 7 and 14 days. Commonly, a mild steroid will first be prescribed, followed by a stronger variety if the flare-up does not clear up within three to seven days. The cream or ointment will usually need to be applied liberally once or twice per day. In very severe cases, a short-course of steroid tablets may be prescribed to help manage symptoms when topical steroids have proven ineffective.\n\nAdditional treatment methods for atopic dermatitis include: 1 3 Antihistamine tablets; sometimes used to help manage the itching associated with atopic dermatitis. They can be very effective but tend to cause drowsiness in some people. Ultraviolet light therapy; generally only recommended for people who have not responded to other treatment methods due to the expense as well as the possible risk of skin cancer. Immunosuppressive drugs; sometimes used in severe cases when no other treatment methods have proven effective. Can cause serious side-effects, including an increased risk of infection. Wet dressings can be used to hydrate and soothe the skin during a flare-up.",
    "atopic_dermatitis_prevention": "Identifying and avoiding triggers that may cause symptoms to worsen can help in preventing episodes of atopic dermatitis. Triggers to avoid may include: Hot, dry environments Perspiration Certain chemicals and solutions, such as detergents, perfumes and cosmetics Wool or synthetic clothing Once triggers have been identified, a person’s doctor or dermatologist will be able to help with devising methods of avoiding them. Other methods of preventing atopic dermatitis from worsening include blotting the skin dry instead of rubbing after bathing as well as ensuring the fingernails of children are kept short to prevent wounds from scratching.",
    "atopic_dermatitis_complications": "The skin of people with atopic dermatitis is susceptible to infection. This infection can be both bacterial and viral in origin.\n\nSkin that has become cracked as a result of atopic dermatitis is prone to bacterial infection. If infected, the usual symptoms of the condition may become more severe and treatments may cease to be effective. Additional signs and symptoms of a bacterial skin infection include: 5 Fluid seeping from the skin A yellowish crust over the skin The development of small yellow-white spots on the affected area of skin Swollen and/or painful skin High temperature Generally feeling unwell Seek medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms appear. Antibiotics will typically be prescribed to treat the infection.\n\nPeople with atopic dermatitis are also susceptible to viral infections, particularly the herpes simplex virus . This can lead to a condition known as atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum. 6 Symptoms of atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum include: 5 Rapidly worsening areas of painful dermatitis Clusters of fluid-filled blisters which may burst to leave shallow open sores High temperature Generally feeling unwell Atopic dermatitis with eczema herpeticum requires urgent medical treatment. Contact a doctor immediately if any of the signs or symptoms appear.",
    "atopic_dermatitis_faqs": "Q: Do I need to see a specialist? A: In most cases, a general practitioner will be capable of diagnosing and treating atopic dermatitis. However, if the usual treatment methods prove ineffective, it is not clear what is causing the condition and/or the dermatitis is particularly severe, the affected person may be recommended to a dermatologist, a specialist skin doctor. A dermatologist will be able to give additional support, including helping to identify any triggers and devising alternative treatment methods. 3 Q: Are there any home treatment methods for atopic dermatitis? A: There are several ways in which to treat the symptoms of atopic dermatitis at home. These include using wet dressings – a piece of clothing or bandage soaked in water – to help keep the skin moist, bathing regularly – no more than once daily unless otherwise advised – and the use of over-the-counter emollients.",

    "condition": "Atrial fibrillation (AFib)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/atrial-fibrillation-afib/",
    "overview": "AFib is a heart rhythm condition that can occur with or without symptoms. AFib causes can include high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, and other non-cardiac causes such as stress, obesity, and poor management of underlying health conditions. There are several medical procedures available for atrial fibrillation.\n\nAFib is a heart rhythm condition that occurs frequently and is characterized by a racing, irregular heartbeat. In some cases, it can also occur without any symptoms. As it can lead to complications such as stroke, it’s essential to know the signs of atrial fibrillation, how it can be detected and diagnosed, and the possible and available treatment options.",
    "what_is_atrial_fibrillation_afib": "Atrial fibrillation , also known as AFib and often abbreviated as AF , is a heart rhythm condition that is marked by an irregular and often racing heartbeat. An irregular heart rhythm can cause serious health issues. Usually, the heart pumps blood throughout the body with a certain rhythm. With AFib, the irregular heart rhythm forms a problem for the heart’s normal function, as it won’t be able to pump out all the blood towards the rest of the body. The blood that remains in the heart can form clots , which can be pumped out of the heart and can block crucial blood vessels in other parts of the body, such as the brain. People who have atrial fibrillation and who aren’t receiving the appropriate treatment even run a risk of stroke due to these blood clots that are 5 times higher than the risk that other people may have. Atrial fibrillation life expectancy depends on whether or not the condition is being treated. 1 There are several types of atrial fibrillation , including: 1 Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , which is a form of atrial fibrillation that comes and goes and only lasts for a few minutes to hours and up to 7 days in some people. The heart rhythm often restores on its own without any treatment. Persistent atrial fibrillation , which is a form of atrial fibrillation that lasts for more than 7 days and requires treatment. Longstanding atrial fibrillation , which is a form of atrial fibrillation that lasts more than 12 months. Permanent atrial fibrillation , which is defined as an irregular heart rhythm that lasts indefinitely. For this type of atrial fibrillation, treatment for AFib won’t work anymore.",
    "how_common_is_atrial_fibrillation": "AFib is quite a common condition, with 1 in every 3 individuals older than 55 years being at risk of experiencing AFib at some point throughout their life. Atrial fibrillation also occurs more and more frequently. Studies estimate that in the United States alone, 6 to 12 million people will experience this condition by 2050 . 2 3",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "AFib symptoms can vary from person to person, with some not experiencing any symptoms. For others, some of the common signs of AFib include : 4 Heart palpitations A rapid and irregular heartbeat Tiredness and difficulty exercising Breathlessness Feeling faint Dizziness Weakness Chest pain Atrial fibrillation symptoms can vary in severity and frequency.",
    "what_is_the_leading_cause": "Many factors can contribute to AFib. What causes AFib is an issue with the heart's electrical signaling. When the signaling doesn't work as it should, the heart’s upper chambers start contracting irregularly, making it impossible for the upper and lower chambers of the heart to work together and pump blood around the body effectively. 5 The electrical signaling of the heart can be disturbed by a number of conditions, such as: 5 High blood pressure Coronary heart disease",
    "what_increases_the_risk": "Many factors can increase the risk of AFib. Some factors are modifiable, while you cannot do anything about some other factors. Some of these include: 5 Age : if you’re over 65, then your risk of atrial fibrillation increases Family history : if heart conditions or atrial fibrillation run in your family, then your risk increases as well People with European ancestry are more likely to develop atrial fibrillation Apart from these risk factors, there are several modifiable factors and non-cardiac causes of atrial fibrillation that should be taken into account as well: 5 Smoking Drinking alcohol Consuming illegal drugs Stress Strenuous activity Poor management of underlying health conditions such as COPD, chronic kidney disease , heart failure , high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism , sleep apnea , and diabetes Obesity",
    "how_can_atrial_fibrillation_be_diagnosed": "Your healthcare provider will ask questions to obtain your medical history and perform examinations to check your heart rate and rhythm. Atrial fibrillation can be detected on a variety of digital devices , wearables, and smartphone applications that use photoplethysmography ( PPG) or electrocardiogram ( ECG ). AFib will show signs of irregular rhythm on PPG and ECG . 6",
    "how_to_treat_atrial_fibrillation": "AFib treatment can include lifestyle changes, tackling underlying health issues, taking medicine, or undergoing a procedure to restore the heart rhythm to normal. Your healthcare provider will consider your medical history and symptoms to guide you to the correct atrial fibrillation treatments. Atrial fibrillation guidelines indicate that lifestyle changes and treating underlying health conditions are essential to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation. Some lifestyle changes may include: 7 Aiming for a healthy weight , as obesity is a significant risk factor for AFib Limiting the use of alcohol, nicotine, or any stimulants that may increase your heart rate Getting enough physical activity. However, keep in mind that long-term strenuous activity is not recommended. Managing stress , as this can also trigger AFib episodes. Atrial fibrillation medication is often aimed at avoiding stroke by preventing blood clots from forming. AFib medication can also slow down your heart rate or restore your heart’s normal rhythm. The drug of choice for atrial fibrillation depends on your medical history and underlying factors. Some examples of medicines that your healthcare provider may prescribe you are: 7 Beta-blockers Blood thinners Calcium channel blockers Heart rhythm medicines Other atrial fibrillation treatments can be recommended if lifestyle changes and medicine do not help improve your symptoms. Some of these procedures can include: 7 Atrial fibrillation cardioversion , which restores the heart rhythm using low-energy shocks. Atrial fibrillation catheter ablation , which restores the heart rhythm by destroying the tissue causing the arrhythmia. A pacemaker for AFib , which is usually only done if atrial fibrillation is diagnosed along with another arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation surgery can include surgery of the left upper chamber of the heart to help restore the heart’s normal rhythm.",
    "wrapping_up": "Atrial fibrillation is a heart rhythm condition that can lead to severe complications such as stroke. If the condition is detected early on and treatment initiated, complications can be prevented in many cases. Making lifestyle alterations, taking medication, and undergoing a procedure to restore the normal heart rhythm are possible AFib treatment options that may offer a solution if you’re experiencing symptoms of AFib.",
    "atrial_fibrillation_faqs": "Q: What is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation? A: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a form of atrial fibrillation that comes and goes and only lasts for a few days. The heart rhythm often restores on its own without any treatment. Q: What causes atrial fibrillation? A: Atrial fibrillation is caused by an issue with the electrical signaling of the heart. This causes the upper heart chambers to contract irregularly. Q: What does atrial fibrillation feel like? A: Atrial fibrillation can feel like a pounding, racing heartbeat, which you can feel in your chest. It’s sometimes also described as a fluttering feeling in the chest. Some people may also experience chest pain, dizziness, and fatigue. Q: Does atrial fibrillation go away? A: In some cases, atrial fibrillation can go away on its own, or it can go away after making lifestyle changes or by taking medicine. In other cases, however, a procedure may be necessary."

Although its causes are not fully understood, factors including genetics and antenatal problems are thought to play a role. 1 Treatment for the condition will generally involve a team of professionals experienced in child development and ADHD specifically. It may encompass parent-training and the setting of stricter boundaries at home, as well as behavioral therapy and medication. With adequate support, children with ADHD can learn to manage their symptoms effectively.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of ADHD may first be recognised by a parent, teacher or caregiver. They can in some cases be difficult to distinguish from age-appropriate energeticness and/or misbehavior. The core symptoms are persistent hyperactivity, inattention and/or impulsivity . These behaviors should be displayed in more than one setting – for example, at home and at school – and during more than one activity – for example, when doing schoolwork and when going to bed. To be classed as ADHD, the symptoms must: 1 First appear before the age of 12 Occur in more than one setting Occur for at least six months Interfere with social, academic and/or occupational activities Be unrelated to any other condition or disorder that the child may have The symptoms of ADHD tend to vary from child to child. There are, however, three key subtypes that most cases will fit into. 1 2 Hyperactive-impulsive subtype: Hyperactivity and impulsivity commonly occur together in young children with ADHD. This may mean that a child feels the need to move around constantly, talk a lot and may struggle with controlling their impulses. Inattention subtype: The main features of this subtype are difficulty paying attention and reduced cognitive ability. This may mean that a child is easily distracted, struggles to take in and follow instructions, and is forgetful. The symptoms of inattention will typically not become apparent until a child is eight or nine years old. 3 Combined subtype: Children with this subtype will display features of both the hyperactive and inattention subtypes. Hyperactivity in children with ADHD tends to fade after the age of eight or nine and may be difficult to detect to outside observers from then on. Adolescents, however, may still experience restlessness or find it difficult to settle down. Symptoms of impulsivity and inattention tend to persist throughout a person's life, although inattention may not be detectable until the age of eight or nine. People or parents of children experiencing symptoms that may be linked to ADHD can check their symptoms using the free Ada app .",
    "causes": "The exact cause of ADHD is not fully understood by medical professionals, though a number of factors are believed to play a role. Factors that are thought to contribute to ADHD include: 1 3 4 5 Brain function and structure: Research suggests that there are small differences in the brains of people with ADHD compared with the brains of people without the condition. The significance of this is not yet clear. Genetics: Research suggests that a child is more likely to develop ADHD if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, also has the condition. Learning issues: While learning issues do not cause ADHD, children with conditions such as dyslexia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia are more likely to also experience ADHD. Antenatal problems: If a mother smokes, drinks alcohol or takes drugs during pregnancy, this may increase the likelihood of the child having ADHD. Birth problems: If a child is born with a low birth weight, is deprived of oxygen during birth or experiences any other kind of issue during birth, this may increase their chance of developing ADHD. One or more of these factors may apply to a child with ADHD. Conversely, none of these factors may apply and there may be no clear cause of the condition.",
    "diagnosing_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd": "The diagnosis is usually made by a specialist pediatric doctor with experience in child development. There is no special test for ADHD; instead, a diagnosis will be based on the symptoms displayed and through an observation of the child’s interactions with their parents, siblings and, if possible, teachers and classmates. Seeking a formal diagnosis is important because it enables families and teachers to coordinate plans for managing behavior and education. People or parents of children experiencing symptoms that may be linked to ADHD can also check their symptoms using the free Ada app .",
    "treatment_for_attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd": "The way in which a child with ADHD is treated will depend on the severity of the condition as well as the age of the child. Treatment should be coordinated by a team of professionals, including pediatricians, ADHD specialists and behavioral therapists. The condition cannot be cured, but it can be effectively managed. The first stage of treatment will usually involve referral to a parent-training programme. The aim of this kind of training is to teach parents ways to manage behavioral problems, to understand the condition more thoroughly and to communicate more effectively with their child. These methods may also need to be taught to teachers and other caregivers, so activities can be tailored to suit the child’s attention span. 1 Other treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) , a method of psychological training that can help a child to understand why they act as they do and to come up with strategies to help manage their condition. All children, including those with ADHD, are recommended to get at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per day. Regular physical activity is associated with improved cardiovascular health, mental wellbeing and cognitive performance. Medication can also be prescribed to help treat ADHD in children over the age of six. Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed medication. It works by increasing the amount of dopamine released into the parts of the brain responsible for attention and self-control. A child may need to take medication for a number of years. 1 Medication is generally prescribed in severe cases of ADHD or in milder cases when other treatment options have not been effective. When used in children, ADHD medications are not thought to have an addictive potential. They can, however, cause side-effects. Possible side-effects of methylphenidate include: 6 A slight increase in blood pressure and heart rate Loss of appetite Sleeping problems Headaches Stomach aches Mood swings",
    "attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_adhd_in_adults": "According to studies, an estimated 40 to 60 percent of children with ADHD will continue to experience the condition into adulthood. 7 As a development disorder, however, it is thought that people cannot develop the condition for the first time as adults, though it may only be recognised and/or diagnosed for the first time once a person has reached adulthood. 4 Indeed, the rate of adults being diagnosed with ADHD is thought to be increasing significantly. 8 The symptoms and behaviors associated with ADHD in adults typically differ from those present in childhood. For adults, hyperactivity may manifest as persistent restlessness, and inattention as an inability to focus and carry out daily tasks. Adults with ADHD may find that the condition affects their ability to maintain employment and take care of their responsibilities; it may also result in financial and interpersonal difficulties. 7 Similarly to children, adults with ADHD are likely to be treated for the condition using a combination of medications and psychotherapy. Commonly prescribed medications include methylphenidate and amphetamine, while psychotherapy will usually focus on cognitive behavioral therapy. 7",

Although they are separate conditions with differing symptoms, many people are diagnosed with both simultaneously. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but genetics are thought to play a role. 9 Q: Are ADHD and ADD the same? A: ADD, or attention deficit disorder, is a type of ADHD. It is characterized primarily by the symptom of inattentiveness and does not include hyperactivity or impulsivity. 10 Q: Are ADHD and bipolar disorder related? A: ADHD and bipolar disorder are separate conditions. They do, however, have some overlapping symptoms, and many people are diagnosed with both simultaneously. Shared symptoms include hyperactivity, irritability, restlessness and impulsivity. The key difference between the two is that ADHD primarily affects behavior, whereas bipolar also affects a person’s mood. It is important for people with both conditions to be diagnosed accurately, as co-occurrence can affect the appropriateness of management techniques.

Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that people can experience a wide range of symptoms at varying degree of severity. 2\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified that one child in 59 in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder. 1 to 2 percent of American children have received a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Autism occurs in people of all ethnicities and is around four times more common in boys than in girls. 3 Symptoms of autism generally appear by the time a child is two years old. Autism cannot be cured but therapies and support services can help a person with autism improve symptoms. 2 4",
    "symptoms": "Autism is a spectrum disorder, which means that the signs and symptoms vary from person to person. Some of the more common symptoms of autism include: 5 Not making eye contact Delayed speech and communication skills Relying on rules and routines Becoming upset by changes to routines A narrow or obsessive range of interests Unexpected reactions to tastes, sounds, smells, sights and touch Difficulty understanding other people’s emotions Engaging in repetitive behavior such as flapping hands or rocking Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are usually noticeable and can be diagnosed by a medical professional by the time a child is two years old. Autism is diagnosed more frequently in males than females. In girls, symptoms of autism may be masked or missed, and the disorder is thought to be underdiagnosed. 6 7 8 Read more about Signs of Autism »",
    "other_conditions_related_to_autism": "Autism spectrum disorder is connected with various other conditions.\n\nBetween 40 and 55 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder also have a learning disability. The impact of learning difficulties on a person can range from needing support in school to needing support in all aspects of their daily life. 9 10\n\nAnxiety and anxiety disorder are often found in people with autism spectrum disorder. Anxiety can be increased by changes to routine or confusing social situations. This anxiety can be expressed as: General anxiety Phobias Obsessive-compulsive disorder Agoraphobia People with higher functioning levels of autism spectrum disorder seem more likely to have anxiety and anxiety disorders as well.\n\nUp to 70 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder also have some form of gastrointestinal condition, such as diarrhea or gastritis . Many people with autism also develop intense preferences for certain foods. 11 Where gastrointestinal problems cause pain and distress, this can cause the person to display frustrated and/or challenging behavior. If you are worried about gastrointestinal symptoms, try using the Ada app for a free assessment.\n\nIf a person with autism has chronic constipation, there could be a lack of fiber in their diet. There may be physical causes, such as problems in the gut or metabolism that should be referred to a medical professional if constipation continues.\n\nChronic diarrhea can be caused by food intolerances, such as lactose or gluten, in which case it is generally treated by restricting the diet. Chronic diarrhea should be assessed by a medical professional. Other causes of diarrhea include: 12 Crohn’s disease Irritable bowel syndrome Infections Medications\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach contents, including stomach acid, leak into the esophagus. This causes irritation and the burning sensation known as heartburn. Symptoms can be eased with medication such as antacids, eating smaller meals, or avoiding certain foods. A medical professional can discuss causes, prevention,n and treatment. 13\n\nAutism spectrum disorder and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) can be confused due to similar symptoms, such as: Inability to focus Impulsivity Hyperactivity Autism is a developmental disorder, whereas ADHD is a biological brain condition that is notable for a lack of attention and patterns of hyperactive and impulsive behavior. 14 15 One study showed that 20 percent of children with autism are initially diagnosed with ADHD. This delay in making the appropriate diagnosis of autism also delays interventions such as behavioral therapy and skills training. 16\n\nPervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is a condition now considered part of autism spectrum disorder by the DSM-5. Symptoms of PDD-NOS have significant overlap with ADHD . PDD-NOS can be given as a diagnosis for a developmental disorder that does not also meet the criteria for a named developmental disorder, such as autism, Asperger syndrome or Rett syndrome. PDD-NOS is likely to be the diagnosis where a person has: Impairment in social interaction Difficulties with communication A narrow range of interests Repetitive behaviors\n\nDifficulty sleeping is common among children and teenagers with autism spectrum disorder. This may be caused by an underlying medical issue, such as gastrointestinal distress or sleep apnea , or poor sleep hygiene and bedtime routines. 17\n\nAround 20 to 38 percent of children with autism spectrum disorder will have developed epilepsy by the time they become adults. Children who develop epilepsy alongside autism are at a higher risk if they also have a learning disability. The link between epilepsy and autism is thought to come from shared underlying causes. 18 19 Read more about Seizures »\n\nFragile X syndrome is a genetic development disorder which causes learning disability. The extent of the learning disability can range from mild to severe. People with Fragile X syndrome have an increased risk of also developing autism. 20\n\nTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to form in various organs, particularly the brain. Tumors in the brain can lead to seizures, developmental delays, and learning difficulties. One study found that approximately 1 percent of children with autism also have tuberous sclerosis complex. 21 22\n\nPeople with Asperger syndrome are generally considered to be on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum. It is a type of autism and is a lifelong condition. Someone with Asperger syndrome may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or adulthood, as people with the condition often have excellent language skills. Signs that someone has Asperger syndrome can include: 23 Narrow range of interests or obsession with certain topics Difficulties with social situations and communication with others Places high value on rules and routines Read more about Asperger Syndrome »",
    "causes": "It is unclear what causes autism, though scientists believe genetics and environment are involved. Around 85 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder can be classed as idiopathic, meaning the cause is not known. The remaining 15 percent of people have secondary autism spectrum disorder, where a specific cause can be identified. 24\n\nIn up to 25 percent of people with autism spectrum disorder, the condition is thought to have a genetic cause. Over 100 genes, many of which concern brain development, may be involved in causing autism. 25 26 27\n\nAutism can run in families, although it is unclear why. The brother of a child with autism has a 7 percent chance of developing autism, with an additional 7 percent chance of developing less severe autism spectrum symptoms. The sister of a child with autism has a 1 to 2 percent chance of developing autism plus the additional chance of less severe autism spectrum symptoms. 24 25 Other genetic disorders, such as ADNP syndrome, can cause autism. 28\n\nValproic acid is used to treat seizures, and mania in people with bipolar disorder , and to prevent migraine headaches . Taking valproic acid during pregnancy increases the risk that the child will be born with serious birth defects and that the child will develop an autism spectrum disorder. 29 30 Thalidomide is used to treat a type of cancer called multiple myeloma . It is well known that thalidomide carries a risk of severe birth defects when taken by a person who is pregnant. Thalidomide can also be transmitted to a fetus through semen. Contact with thalidomide before birth increases the risk a child will develop autism spectrum disorder. 31 Misoprostol is used to prevent ulcers. It can also be used to induce labor and, in high enough doses, terminate pregnancy in its early stages. There is some evidence to suggest that misoprostol use in the first trimester of pregnancy could cause autism spectrum disorder. 32\n\nWhen a pregnant person is exposed to the rubella virus during the first trimester, the fetus has a high chance of developing congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). This condition can cause deafness, microcephaly, congenital heart disease, and learning difficulties. Congenital rubella syndrome is also associated with higher than usual incidences of autism spectrum disorder. 33 CRS is very rare in the United States because of its policy for universal immunization against rubella. A study estimated that over 1,000 cases of autism spectrum disorder were prevented by rubella vaccination in the U.S. between 2001 and 2010. 34\n\nChildren born to older parents are more likely to develop autism, the risk heightening with the parents’ age. The risk increases significantly for each additional 10 years in maternal and paternal age. 35 36\n\nA study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a connection between autism spectrum disorder and the amount of time between births for each mother. The study found that children who were conceived less than 18 months or more than 59 months (4 years and 11 months) after the previous birth were more likely to develop autism.\n\nThere has been extensive research on vaccines and autism, and all scientific evidence indicates there is no link between autism and vaccines. 37",
    "diagnosis": "In the DSM-5, autism spectrum disorder now covers conditions that used to be classified separately: 5 Asperger syndrome Autistic disorder Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) Childhood disintegrative disorder A person needs to meet all DSM-5 criteria to receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. These criteria include: 38 Persistent difficulties in social communication and social interaction in many contexts At least two examples of restricted interests or repetitive behavior Signs must have been present in the early years of life Symptoms cause significant problems in social, working, or other functioning Symptoms cannot be explained by other learning or developmental disorders Some diagnostic tests that may be used to screen for autism spectrum disorder include: 24 38 M-CHAT-R (Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised) CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) GARS (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale) ABC (Autism Behavior Checklist) Social Communication Questionnaire ADOS (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised) A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder will be accompanied by an assessment of severity level, which can determine how much support a person will require.\n\nSome children with autism spectrum disorder display signs within the first few months, others after 24 months old. Up to 90 percent of children with autism display signs before two years of age, but most are diagnosed between the ages of three and five. Some children may develop according to normal patterns but stop developing around 18 to 24 months or lose skills they had already developed. 5 It may be helpful to keep a diary of behaviors, habits and incidents about a child with suspected autism. Record what happened where and anything notable that occured before the incident. 39 The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends reviewing children’s development at all early-years health checks and screening specifically for autism spectrum disorder at the 18-month and 24-month checks. 40 If autism spectrum disorder is suspected, other health professionals will carry out an assessment. These can include: 2 Developmental pediatrician Psychologist Neurologist Speech therapist Blood and hearing tests may also be carried out to eliminate other potential causes for the symptoms, such as 2 Genetic disorders which can affect the development Lead poisoning, which can cause developmental and behavioral problems Hearing difficulties, which may explain a lack of response\n\nChildren with less severe forms of autism spectrum disorder may find their symptoms first becoming noticeable at school. For example, a child may find it difficult to form friendships or recognize social cues like sarcasm or jokes. 2 Schools will communicate with parents or carers and may perform an initial evaluation, or recommend visiting a health professional.\n\nSome people do not receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder until adulthood. This can be due to complicating factors, such as the person being on the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum, having other disorders, or being misdiagnosed. People with autism can be misdiagnosed with ADHD , obsessive-compulsive disorder , depression , or anxiety . 41 42 If autism is suspected in an adult, a doctor should refer the person to a psychologist, psychiatrist, or neuropsychologist who has experience with autism spectrum disorder. A diagnosis of autism may be reached after taking a history of the person’s life and interaction with others, as well as potentially talking to family members who may remember details of the person’s early development. 2 A diagnosis of autism as an adult can provide the person with an explanation for previous difficulties and offer the opportunity for self-understanding and access to services.\n\nWhere there is a family history of autism spectrum disorder or physical evidence of another genetic disorder present, gene testing or chromosome analysis may be carried out. 24\n\nMore people are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. However, a variety of factors may be affecting the rate of this increase: More awareness of autism among caregivers leads to more referrals Broader diagnostic criteria Better awareness of diagnostic criteria among medical professionals There may also be a genuine increase in the number of individuals with autism. However, at present, it is unclear what is behind the statistics. 43",
    "treatment": "There is no standard treatment for autism spectrum disorder. However, there are therapies available that aim to minimize the symptoms of autism and allow the person to function as well as they can. Intervention and treatment can improve external symptoms and how a person copes with sensory and perception differences. However, how someone processes sensory information such as sounds and smells will always be different from people without the condition. 44 Although treatment, particularly behavioral therapy and skills training, is most effective when started young, any person at any age can benefit from appropriate treatment. Which treatments are appropriate will depend on the person, what they have difficulty with, and the severity of their symptoms. 45\n\nIn the U.S., early intervention services are available for children up to three years old with developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. These services focus on: 46 45 Language development Help with walking and coordination Interacting with others Recognizing and managing emotions\n\nThere is no cure for autism spectrum disorder. However, people with autism can learn coping skills to help them function better on a day-to-day basis. Carers and others who interact with people with autism can also help by managing their own behavior and environment.\n\nTherapy for autism spectrum disorder aims to decrease unwanted behaviors and increase wanted behaviors. There are various types of therapy available. The most appropriate will depend on the needs and symptoms of the person with autism. A medical professional will be able to offer guidance on which are likely to provide the most benefit. Many therapies involve the whole family so that family members can learn how to support and help the person with autism. In young children, effective interventions should involve around 25 hours a week of active engagement. 17 Therapies for autism spectrum disorder include: 17 45 46 Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): Helps people recognize the connection between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors Behavioral management therapy: Uses various techniques to teach skills which improve social skills and reduce problematic behaviors Occupational therapy: Helps with skills, such as getting dressed or skills needed for employment Social skills training: Can help children cope with conversations and other social interactions\n\nMany people with autism spectrum disorder experience delays in learning to talk, with up to 50 percent being nonverbal. Being able to communicate by speech by the time a child goes to school has been linked to more positive outcomes as the child grows into adulthood. Early intervention is, therefore, important. 47 Speech-language therapy can help a person with autism express needs, desires, and feelings. It can also improve a person’s vocabulary and speed of speech. 48\n\nIf a person with autism spectrum disorder displays challenging behaviors, there are various courses of potential action to take: 49 Have the person tested to check for medical problems that could be causing distress Behavioral therapy Reward positive behavior Communicate simply, to minimize frustration Reduce sensory overload Offer cues to redirect behavior such as verbal or gentle physical instruction Provide relaxation opportunities Be consistent and encourage others to do the same Some challenging behaviors can be mitigated by allowing the behavior, but changing an element to make it more socially acceptable. If a person smears feces because they enjoy the sensation, replace the feces with a substance such as Play-Doh or cornflour mixed with water. With pica, inappropriate items can be replaced with something edible and nutritious. 50\n\nRepetitive behaviors such as hand flapping or rocking may help a person with autism spectrum disorder. However, some repetitive behaviors, such as head banging, could cause the person harm. Other behaviors may cause distractions, such as in school, or can be problematic if engaged in often to block out external sensory input. Ways to manage unhelpful repetitive behavior include: 51 52 Behavioral therapy Replacing harmful activities with safer activities Change the environment to reduce distressing sensory input Introduce other forms of stimulation, such as calming activities\n\nPeople with autism are often highly reliant on routine. A visual timetable that shows what is going to happen during an activity, outing or a day can provide reassurance and prevent stress. Pictograms and simple instructional diagrams in soft colors can provide information to people with autism spectrum disorder. Such signs can indicate what room a person is in, or how to operate an appliance or window. Visual supports can also provide a way to communicate for people with autism who are nonverbal. Cards of various colors or with simple pictograms can indicate a need, desire or mood. 53\n\nPeople with autism spectrum disorder process sensory information, such as touch, sight, taste, sound, and smell, differently from people without the condition. Certain toys can provide sensory feedback and, while not a treatment, may help a person with autism focus or feel relaxed. Examples of such toys include: Fidget toys Stress balls Bubble wands or machines Sorting and matching games Toy trains Jigsaws Tactile books Construction bricks\n\nAs social awareness of autism spectrum disorder grows, more public places accommodate people with autism. This can include: 54 55 Relaxed theatre performances with reduced noise and light levels, and more freedom to move around Specific museum and gallery visiting hours with dimmer lights, fewer people, and break areas Autism-friendly times at shopping malls and supermarkets, with fewer people and no background music\n\nThere are no medications that can cure autism spectrum disorder, but some medications may help ease symptoms. Medication is often used to manage a behavior if it threatens to cause harm to the person, such as head banging or slapping. The FDA has approved aripiprazole and risperidone for use in autistic teenagers and children older than five years old. These medications can reduce hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors. 56 57 Other medications that can be used to treat some symptoms of autism include: 58 Antidepressants, including tricyclics and SSRIs: Can reduce anxiety, irritability and aggression Anti-anxiety medication: Can reduce anxiety and panic Stimulants: Can help increase focus for people with less severe symptoms\n\nIt is common to find gastrointestinal problems in people with autism spectrum disorder. Treatment involves diagnosing and treating the underlying issue which is causing the gastrointestinal distress. Exclusion diets, such as not eating gluten or casein, should not be used unless the person has a specific gastrointestinal problem, and dietary changes are recommended by a doctor. A large study found that, on the whole, children with autism that are given vitamin supplements do not need these supplements and may develop too-high levels of vitamins such as vitamin A and folate. 59 60",
    "autism_prognosis": "Autism spectrum disorder is a lifelong condition with no cure. However, intervention and therapy, particularly when begun early in life, can equip a person with autism with more life and emotional skills to help them manage. Depending on where a person fits on the autism spectrum, they may be able to live independently. A small number of people with autism go on to take university courses. A person towards the lower end of the autism spectrum may need lifelong help with daily tasks. 61 Employment may present a challenge for adults with autism. People towards the higher functioning end of the spectrum may need adjustments to the work environment, such as lights that do not flicker or a quiet space to work in. Some people towards the lower functioning end of the autism spectrum may never be capable of holding down a job. Types of employment that may be suitable for people with autism include: 62 Computer programming Accounting Photography Mechanics and engineering Sorting and assembly work",

    "autism_faqs": "Q: How do I know if my kid has autism? A: There are many different signs that a child might have autism. It is a spectrum disorder, meaning that the symptoms differ from one person to another and vary in severity. There are some common signs, such as avoiding eye contact, finding social interactions difficult, being reliant on routines, and getting upset at minor changes or certain smells, tastes, sounds, or lights. Parents are often the first people to notice symptoms, but a diagnosis can only be made by a team of experienced specialists. Q: Are autism rates going up? A: The number of people being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is increasing. However, it is unclear whether this is because there are more people with autism or whether parents, caregivers, schools, and doctors are more aware of autism symptoms. This can lead to more people with autism being diagnosed, whereas, in the past, they might not have received a diagnosis. Q: Are autism and ADHD related? A: Autism and ADHD share some symptoms. Some people with autism are misdiagnosed with ADHD before receiving the correct diagnosis. Autism and ADHD are different conditions, though people with both can display fidgety behavior, struggle with social skills, react unusually to sensory input, and experience outbursts due to frustration. See the section on ADHD and autism . Q: Are autism and Asperger syndrome the same? A: Asperger syndrome is a condition that is classified as an autism spectrum disorder. Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that people can have autism but show different symptoms of differing severity. People with Asperger syndrome are generally towards the higher functioning end of the autism spectrum. See the section on Asperger syndrome. Q: Can autism be cured? A: There is no cure for autism. It is a lifelong condition. However, with appropriate intervention, a person with autism spectrum disorder can learn to manage their behaviors and emotions and have a better quality of day-to-day life. See the section on treatment. Q: What diet should someone with autism and gastrointestinal problems have? A: It is common for people with autism to experience gastrointestinal problems. Discomfort can cause distress and difficult behavior, prompted by the underlying gastrointestinal medical condition. A doctor should be consulted to find the underlying cause. (See the section on gastrointestinal problems .) No particular diet has been shown to affect symptoms of autism itself."

    "what_is_baby_eczema_infant_eczema": "Baby eczema, or infant eczema, is a highly common and treatable skin condition which typicallyfirst occurs in children before the age of five. Also known as atopic eczema, infantile atopic dermatitis or just atopicdermatitis , the condition results in red, dry, itchy and cracked skin that may sometimescrack and bleed. 1 Eczema can affect the whole body, though the hands, face and neck are the most commonly affected areas in babies. Baby eczema will generally disappear before the child reaches their teens, but in some casescan continue into teenage and adulthood. The condition can be treated with a variety of creams,ointments and minor environmental changes.",
    "symptoms": "Eczema in babies appears as dry, red, scaly, itchy and flaky skin. In young babies, the scalp,face, ears and neck are the most commonly affected areas. In older babies, the arms and legsmay be more commonly affected, especially around the elbows and knees, as well as the diaperarea. 2 In severe cases, baby eczema can cause painful cracking of the skin, with oozingand bleeding. As children get older, the skin that is affected by the condition normallybecomes less red but scalier, leatherier and thicker – this is known as lichenification andmay also occur as a result of persistent scratching. 3 If your baby is experiencing possible symptoms of baby eczema, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app now.",
    "causes_and_triggers": "The causes of baby eczema are unclear, though it is generally agreed that the conditionstems from a mixture of genetic and environmental factors. 4 Knowing what triggers babyeczema can be useful in keeping the condition under control. Common triggers include: Dry skin: When the skin becomes too dry it becomes susceptible to rashes and flare-ups of eczema. Moisture on the skin: From sweat, milk, saliva or wet diapers. Chemical irritants: Natural or artificial chemicals found in everyday products canmake an outbreak of eczema more likely. These chemicals can be found in products such asshampoo, soap, laundry detergent and disinfectants or surface cleaners. Dust mites: Some research shows that prolonged exposure to dust mites increases thelikelihood of an infant developing eczema. Further research in the area suggests thatreducing the number of dust mites in the home makes little difference to the frequencyand severity of eczema flares after the first diagnosis. 5 Stress: Babies can become extremely irritated by eczema which can in turn exacerbatethe condition further.",
    "diagnosing_baby_eczema": "Diagnosing eczema in babies is relatively easy due to the visibility and characteristicappearance of the condition. A doctor will examine the baby and judge whether the symptomsare a result of eczema ( atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis , which results from exposureto allergens or irritants and can usually be treated quickly.",
    "baby_eczema_treatment": "As soon as the presence of baby eczema becomes apparent, treatment options should be exploredquickly to avoid the condition spreading or becoming more severe. Understanding and avoidingthe potential causes and triggers of baby eczema is key to managing the condition, but avariety of further options are also available. 6 In particularly severe cases, a consultationwith a specialist dermatologist may be necessary.\n\nUsing a moisturizing ointment or cream to keep the skin soft and moist is key to tacklingbaby eczema. 7 Moisturizers are classified according to their oil and water content, withthe most effective moisturizers containing a higher amount of oil. Ointments and barrier creams should be applied to the skin in a thick layer at least twiceper day and immediately after bathing. They can be bought over the counter at the pharmacyor be prescribed by a doctor.\n\nMild topical steroids (steroids applied to the skin) can be used to reduce the redness andsoreness of baby eczema flare-ups. 8 These steroids are perfectly safe when applied correctlyand under the guidance of a healthcare professional. They are, however, generally intendedfor short-term use, unless otherwise advised by a doctor.\n\nUnscented, additive-free and dye-free cleansers only should be used on babies experiencingeczema. A range of such products are available and should be used in conjunction withmoisturizing ointments or topical steroids. It is generally advised that a doctor’s opinionshould be sought before using these products.\n\nAn appropriate bathing routine is critical to treating baby eczema. Baths are recommendedover showers and should be warm rather than hot and last no longer than 10 minutes. Theyshould also be followed by the application of prescribed topical lotions and ointments.",
    "baby_eczema_faqs": "Q: Will my child grow out of eczema? A: In most cases, yes. Eczema generally develops in children from the age of twomonths and peters out by around three years-old. However, some children can experienceeczema into the teenage years and even into adulthood. 9 Q: Are there any home remedies that can be used to treat baby eczema? A: There are a number of home remedies that can be used to treat some of the symptomsof baby eczema. However, it is generally a good idea to seek a doctor’s opinion and followthe treatment path outlined. Bathing in water mixed with oatmeal, using a humidifier andthe application of coconut oil are among the most common home remedies. 10 Q: What does the term “atopic” mean? A: Atopic (as in atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) refers to a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions such as eczema, asthma or hay fever. 1 Atopic eczema in babies and atopic dermatitis in babies are simply synonyms of baby eczema. Q: What is dermatitis? A: Dermatitis is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that cause inflammation of the skin. Although the different types of dermatitis have differing causes, most involve the onset of red, itchy and dry skin or a rash. Baby eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is one form of dermatitis. Others include contact dermatitis (caused by the skin coming into contact with irritants) and seborrheic dermatitis (which can cause a flare-up of red skin, scaly patches and dandruff). 11 Q: What is the relationship between food allergies and baby eczema? A: Food allergies are common in infants with eczema. However, they are separate conditions and it is not accurate to say that food allergies cause eczema. Instead, it appears that having eczema may increase the chances of an infant developing allergies to certain foods. A flare-up of both conditions may cause a rash or red, itchy skin, however, eczema is typically focussed on specific parts of the body (hands, face, neck) while an allergic reaction is more unpredictable. 12"

    "what_is_bacterial_conjunctivitis": "Conjunctivitis is the name for inflammation of the conjunctiva; this is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids that covers the white part of the eye. Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by bacteria, a virus (viral conjunctivitis), or allergies (allergic conjunctivitis). If pink eye is caused by bacteria, it is called bacterial conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, bacterial conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious. 1 2 3 4 5\n\nOne or both eyes can be affected. The main symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis include: 2 3 4 1 Pinkness or redness of the eye Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye Thick, sticky discharge from the eye Swollen and/or reddened eyelids If you think that you might have pink eye, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis clear up on their own, within a week or two and without any specific treatment. Cleaning the eyes throughout the day with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antibiotic eye drops or ointments may be recommended, particularly for more severe cases of bacterial conjunctivitis. 1 2 3 4 Generally, people make a complete recovery, and the condition does not cause any complications. However, if bacterial conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer , it can be very serious, and medical advice should be sought without delay. 1 In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include: 4 1 Intense pain in the eye Extreme redness in the eye Inability to open the eye Severe sensitivity to light Blurred vision that persists after wiping away discharge Furthermore, if symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought. Bacterial conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, but it is more common in children than adults. 4 It is very contagious, which means that it can be spread easily from person to person. For this reason, it is important for people who have bacterial conjunctivitis to take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practicing good hygiene.",
    "symptoms": "Bacterial conjunctivitis often begins in one eye and then spreads to the other. Symptoms may include: 1 3 4 Pinkness or redness in the eye Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye Increased watering of the eye Thick, sticky, often yellowish discharge from the eye; this can form a “crust” at night, making the eyes feel as if they are glued shut in the morning Swollen eyelids Slight sensitivity to bright light Swelling of the lymph nodes in front of the ears Bacterial conjunctivitis usually only causes mild symptoms and does not affect a person’s vision, other than causing slight blurriness when discharge has built up on and around the eye. 4 Depending on the type of bacteria causing the infection, there may be additional symptoms. If you are worried that you may have pink eye, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. If symptoms are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay. It is also extremely important to see a doctor if any signs of bacterial conjunctivitis are present in a newborn baby.",
    "causes": "The most common causes of bacterial conjunctivitis are the following types of bacteria: 4 Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus pneumonia Haemophilus influenzae; this is not the same as the flu , which is caused by a virus Less commonly, the infection can be the result of the following sexually transmitted infections (STIs): 4 Chlamydia Gonorrhea Bacterial conjunctivitis caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea is more serious and requires treatment by a doctor.",
    "diagnosis": "When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important. A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether anyone they know might have had an eye infection recently. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out acute viral conjunctivitis , allergic conjunctivitis , and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis . 3 5 4 In most cases, it will not be necessary to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, in cases that are severe or do not respond to treatment, as well as in the case of infants, the doctor may take a small swab from the eyelid and test it to determine the cause of the infection and ensure that the treatment approach is correct. 6 7 5",
    "treatment_for_bacterial_conjunctivitis": "Mild cases of bacterial conjunctivitis often clear up within 1-2 weeks without special medical treatment. The following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by conjunctivitis: 1 7 4 1 Gently clean discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad, or cotton wool soaked in water Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye; care must be taken not to use the drops in the other eye if only one eye is infected Applying a cold or warm compress, a clean cloth that has been soaked in water, to the eye Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the infection has cleared\n\nAntibiotic eye drops or eye ointment may help to clear up the infection more quickly. However, they are not always needed, and many cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis will resolve on their own, without antibiotic treatment. Topical antibiotics are typically recommended for more severe or persistent cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, with eye drops usually preferred over ointments for ease of use. Less commonly, where the cause of bacterial conjunctivitis is chlamydia or gonorrhea , a course of oral or injected antibiotics may be necessary. 4",
    "complications": "Most cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis clear up completely, without causing any complications. However, in a small number of severe cases, the infection can cause serious complications, including: 4 Ulcers on the cornea of the eye Damage to vision Otitis media , an ear infection If a person experiences any severe symptoms or is concerned about an eye infection, it is recommended that they see a doctor without delay.",
    "bacterial_conjunctivitis_in_newborns": "Infants can be affected by various types of conjunctivitis, including bacterial conjunctivitis. Pink eye in newborns is called neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum. Babies with bacterial conjunctivitis typically develop puffy, red eyelids and discharge from the eyes within 1-14 days of birth. 3 A baby’s eyes may become infected with bacteria from the mother during the childbirth process, including the common varieties listed above, as well as, less commonly, chlamydia and gonorrhea. Bacterial conjunctivitis in babies can be very serious and requires urgent medical attention. It is treated with antibiotics and may require referral to a specialist. 3 4 Conjunctivitis in babies is sometimes mistaken for sticky eyes caused by a blocked tear duct. However, a blocked tear duct will not cause redness or swelling. 4",
    "prevention": "While it may not always be possible to prevent bacterial conjunctivitis, taking the following steps can help to reduce the likelihood of an infection: 1 Avoiding contact with people who have pink eye Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer Avoiding touching your eyes when your hands are not clean If you have bacterial conjunctivitis, the following actions can help avoid spreading the infection to others: 1 6 Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer, especially after treating the eyes Cleaning your spectacles Avoiding touching the eyes other than when treating them, as this can spread the bacteria Washing pillowcases and towels often and avoiding sharing them with others Avoiding sharing makeup and eyedrops When necessary, staying off school or work until symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis have cleared; this is generally when the eyes are no longer red and irritated Avoiding the use of swimming pools In addition, contact lenses should not be worn until symptoms have cleared, and a new pair should be used when the infection has gone away. Some makeup may also need to be discarded and replaced to prevent reinfection. 1",
    "other_names_for_bacterial_conjunctivitis": "Bacterial eye infection Pink eye, or pinkeye",
    "bacterial_conjunctivitis_faqs": "Q: Viral vs. bacterial conjunctivitis – what is the difference? A: While both types of conjunctivitis are highly contagious, the causes, some of the symptoms, and the treatments are different. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a virus, often from the group of viruses that cause the common cold, results in a watery discharge from the eye, and has no specific treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by bacteria, often types of staphylococcus or streptococcus, is spread through poor hygiene or contact with other people or insects, results in a thick, sticky discharge from the eye, and may – in some cases – require antibiotic eye drops. 6 7 2 If you think that you may have a type of pink eye, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Q: My child has bacterial conjunctivitis. Is it necessary to keep them home from school? A: It depends on the region and institution. Some experts feel that a child should not be required to stay at home with bacterial conjunctivitis unless an outbreak of multiple cases has occurred. However, a particular daycare center or school may have its own policy and ask that a child with bacterial conjunctivitis be kept at home until their symptoms have cleared up, to reduce the likelihood of infecting other children. 4"

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-gastroenteritis/",
    "what_is_bacterial_gastroenteritis": "Bacterial gastroenteritis is a type of gastroenteritis – a common condition sometimes called stomach flu or food poisoning. Gastroenteritis is the result of irritation and inflammation in the stomach and intestines. It can have many different possible causes, including infection with a virus, such as rotavirus, bacteria or parasites. When caused by bacteria, it is called bacterial gastroenteritis . The condition can affect adults and children. Symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis can range from mild to severe and vary depending on the type of bacteria that have caused the infection. The main symptom is usually diarrhea. Other symptoms may include: 1 2 3 4 Abdominal (belly) pain or cramps Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Fever In severe cases, blood in the stool (feces); if blood is present, medical attention should be sought as a matter of urgency.\n\nBacterial stomach flu can be caused by several different types of bacteria, which are most often spread through contaminated food and beverages. Depending on the source of infection, a large group of people may develop symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis, or food poisoning, at the same time. 2 3 5 While it can be very unpleasant, most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis can be treated at home, and clear up within a few days without causing complications. 1 6 Treatment for bacterial gastroenteritis typically involves: ref1 2 3 4 5 Resting at home Drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration When necessary, taking medication to relieve nausea and diarrhea. Antibiotics are generally only recommended for more severe types of bacterial gastroenteritis.",
    "symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis include: 1 2 3 5 Diarrhea Abdominal (belly) discomfort , pain or cramps Bloating Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Fever and chills Body aches Headache Dizziness Feeling of weakness In severe cases, blood in the stool (feces). Symptoms may be mild or more severe, and vary depending on the type of bacteria. If you think that you might have stomach flu, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. If symptoms are severe or do not improve within 2-3 days, it is important to contact a doctor without delay. Furthermore, medical attention should be sought immediately if: There are any indications of severe dehydration, such as passing little to no urine or dizziness that does not go away There is blood, pus or a black color in the diarrhea There is constant vomiting that makes it impossible to keep down fluids There is very intense abdominal pain There is a fever over 38 degrees Celsius (101 F), in adults or children In addition, a doctor should be contacted urgently if the affected person: Is pregnant Is a very young child Is an elderly person Has a weakened immune system Has a chronic condition such as inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes .",
    "causes": "Stomach flu can be caused by many different bacteria, including: 2 3 5 Salmonella Campylobacter Shigella Escherichia coli (E.coli) Yersinia Staphylococcus Clostridium difficile. In some cases, the bacteria may be transmitted directly from one person to another, but they are typically spread through contaminated food and water. Sources of bacterial stomach bugs include: 2 3 5 Unhygienic food preparation, e.g. a cook not washing their hands after going to the toilet, or using the same cutting boards for both meat and salads Raw or undercooked meat, eggs and fish Unpasteurized dairy and juices Inadequately-treated drinking water. Bacterial food poisoning can also be contracted from food that is not stored properly, e.g. poor refrigeration that leads to food spoiling, as well as from raw fruits and vegetables that are not thoroughly washed in clean water. Contact with reptiles, birds and amphibians can also be a route of transmission for Salmonella bacteria.\n\nBacterial gastroenteritis is a common cause of traveler’s diarrhea, a condition which frequently affects overseas travelers , particularly in developing countries. It is often the result of inadequate food hygiene at local restaurants and food outlets. 7 For more information on traveler’s diarrhea, including when to see a doctor, see the FAQs section .\n\nSome cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are not caused by bacteria themselves, but instead by toxins that they release. The harmful byproducts of certain types of bacteria can contaminate food, causing a type of food poisoning when ingested. These byproducts are called exotoxins, and they usually cause symptoms within 12 hours of consuming the contaminated food. This type of gastroenteritis typically clears up within 36 hours. 8",
    "diagnosis": "When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. 1 However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important. A doctor will take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination, taking care to rule out other gastrointestinal conditions such as gastritis . In most cases, it will not be necessary to order tests to confirm the diagnosis of gastroenteritis. However, in cases that are severe or long-lasting, a doctor may request blood tests and/or stool tests. 1 2 3",
    "bacterial_gastroenteritis_treatment": "Most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis clear up without specific medical treatment. As long as symptoms are not severe and there are no signs of dehydration, a person can generally treat bacterial gastroenteritis in an adult or child at home.\n\nThe following home remedies and over-the-counter treatment approaches are recommended for mild cases of bacterial stomach flu: 1 9 Bed rest Consuming plenty of fluids in the form of water or oral rehydration drinks; at the very least, small sips should be taken between being sick or having bowel movements Eating light meals when the appetite returns; plain foods like bread and rice may be helpful Taking an antidiarrheal medication, e.g. loperamide, only when necessary and there is no fever, and no blood or mucus is present in the stool Taking antiemetic (anti-nausea) medicine for nausea and vomiting, when necessary. 10\n\nIf a person is unable to keep any fluids down or shows signs of dehydration (see below), they may need to be treated with an IV drip at a hospital.\n\nIn mild cases of bacterial gastroenteritis, antibiotics are typically not considered necessary and will not be prescribed. Antibiotic medication is generally only recommended in severe or persistent cases of bacterial food poisoning, in some cases of traveler’s diarrhea, in infections with C. difficile and in cases where the person has a weakened immune system or is otherwise at risk of complications. The type of antibiotics needed will depend on the specific type of bacteria, which may need to be determined with laboratory tests. 2 11",
    "complications": "Generally, a bout of bacterial gastroenteritis clears up completely, without causing any complications. In a few cases, there may be complications. The risk of developing complications from bacterial gastroenteritis is highest in very young children, elderly people, and people who have a chronic condition such as diabetes , or who have a weakened immune system. 1 6 3 If stomach flu occurs in these groups of people, medical advice should be sought without delay. In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. 1 6 3 4\n\nDehydration is the most common complication of bacterial gastroenteritis. 1 6 Dehydration may present with the following signs and symptoms in adults: 12 Urinating less and dark colored urine Dry mouth Tiredness Dizziness Headache Muscle cramps Eyes appear sunken in the head Weakness. Additional signs which may help to identify dehydration in children include: 12 Drowsiness or irritability Increased heart rate Fewer wet nappies No tears when crying. If signs and symptoms of dehydration do not go away with the replacement of lost fluids, or if a person is unable to keep fluids down,  a doctor should be seen immediately. Dehydration can be extremely serious.\n\nOther complications of bacterial stomach flu may include: 1 6 3 Reduced effectiveness of medications, e.g. birth control pills or diabetes medicine Temporary intolerance to lactose, the sugar in cow’s milk Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) Rare complications from bacterial gastroenteritis include: 1 6 2 3 Reactive inflammation in other parts of the body, causing conditions like reactive arthritis The infection spreading to other parts of the body, e.g. the bones, joints, gallbladder, or the tissue around the brain and spinal cord (meninges) Persistent diarrhea Hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious condition characterized by anemia and kidney failure Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract Guillain-Barre syndrome, a serious condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the nerves. 13",
    "prevention": "Good personal hygiene and food preparation hygiene, as well as safe food storage and the use of water only from clean, adequately-treated sources, can help to reduce the risk of developing bacterial gastroenteritis. The following general precautions are recommended: 1 6 3 4 9 Always wash your hands well with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, after using the toilet Always wash your hands well before preparing food, and after handling any raw meat or fish Wash fruit and vegetables in clean water before using them Use different chopping boards for meat and vegetables, and clean them thoroughly with a disinfectant after use Regularly clean kitchen work surfaces with a disinfectant Cook all meat and fish well Store food in clean containers at appropriate temperatures; throw out anything that seems to have spoiled When traveling to other countries, drink only bottled water or water that has been boiled for at least 10 minutes; and only eat food that has been well cooked and fruit that can be peeled. 9 Bacterial gastroenteritis is contagious and can be spread easily. For this reason, it is important for people who have bacterial gastroenteritis to take precautions to avoid passing it on to other people. If you have bacterial gastroenteritis, in addition to the actions above, doing the following can help to prevent the spread of the infection: 1 6 4 9 Clean the toilet and bathroom thoroughly with disinfectant on a daily basis Avoid sharing cutlery, towels, clothing and linen; also wash your items separately in hot water, with bleach if possible Avoid preparing food for other people for at least two days after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up Stay off work or school, if possible, until at least two days after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up Avoid swimming for two weeks after the vomiting or diarrhea has cleared up.",
    "other_names_for_bacterial_gastroenteritis": "Bacterial gastroenteritis is sometimes also known as: Stomach flu Stomach bug Traveler’s diarrhea, sometimes written as travelers’ diarrhea or travellers’ diarrhea Infectious diarrhea Montezuma’s revenge (may be considered inappropriate) Food poisoning or foodborne illness.",
    "bacterial_gastroenteritis_faqs": "Q: Is bacterial gastroenteritis contagious? A: Yes, bacterial gastroenteritis is contagious, which means that it can be spread directly from person to person. However, it is most often spread via contaminated food and water. Practicing good hygiene, such as washing one’s hands with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer after going to the toilet and before eating, can help to reduce the risk of developing bacterial gastroenteritis. 1 2 Q: How long does bacterial gastroenteritis last? A: The duration of a bout of bacterial gastroenteritis is usually a couple of days to a week, though some types of bacteria cause symptoms that last for just a day, and others cause symptoms that may persist for up to two weeks or longer. 14 It is generally recommended that a person stay off work or school until two days after symptoms have cleared. However, because the bacteria may still be present in a person’s stools for several days or weeks after symptoms have disappeared, it is very important to maintain good personal hygiene and wash the hands thoroughly after using the toilet and before touching food. This is especially important for people who work with food, e.g. in restaurants. Regulations differ among countries, but in some cases, a stool test may be required to confirm that the person is no longer infectious. 15 Q: How can I tell if it is bacterial gastroenteritis or viral gastroenteritis? A: In most cases of gastroenteritis, it is not necessary to find out whether the cause of the stomach bug is viral or bacterial, as the treatment is largely the same and is aimed at providing relief from symptoms. However, in some cases, if symptoms are severe or do not clear up, a doctor may recommend tests to identify the cause and prescribe a specific treatment, such as antibiotics. 6 2 16 17 Q: Bacterial gastroenteritis vs. food poisoning – what is the difference? A: Though definitions may vary, food poisoning is a broad term for illness that arises from contaminated food or drink. Food poisoning can be caused by a variety of bugs, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, as well as toxins. If bacteria are the cause of the condition, the term bacterial gastroenteritis may be used. Sometimes the terms bacterial gastroenteritis and bacterial food poisoning are used interchangeably. Though many cases of bacterial gastroenteritis are caused by contaminated food, this is not true of all of them; in some instances, the bacteria may be transmitted directly from live animals, or from one person to another. 18 19 20 Q: Do I need antibiotics for food poisoning? A: Food poisoning can be caused by a number of different organisms, including viruses and bacteria. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses, and in most cases of bacterial food poisoning, antibiotics are not needed or recommended. Antibiotics are typically only recommended where symptoms are severe or persistent, or the person has a weakened immune system, or is maybe at risk of developing complications for other reasons. They may also be recommended for some cases of traveler’s diarrhea, as well as C.diff infections. 2 11 Q: Should I be worried about “traveler’s diarrhea”? A: Traveler’s diarrhea is a name given to episodes of gastroenteritis, most commonly bacterial gastroenteritis, which develop during or shortly after travel abroad.  The main symptom is diarrhea, which is typically watery, though nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain may also occur. Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are relatively mild and can be managed without the need for medical advice. Dehydration is the main risk, so it is important to consume plenty of fluids and get sufficient rest. Medical advice should be sought in any of the following situations: 12 A fever is present The person passes bloody stool There is difficulty replacing fluids because of frequent bouts of diarrhea or vomiting There are signs and symptoms of dehydration Symptoms last for more than 2-3 days Antibiotics have been prescribed, but symptoms have not improved within three days The person is a young child, is elderly or has an underlying medical condition The person is pregnant. Q: Is traveler’s diarrhea contagious? A: Traveler’s diarrhea is often caused by bacteria and can be spread from person to person where good personal hygiene is not maintained. However, it is usually transmitted through contaminated food or beverages. 21 Q: Can you have bacterial gastroenteritis without diarrhea? A: Diarrhea or loose bowels is typically, though not always, the main symptom of a bacterial stomach bug. There are many different possible causes of gastroenteritis, including viruses (see viral gastroenteritis ), and not every type of stomach flu will result in diarrhea in every person. 22 If you think that you might have a case of gastro, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Many other health conditions can cause gastrointestinal symptoms that may be mistaken for gastroenteritis. Q: Can you have bacterial gastroenteritis with diarrhea as the only symptom? A: Symptoms of bacterial gastroenteritis vary in type and severity, and some people may experience diarrhea without other symptoms, such as abdominal pain or nausea."

It is a serious condition and requires urgent medical treatment. Many different bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis. Typical symptoms are headache, neck stiffness, fever, and vomiting. Symptoms can come on very suddenly, and the affected person can become very sick within a few hours.\n\nBacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics, though other treatments might be needed to support the person through the illness. Meningitis can occasionally lead to death, but early recognition and treatment give the best chance of a good recovery. If you become concerned that you or someone you know may have meningitis, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Typical symptoms of bacterial meningitis include: Headache Neck stiffness Nausea Vomiting Fever Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Other symptoms include drowsiness and confusion. Some types of meningitis can cause a deep purple, blotching rash. Symptoms can come on very suddenly, and the affected person can become very sick within a few hours. If meningitis is suspected, it is best to seek medical advice as soon as possible.\n\nIn children , the symptoms of bacterial meningitis may be different from those in adults. The symptoms of meningitis in children may not always be clear. 1 It is important to remember that infants and very young children often cannot tell caregivers how they feel, so vigilance is important. In babies and young children , symptoms may include: 1 2 Fast breathing Difficulty breathing Excessive, high-pitched crying or moaning, or crying that is noticeably different from the baby’s usual cry Irritability Lethargy or less activity than usual Drowsiness, sleepiness, or being difficult to wake up Refusal to eat and/or vomiting Jerky movements and stiffness, or floppiness High fever, above 38 °C / 100.4 °F, or changing body temperature, i.e., being hot and then cold Seizures Bulging fontanelle, the soft spot on top of a baby’s head If seizures occur or if the baby’s fontanelle is bulging, seek emergency medical help immediately. Small babies with a fever may not necessarily appear to be hot and may, in fact, shiver. Their hands or feet may be cold, and their skin may be pale, mottled, or blue. 2 Children younger than one year of age do not usually have a stiff neck. 3 In young children, early symptoms indicating that meningitis is developing can include: 2 Leg pains Cold hands or feet Rash (see below) Blueness, pallor, or duskiness around the lips.\n\nThe classic triad of symptoms of meningitis are a stiff neck, headache and fever, but these are not all present in all cases . However, most people with meningitis tend to have two of the four following symptoms: 1 Fever Headache A stiff neck Altered mental status, for example confusion, disorientation or unusual sleepiness. Other symptoms include: 1 2 4 Pale, blotchy or bluish skin Rash Nausea Vomiting Photophobia or discomfort around bright light Muscle pain or joint pain Abdominal pain or diarrhea Irritability Seizures Cranial nerve problems, such as nonreactive pupils Shock, the symptoms of which include low blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, and low urine output To check whether someone’s pupils are reactive, shine a small light, for example from a penlight, directly into the eye. If the pupil shrinks and then enlarges again when the light is removed, the pupillary reaction is normal. If this does not happen, the pupils may be nonreactive. If seizures occur or the affected person is showing signs of altered consciousness, seek emergency medical help immediately. Seizures affect about three in every ten adults with meningitis. If the person affected has recently been taking antibiotics, some symptoms may be different or absent. People with suppressed or damaged immune systems may also not show clear signs of meningitis. 1 If it is not certain that the ill person has meningitis, but it is suspected, seek medical care immediately. It is better to err on the side of caution. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have bacterial meningitis, you can do a free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.\n\nA rash is one of the most distinctive symptoms of bacterial meningitis in children and adults alike. Although the rash is common, it can be absent. The rash is red or purple in color, and can occur anywhere on the body, including on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The spots may resemble tiny bruises. 2 The rash develops as small spots, which can occur in groups. 5 It is another important feature of the rash associated with bacterial meningitis that it does not go away/fade when pressed. 2",
    "what_causes_bacterial_meningitis": "Newborn children are the population group at the highest risk of meningitis, although this condition can affect people of all ages. Males may be slightly more at risk than females. People with other medical conditions, including a recent ear infection or throat infection , or who have had a recent skull fracture, are at increased risk of meningitis.\n\nMeningitis occurs when bacteria invade the bloodstream,  cross the blood-brain barrier, and infect the meninges, membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord. The meninges are filled with a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. Usually, the blood and brain systems are separate. Healthy CSF is sterile, meaning it is free from bacteria or other microorganisms. The bacteria that infect the meninges in bacterial meningitis can come from anywhere in the body, 1 , and once they are in the CSF, they multiply, releasing toxins. This causes inflammation of the meninges and the brain, which increases intracranial pressure (ICP), i.e., pressure inside the skull. This increase in pressure causes many of the distinctive symptoms of meningitis, including a stiff neck, headache, and sensitivity to light. Because of the blood-brain barrier, the body’s immune system battles to fight the infection, which causes great stress on the body. White blood cells and other elements of the immune system enter the CSF. The flow of blood components into the CSF means that the amount of blood flowing in the body is reduced, which affects the amount of oxygen available to the muscles and organs. The body tries to maintain its oxygen supply to the vital organs by reducing blood flow to the extremities, resulting in cold hands and feet. The spread of blood components into the CSF, along with the bacterial infection, can cause the brain to swell, a condition known as cerebral edema. Intracranial pressure increases, causing complications and, in some cases, death. 1 Bacterial meningitis can result in complications that affect cognitive functioning if not treated in time, and it is often fatal if not treated. Concerned that you or someone you love might have meningitis? Start your free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.\n\nSome medical conditions can increase the vulnerability of certain people to bacterial meningitis. These include some chronic conditions, recent bacterial infections, and some surgical procedures of the skull and head. Chronic conditions which increase the risk of catching bacterial meningitis include: 1 Diabetes mellitus Chronic kidney problems Cystic fibrosis Sickle cell disease Thalassemia major Congenital malformations of the brain membranes, spinal cord or skull Hypoparathyroidism, or an underactive parathyroid gland Having an underactive spleen or no spleen HIV infection or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Cirrhosis of the liver Other factors which increase a person’s risk of developing bacterial meningitis include: Being very young or very old Alcoholism IV drug use An infection elsewhere in the body, such as otitis media , mastoiditis, bacterial sinusitis , bacterial endocarditis , or pneumonia Recent cranial surgery Cranial shunts or stents Head injuries that penetrate the scalp, meningeal membranes, and/or skull Crowding, for example, in a military barracks or student dormitory Exposure to someone with bacterial meningitis Various bacteria can cause meningitis. The ones most often encountered include: 1 Haemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis Pneumococcus, also known as Streptococcus pneumoniae Meningococcus, also known as Neisseria meningitidis Mycobacterium tuberculosis , although this is rare Other bacteria which can cause meningitis include: 1 Escherichia coli Klebsiella Pseudomonas aeruginosa Salmonella Listeria monocytogenes (see FAQs )\n\nMeningococcal meningitis is caused by a bacteria known as Neisseria meningitidis. Rates of meningococcal meningitis are dropping in the developed world, largely due to the availability of a vaccine against Meningococcus C. 4 Meningococcal infection can cause septicemia or meningitis, or both (see FAQs ). Many people carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose and throat, where they are quite harmless. These bacteria have to breach the immune system in order to cause an infection, and they tend to cause only isolated cases or small outbreaks. 2 These bacteria can be passed on by contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing. However, meningococcus is endemic to certain developing countries in Asia and Africa. It is a common cause of meningitis associated with overseas travel. Muslim pilgrims on the Hajj are particularly at risk. 3 Travellers to these regions should ask their physicians about the possibility of getting the meningococcus C vaccine; vaccinations against meningococcus A, W135 and Y may also be useful.\n\nSevere pneumococcal infections are more common in developing countries. 4 Like meningococcus, pneumococcus can cause meningitis and septicemia, but many people carry it harmlessly in their noses and throats, and infections can only happen if the bacteria breach the immune system. 2 Meningitis caused by pneumococcus can be more severe than that caused by meningococcus, and is associated with somewhat higher mortality. 3 However, vaccines against pneumococcal meningitis are available. If you are worried that you or someone you know may have bacterial meningitis, you can do a free symptom assessment with Ada at any time.",
    "bacterial_meningitis_diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination, and tests that confirm the presence of a severe infection in the body. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid in the meninges around the brain and spinal cord, is taken and tested for the specific bacteria causing the infection. When bacterial meningitis is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be started right away. 1\n\nAlso known as a spinal tap, a lumbar puncture is a crucial part of the diagnostic process for bacterial meningitis. A lumbar puncture is done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, which is then sent for laboratory testing. Lumbar punctures are usually quite safe, though they may be a little tender or painful afterwards. A lumbar puncture is done under local anesthetic, and a needle is inserted into a gap between two lumbar vertebrae in the lower back. A needle is used to draw off a small amount of fluid from around the spinal cord. The spinal cord itself is not touched.\n\nThe CSF sample taken during the lumbar puncture will be analysed to confirm the presence of bacteria, determine what kind of bacteria are causing the infection, and determine how far along the infection is. Blood tests may also be carried out to check organ function and dehydration. These results will guide the treatment.",
    "treating_bacterial_meningitis": "Bacterial meningitis is a serious condition and requires urgent medical care. The infection is treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, i.e., through a drip. People with bacterial meningitis are often very sick and may need other supportive treatment, such as fluids to increase blood pressure while the antibiotics work to fight the infection. Most people with suspected bacterial meningitis will also be isolated after being admitted to hospital.\n\nMost cases of bacterial meningitis are treated with intravenous antibiotics administered as soon as possible. Because the treatment often begins before the exact bacteria responsible are identified, the antibiotics used may change. Also, as some of the bacteria that cause bacterial meningitis are becoming drug-resistant, several antibiotics may have to be tried before treatment is successful. Antibiotics commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis include: 1 3 Cefotaxime Vancomycin Ampicillin Ceftriaxone Penicillin Benzylpenicillin\n\nPeople with meningitis will be treated as inpatients in hospital, and most will need to be in intensive care for a short time. They will be monitored for seizures, dehydration, 2 coughing or straining (which can increase intracranial pressure), pain, fever and hypotension (low blood pressure). 1 There is some evidence  that administering corticosteroids reduces inflammation, which decreases the risk of some complications. 3",
    "complications": "Because meningitis involves a severe infection of the brain and the spinal cord, and also affects the body as a whole, complications are common. Even with prompt treatment, almost three in ten survivors of meningitis have neurological complications of some kind, with one in seven experiencing serious long-term problems. 1\n\nThe severity of the bacterial infection in meningitis can cause short-term complications such as: 1 Sepsis Coma Seizures Cerebral edema Pericardial effusion Hemolytic anemia Septic arthritis Peripheral gangrene Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome\n\nSevere bacterial infections, such as bacterial meningitis, can cause a rare complication called Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome, a condition in which the adrenal glands fail due to bleeding. The syndrome causes bleeding throughout the body and, because of the damage to the adrenal glands, adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms include: 6 7 A rash, which begins as small, pink patches or pimple-like swellings, which expand into larger, purple patches Malaise and weakness Dizziness Cough Joint and muscle pain Fever Rigors Nausea and vomiting Headache Low blood pressure Fast heart rate Sepsis\n\nMost cases are caused by severe infection with meningococcal bacteria, Group B streptococcus, Streptococcus aeruginosa, Staphylococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome is a medical emergency and anyone who shows symptoms of the syndrome should receive medical care immediately. Treatment is usually carried out in an intensive care unit (ICU), and is supportive while using antibiotics and glucocorticoids. However, due to the severity of the syndrome, affected people may die of sepsis. 6\n\nIn the long term, some people who have had meningitis, experience some degree of: 2 4 Hearing loss Sight loss or blindness Ataxia, loss of coordinated muscle movements Seizures or epilepsy Learning and motor difficulties Cranial nerve dysfunction, which can affect the facial muscles, smell, sight and taste Hydrocephalus, or fluid buildup in the brain Organ damage, for example, kidney damage In children, damage to the growth plates of the bones leads to impaired growth",
    "what_are_the_bacterial_meningitis_precautions": "Some common causes of bacterial meningitis are preventable by vaccine. Keeping to the recommended vaccination schedule can help prevent some cases of meningitis. Good hygiene, such as washing hands, can also help to avoid some cases of bacterial meningitis.\n\nIn many countries, children are routinely vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae, meningococcus and pneumococcus. It is possible to be vaccinated as an adult.\n\nPeople who have been in contact with someone with bacterial meningitis, especially meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis should be offered a short course of preventative antibiotics. 3 Rifampin or ceftriaxone in prophylactic doses is offered to: 1 Housemates and family members living with the affected person Coworkers Caregivers Classmates or people in the same school dormitory People living in the same student accommodation or military barracks Paramedics who were in contact with the affected person",
    "bacterial_meningitis_faqs": "Q: How is bacterial meningitis related to septicemia? A: Some cases of bacterial meningitis are caused by a bacteria called Neisseiria meningitidis, which is also known as meningococcus. Meningococcus can also cause meningococcal septicemia, a blood infection that can be very serious, 8 especially for young children and babies. 9 Meningococcal meningitis and meningococcal septicemia are both types of meningococcal disease; meningococcal septicemia is also sometimes called meningococcemia. 10 Meningitis and septicemia are both medical emergencies, and if you suspect that you or a loved one has meningitis or septicemia, you should seek medical care as soon as possible. Q: What are the symptoms of septicaemia? A: The symptoms of meningococcal septicemia, like the symptoms of meningitis, can come on suddenly, and the affected person can become very ill within hours. 8 The symptoms of meningococcal septicemia include: 10 4 Fever Fatigue Cold hands and feet Pale, mottled, or blue skin Rapid heartbeat Chills Vomiting and nausea, sometimes with diarrhea Abdominal pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and/or chest pain Low urine output Thirstiness Rapid breathing, labored breathing, or grunting while breathing Low blood pressure A purple rash on the skin that does not fade when pressed Not all affected people will have all of these symptoms. If the rash is present or if the affected person has lowered blood pressure, the infection is serious ,and an ambulance should be called. All cases of septicemia will require urgent medical care, and it is essential that medical care is sought as soon as possible. The chances of a good outcome are improved if the disease is spotted early. Parents of small children or the caregivers of people who are at risk of septicemia should be on the lookout for: 4 5 Fever Vomiting and nausea Lethargy Pain in the legs Cold hands and/or feet Pale, mottled, or bluish skin These are the earliest symptoms; others may appear as the infection continues. It is possible to have meningococcal septicemia and meningococcal meningitis at the same time. For the symptoms of meningococcal septicemia, see above. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have meningococcal meningitis or septicemia, start a free Ada symptom assessment now. Q: What is the difference between viral and bacterial meningitis? A: Viral meningitis is also known as aseptic meningitis . Viral meningitis is a serious medical problem in itself, and anyone who might have it should seek medical help as soon as they can, but it is usually less serious than bacterial meningitis. It is much more common than bacterial meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis in people with healthy immune systems clear up on their own within a week or so, and complications are not common. However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms. Viruses that can cause aseptic meningitis include the flu virus, the common cold virus, the measles virus, HIV , AND the mumps virus, as well as enteroviruses such as the polio virus. 11 Q: What is the treatment for viral meningitis? A: Some people with severe viral meningitis may need to be hospitalized for a short period, but generally, the treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms. It is important to stay well-hydrated, and the pain and fever can be managed with acetaminophen/paracetamol or, in adults, aspirin. However, everyone who presents with the symptoms of meningitis should seek urgent medical care, as it is not possible to tell whether meningitis is caused by bacteria or viruses just by looking at the symptoms. 12 Some kinds of viral meningitis can be prevented by vaccines which prevent the diseases that can lead to viral meningitis. Diseases associated with viral meningitis, which a person can be vaccinated against, include the chickenpox, measles, mumps, and influenza vaccines. Q: Can meningitis be caused by fungi, parasites, or amoebas? A: Yes. Though rarer than viral or bacterial meningitis, fungi, parasites, and amebas can all cause meningitis in some instances. Fungal meningitis is rare in the developed world, but can be caused by Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, or Coccidioides. Most of these fungal organisms are found in soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings. Candida, another fungus that can cause meningitis, is usually found in hospital settings. Fungal meningitis cannot be passed from person to person. 13 Parasitic meningitis can be caused by parasitic nematodes (worms) and roundworms. 14 Most cases are found in people who have traveled to Southeast Asia and eaten contaminated meat or fish, seafood, eggs, snails, or fresh produce washed in contaminated water. However, a roundworm called Baylisascaris procyonis is found in raccoon droppings in North America. 15 Parasitic meningitis is quite rare. Amebic meningitis is very rare, but very serious. It is caused by a water-dwelling ameba called Naegleria fowleri, which is found in unchlorinated water, i.e., warm freshwater bodies such as lakes and swimming holes, bodies of water contaminated by warm industrial discharges, poorly-maintained swimming pools, untreated drinking water, or dirty water heaters. The organism requires warm conditions to survive, and cannot survive in saltwater. 16 Q: Does Haemophilus influenzae cause the flu? A: No. Despite the name, viruses that cause influenza are not related to Haemophilus influenzae, which is a bacterium. 17 Influenza is a viral disease caused by a type of orthomyxovirus. Haemophilus influenzae was named by its discoverer during an influenza epidemic in the late 1800s; at that time, it was not known that viruses caused influenza, and the disease was thought to be caused by bacteria. Q: Who is at risk from Listeria monocytogenes infection? A: Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that is often found as a food contaminant, and most cases of infection, also known as listeriosis, are the result of consuming contaminated food. It does not often cause meningitis, but as listeria-related meningitis has a high mortality, it is important to be vigilant about outbreaks of listeria. People at increased risk of developing meningitis after a listeria infection include: Pregnant women Infants and young children People over 60 years of age Alcoholics Immunosuppressed individuals People with diabetes People with chronic kidney or liver disease. Q: What is a brain herniation? A: A brain herniation occurs when high pressure or a change in pressure causes the brain, blood vessels within the brain, or cerebrospinal fluid to move out of their usual position. The brain tissue may be pressed out through an injury in the skull or one of the skull’s natural internal openings, for example, the foramen magnum, the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord passes from the brain into the spine. Brain herniation is a serious medical condition, and treatment is essential. Neurological damage or death may result from a brain herniation. Q: How is the risk of brain herniation minimized during the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis? A: The most common method of keeping the risk of brain herniation to a minimum is to give the affected person a CT scan before the lumbar puncture is carried out. CT scans are not generally considered to be a standard requirement in the diagnosis of meningitis, but they are an important precaution to prevent brain herniation following a lumbar puncture. People who have the following conditions may need to have a CT scan before a lumbar puncture can be carried out: 1 3 A history of stroke or other central nervous system problems Seizures within the previous seven days Altered or reduced consciousness A very severe headache A possible neurological deficit, such as nonreactive pupils or gaze palsy, a condition that affects the ability of the eyes to move in the same direction simultaneously."

    "what_is_bacterial_prostatitis": "Bacterial prostatitis is a condition in which a bacterial infection develops in the prostate gland. The prostate is a gland that sits under the bladder, and forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder). Older men with an enlarged prostate are commonly affected by bacterial prostatitis. Typical symptoms are fever, chills, burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Treatment includes antibiotics, pain killers and, sometimes, a urinary catheter if emptying the bladder becomes difficult. With antibiotic treatment, many people recover well.",
    "risks": "The prostate is a gland that sits under the bladder, and forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine away from the bladder). Bacterial infections can form in the prostate due to bladder infections or some sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Older men who already have an enlarged prostate gland are most commonly affected but men of every age can get bacterial prostatitis. Men who have diabetes, a weak immune system, an indwelling urinary catheter, or who self-catheterize (use a tube to empty the bladder of urine) are at higher risk of developing bacterial prostatitis.",
    "symptoms": "Common symptoms of bacterial prostatitis are fever, chills, a burning sensation while urinating, difficulty to start urination, and pain around the anus. Other symptoms are foul-smelling urine, weak urine flow, painful ejaculation and blood in the urine.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, examination of the prostate, and urine tests. Examination of the prostate involves a doctor gently putting a finger into the anus and feeling the prostate through the rectum (from behind the prostate). This can be a little painful for people with prostatitis. The urine is tested for bacteria, and this is sometimes requires prostatic massage, a procedure in which a doctor massages the prostate before the urine sample is made.",
    "treatment": "Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics. These are usually taken for 2-4 weeks. If the infection becomes persistent, longer courses of antibiotics or antibiotics through a drip (intravenous) may be needed. Pain can be managed with simple pain-relieving medication (paracetamol or ibuprofen). A urinary catheter (a tube) might be needed in case urination is difficult and very painful.",

    "condition": "Bacterial Sinusitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-sinusitis/",
    "what_is_bacterial_sinusitis": "Bacterial sinusitis is a bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses, the hollow spaces in the bones of the face around the nose. Sinusitis is a very common problem, affecting approximately one in every eight American adults annually. Almost 30 million people seek medical help for sinusitis in the USA every year. 1 Bacterial sinusitis involves inflammation of the mucous membrane lining of the sinuses, and is caused by a bacterial infection. There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses which are located below, above, between and behind the eye sockets – the maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, ethmoid sinuses and sphenoidal sinuses. The maxillary sinuses are the largest of these, and are most often affected by sinusitis. However, sinusitis can affect any or all of the paranasal sinuses. Because sinusitis often occurs along with rhinitis, inflammation of the mucous membrane in the nose, it is sometimes known as rhinosinusitis. 2\n\nBacterial sinusitis often follows a viral infection, such as a cold or the flu . Viral infections can cause the mucosal lining of the sinuses to swell. 3 In healthy sinuses, mucus drains into the nasal cavity via small holes, known as ostia. Swelling of the mucus membranes in the nose or sinus cavities can block these holes, preventing mucus from draining out of the sinuses. Bacteria colonize the undrained mucus, which can lead to bacterial sinusitis. 2 Bacterial sinusitis may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and antibiotics as needed. Most cases of bacterial sinusitis resolve within two weeks, and have no further symptoms.",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Viral sinusitis is the most common type of sinusitis . It is usually caused by the same viruses that cause the common cold and typically lasts for between 7 and 10 days. 4 If the condition lasts longer than 10 days, or there is a worsening of symptoms after 5 to 7 days, the sinusitis is more likely caused by bacteria than a virus. 3\n\nBacterial sinusitis can be grouped into the following subtypes based on the d uration of symptoms : 2 4 5 Acute, which lasts for less than four weeks Subacute, lasting for between four and 12 weeks Chronic, lasting for more than 12 weeks Recurrent acute, occurring four or more times a year, for more than 7 days, with symptoms resolving completely in between bouts\n\nSymptoms of bacterial sinusitis include: 1 2 4 6 Pressure or pain around the nose, in the forehead, in the cheeks or around the eyes. The pain often gets worse if the affected person bends forward. Discolored, thick nasal discharge Decreased sense of smell and ability to taste Stuffy nose Bad breath In some cases, affected people may also experience: Coughing or sore throat Post-nasal drip (mucus dripping down the back of the throat) Ear pain or a feeling of fullness in the ears Fever Fatigue Facial pain Painful teeth Painful chewing 2\n\nIn children, the symptoms of sinusitis may differ from those in adults. Children may experience: 4 6 Irritability Ear discomfort Lethargy Snoring Mouth breathing Difficulty feeding Nasal speech 4",
    "causes": "The condition is caused by bacteria that live in the nose , throat and, sometimes, the mouth. Types of bacteria which commonly cause bacterial sinusitis include: 1 2 5 Streptococcus pneumoniae Hemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus Moraxella catarrhalis As detailed above, bacterial sinusitis often follows a cold or flu infection. Other conditions that can increase a person’s risk of bacterial sinusitis include: 1 4 6 Allergies Asthma Smoking Nasal obstruction, for example due to nasal polyps or a deviated nasal septum (the wall between the nasal cavities) Congenital disease such as cystic fibrosis Conditions which cause a weakened immune system, such as HIV infection , leukemia or immunosuppressive therapy following an organ transplant Diabetes Hormonal changes, for example those that occur during pregnancy Irritating inhalants, such as cocaine Fungal infections Scar tissue in sinus areas, for example from nasogastric tubes or mechanical ventilation Facial fractures Tooth or mouth infections such as a dental abscess (infection may spread due to the close proximity of the maxillary sinuses to the upper jaw) In general, women are slightly more likely than men to get bacterial sinusitis.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination . In severe cases or cases that do not respond to treatment, a nasal endoscopy may be done to aid diagnosis and treatment.\n\nAn endoscope is a small, flexible tool equipped with a camera, which allows the doctor a detailed view of the inside of the nose and sinuses. The endoscopic examination is usually done in the doctor’s office. A nasal decongestant will be administered, and the nose will be numbed by an anesthetic spray. If the endoscopic exam is not helpful or if the doctor wants to carry out further examination, a ct scan may be ordered. A CT scan can be helpful in assessing the sinuses and confirming the diagnosis in complicated cases.",
    "treatment": "Most cases of bacterial sinusitis will get better without antibiotics, usually within 14 days. 4 Because of this, and because bacterial sinusitis is often caused by bacteria that are to some degree resistant to antibiotics, most doctors prefer that affected people initially try to manage the condition using home remedies and over-the-counter medications. Antibiotics are usually only prescribed for people who have severe or ongoing symptoms, or whose infection may be complicated by various other medical factors. Viral sinusitis does not respond to antibiotic treatment. Although most cases of bacterial sinusitis clear up without the help of  a doctor, affected people should seek medical assistance if: 2 They have a fever of 101.4 F / 38 C or higher They have a bad headache that is not relieved by basic painkillers such as paracetamol They have any signs of eye involvement (visual changes, pain moving the eyes, or any swelling or redness around the eye) They have had symptoms for more than 10 days Their symptoms are worsening They have had antibiotic treatment, but the symptoms persist\n\nIn many cases, home remedies may be sufficient. Some people find breathing humid air or steam, such as in a warm shower, helps to relieve symptoms. Also, holding a warm pad over the painful area helps to relieve discomfort. Nasal irrigation with saline solution is helpful in reducing congestion in the nose. It is also very important to stay well-hydrated, so affected people should be sure to drink enough fluids.\n\nPainkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can help reduce the nose and face pain . Decongestant and anti-inflammatory sprays or tablets are also often helpful in relieving symptoms. Decongestants commonly used are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used to suppress the inflammation. 6 5\n\nAntibiotic treatment is usually only needed if the infection does not improve within 7-10 days, the person has another medical condition which may affect recovery, or if: 5 6 Severe pain is present Swelling at the front of the head, cheeks or around the eyes occurs Nasal discharge contains blood High fever is present These are indications that the bacterial infection is severe. Antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed for about 10 days, but shorter courses may be as effective, depending on the bacteria involved. The choice of which antibiotic to use will be based on which bacteria the treating physician thinks are likely to be involved in the infection. 1\n\nSurgery is not usually needed for acute bacterial sinusitis. It is only necessary in some cases of chronic sinusitis that do not respond to other forms of treatment. Endoscopic treatment, where a small camera-equipped probe is used to guide and perform the procedure, is one option. In this surgery, the endoscope is used to widen the natural drainage pathways in the sinuses and nose, which improves mucus drainage and cuts down on congestion and the chance of infection. 3 Rarely, acute bacterial sinusitis may cause an abscess to form near the eye or the brain. In these cases, surgical treatment will be needed to drain the abscess. 1 6",
    "prevention": "Taking care to prevent the spread of colds or the flu in the home and community can help prevent some cases of bacterial sinusitis. Seeing a dentist regularly may help to prevent tooth infections, a possible cause of bacterial sinusitis.",
    "faqs": "Q: Can bacterial sinusitis cause a sore throat ? A: Bacterial sinusitis may be accompanied by postnasal drip, an uncomfortable condition where excess mucus can irritate the  throat. Additionally, if bacterial sinusitis was preceded by a viral upper respiratory illness, a sore throat may have been a feature of this. Q: Where are the paranasal sinuses? A: There are four pairs of paranasal sinuses: the maxillary, frontal, ethmoid and sphenoidal. The maxillary sinuses are located below the eyes, and the frontal sinuses are above the eyes. Both of these are near the front of the head, near the inner corners of the eyes. The ethmoid sinuses are located in the ethmoid bone, which separates the brain from the nasal cavity; the sinuses themselves are between the eyes. The sphenoid sinuses are behind the eyes. The maxillary sinuses are most commonly affected by sinusitis."

    "condition": "Bacterial Vaginosis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/bacterial-vaginosis/",
    "what_is_bacterial_vaginosis": "Bacterial vaginosis, also called bacterial vaginitis or BV, is an infection of the vagina caused by an imbalance of various types of natural vaginal bacteria. It is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and is estimated to affect as many as one in three women at some point in their lives. 1 BV can be a significant source of embarrassment and distress for affected women, but is relatively simple to treat using antibiotics. Long-term problems are rare as a result of bacterial vaginosis, but it can increase the risk of developing various sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. 2",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_symptoms": "Roughly 50 to 75 percent of women with bacterial vaginosis experience no symptoms. Among those who do, the most common symptom is milky, off-white or grey vaginal discharge, which is often described as having a fishy odour. The discharge tends to be heavier after sexual intercourse or a period. Symptoms common to other vaginal disorders, such as pain during sex or when urinating, redness and swelling, are not typical of BV. Some women, however, may experience vaginal itching. 2 The Ada app can help you to check your symptoms. Download the app now for a free symptom assessment or find out more here.",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_causes": "Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the distribution of vaginal bacteria becomes unbalanced. Normally, the vagina contains a mixture of bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria and lactobacilli. As a result of BV, anaerobic bacteria multiply and the amount of lactobacilli is reduced. 1 2 The precise reason as to why this happens is not known, though it is thought to involve a change in the acidity of the vagina. ref1\n\nA common misconception about bacterial vaginosis is that it is made more likely by poor vaginal hygiene: this is not true. Conversely, use of certain soaps may in some cases play a role. Other factors that may contribute to the development of bacterial vaginosis include: 1 Sexual activity Frequently changing sexual partners A history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Smoking Use of an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) Being of Afro-Caribbean descent Having heavy periods Use of bubble baths Hormonal changes, including puberty, pregnancy and menopause Use of sex toys and lubricants Use of antibiotics These factors make BV more likely; they do not guarantee that a person will develop the condition. Women who have never had sex, however, rarely develop BV. 3",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_diagnosis": "Bacterial vaginosis is typically diagnosed following an examination of the symptoms and laboratory testing. The characteristic discharge of BV will usually indicate the presence of the condition, with testing necessary to confirm that it is not the result of another, similar condition, such as thrush or chlamydia.",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_treatment": "In some cases, bacterial vaginosis will resolve without specific treatment. 3 Seeking professional medical treatment, however, is recommended. This will typically involve a short-course of antibiotics, which may be taken orally or applied directly to the vagina as a gel or cream. When taking antibiotics, always be sure to take the whole course, even if the problem clears up before this time. The male sexual partner(s) of women with BV do not need to receive treatment. An estimated 30 percent of women experience a relapse of symptoms within 3 months of receiving treatment, and roughly 50 percent of women will relapse within 12 months. 2 A longer course of antibiotics will usually be required to treat a recurrent infection.",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_complications": "Complications associated with untreated bacterial vaginosis include: 1 4 Infection of the womb following a surgical procedure, such as a vaginal hysterectomy Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) The condition also slightly increases a woman’s likelihood of developing HIV after having sexual intercourse with a person who is already infected. Women with BV and HIV are also more likely to transmit HIV to another person. Read more about HIV home test here >>",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_during_pregnancy": "Untreated bacterial vaginosis can slightly increase the risk of several complications during pregnancy. These include: Premature labor Miscarriage Premature birth Low birth weight Postpartum endometritis, an infection of the womb following childbirth Women displaying symptoms of BV during pregnancy should seek treatment promptly.",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_prevention": "There is no guaranteed way to prevent bacterial vaginosis. Certain actions and behaviors, however, are thought to help. These include: 1 Avoiding the use of perfumed bubble baths, shampoos, soaps, oils, etc. Avoiding pushing water into the vagina (douching) when bathing Avoiding the use of strong or scented detergents to wash underwear Avoiding washing the vagina too often; once daily is usually enough Using a condom during sexual intercourse Using water-based lubricants during sexual intercourse, if lubricants are required Cleaning sex toys thoroughly before use Taking showers rather than baths The birth control pill may also help to prevent the onset of BV. 2",
    "bacterial_vaginosis_faqs": "Q: Is bacterial vaginosis sexually transmitted? A: Bacterial vaginosis has not traditionally been thought of as being sexually transmitted. This is because, although BV is most common among sexually active women, it can affect women who don’t have or never had sex. 1 Moreover, it cannot be passed from a man to a woman, or vice versa. However, studies show that the condition can be passed from one woman to another through sexual intercourse. 5 It is recommended, therefore, that female partners of women with BV be tested for the condition. Q: Can men get bacterial vaginosis? A: No, men cannot contract bacterial vaginosis. The condition is exclusive to the vagina. Q: Should my partner receive treatment for bacterial vaginosis? A: Male sexual partners of a person with BV do not need to receive treatment. Female sexual partners, however, are advised to seek testing and, if appropriate, treatment, for the condition.",

    "condition": "Benign Mole",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/benign-mole/",
    "what_is_a_benign_mole": "Most moles are benign or harmless. Moles are types of skin growths or lesions, commonly referred to as a nevus (plural: nevi). Nevus is a generalised medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion which sits on the skin or mucosa. They can take many different forms, including freckles, moles, skin tags and seborrheic keratoses. 1 Typically, moles are pink, brown or tan in color with a distinct border. Moles usually develop within the thick layer of living tissue below the epidermis (outer layer of skin), which contains blood capillaries, nerve endings, sweat glands, hair follicles, and other structures. Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster, forming a lesion, instead of spreading out across the skin. 2 Some moles develop from cells are called melanocytes, which make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. They can also develop from other cells, including nevus cells. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works .",
    "types": "The most common types of benign mole include: 3 Compound melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised above the skin, light brown and sometimes hairy. Dermal melanocytic nevi, which are usually raised, pale and sometimes hairy. Junctional melanocytic nevi, which are usually brown, round and flat.\n\nA seborrheic keratosis is a kind of skin growth or lesion which usually appears as a brown, black or light tan blemish on the face, chest, shoulders or back. They are usually melanocytic, i.e. melanin-containing, or pigmented. Seborrheic keratoses are common, and can be scaly, waxy and slightly raised above the skin (elevated). Although these growths are not themselves harmful, they can be difficult to distinguish from malignant melanoma, one of the most serious types of skin cancer, so it is advisable to have them checked to ensure that they are not, in fact, melanomas. 3\n\nIf a keratosis becomes actinic, i.e. red, scaly and swollen, this could indicate that it is precancerous. Actinic seborrheic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, usually occur as a result of years of sun exposure. 4 Any suspected actinic keratosis should be checked and removed by a doctor, because, although these lesions are not always malignant, they may develop into melanoma skin cancer if left untreated.\n\nAtypical moles are also known as dysplastic nevi, and the term describes unusual-looking moles. Atypical moles may be mistaken for melanoma , but are not necessarily cancerous or precancerous. However, even though an individual atypical mole may be benign, people who have dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of developing melanoma compared to those who do not. Melanoma can develop in a mole or elsewhere on the body. Common types of dysplastic nevi include: 5 Blue nevus, which is dark blue in color and can be flat or raised. Dysplastic or atypical nevus, which is also known as “Clark nevi,” this is an unusual looking, slightly larger size of mole with an irregular border. Halo nevus, which is urrounded by a white ring where the skin has lost its color.",
    "causes": "Most moles are made of cells called melanocytes which make a pigment called melanin. Melanin has two principal functions: it helps to protect the body from ultraviolet light (UV radiation) from the sun and gives skin and hair its natural color. People with darker complexions have more of these cells, and are more likely to develop new moles after exposure to sunlight. 2 Moles can occur anywhere on the body. They can be present at birth (congenital), but it is possible for them to develop throughout one’s lifetime (acquired). People can be born with moles, or develop new ones of any size and color throughout their lifetime, at any age. In general, however, darker skin types usually have darker moles.",
    "changes_in_benign_moles": "Environmental factors such as exposure to sunlight, and hormonal changes such as going through puberty or pregnancy can cause moles to darken or develop. Therefore, the appearance of moles can change over time. They can change in number and appearance and can also fade away. It is important to familiarise oneself with the lesions on one’s body so as to establish their size, shape and type(s) are normal, as this may be different for every person. This will make it easier to spot atypical lesions or changes to lesions, which could indicate melanoma. Changes in moles may require a visit to a doctor to determine if the mole is exhibiting dysplasia, i.e. becoming dysplastic. When a lesion becomes dysplastic, this is a sign that it contains abnormal cells or may be undergoing abnormal development. A mole becoming dysplastic may indicate the development of melanomas or carcinomas (cancerous cells).",
    "identifying_cancerous_moles": "Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Melanomas develop from melanin-containing cells, called melanocytes. People with fair skin, red or blond hair or who spend a lot of time in strong sunlight are at higher risk of developing melanoma. It is important to avoid prolonged sun or other UV radiation exposure to reduce the risk of developing dysplastic or cancerous moles. Good to know: The most common types of non-melanoma skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The typical warning sign of non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma is a growth or sore that doesn’t heal, which should be checked by a doctor.\n\nNevi with three or more different shades of brown or black are particularly likely to be dysplastic, indicative of melanoma or carcinoma. The alphabetic mnemonic (ABCDE) 5 is a useful way to remember the important indicators that an atypical nevus could be cancerous: Asymmetry. Changing shape, in particular if lesions develop an irregular edge. Border. The border or edges of the nevus become ragged, blurred, or irregular. Color. Getting darker, becoming patchy or multi shaded; its color may have shades of tan, brown, black, blue, white, or red. Diameter. The nevus may get bigger; enlargement is especially concerning if its diameter becomes larger than the eraser of a pencil. Elevation/Evolution. The nevus may appear elevated, or raised from the skin, and may look inflamed, bleed or become crusty. If a nevus suddenly begins to display any of these signs, it is important to have it examined by a dermatologist; a doctor who specialises in conditions that affect the skin. It is also vital to have nevi checked if they bleed, ooze, itch, appear scaly, or become tender or painful.",
    "treatment": "If a dermatologist believes a melanocytic nevus needs to be evaluated further to find out whether it is cancerous, they will conduct a biopsy. This involves shaving or cutting it out so that it can be examined under the microscope. If an atypical nevus is found to contain cancerous melanocytes, the dermatologist will remove the entire mole or scar from the biopsy site by cutting out the entire area, as well as a rim of normal skin around it. They will then suture the wound, i.e. stitch the wound to close it. This treatment is carried out to ensure that any melanoma-containing cells are removed in their entirety, preventing melanoma from spreading elsewhere in the body.\n\nEven though benign moles do not pose health risks such as melanomas, many people opt to have them removed. Most people who seek to have nevi removed do so for cosmetic reasons, for instance, if one is embarrassed about how a particular mole or moles look, or practical reasons such as if they snag on clothing or impede shaving. Scarring is a possible consequence of removing a mole. With scarring in mind, its location and the likely aesthetic development of the scar should be considered before removal, especially in cases where the procedure has been sought for cosmetic reasons. Common methods of removing nevi include: 6 Burning moles off, with an electric current which passes through a wire that becomes hot and is used to burn off the upper layers of the skin. The heat helps prevent bleeding. More than one treatment may be needed to remove a nevus. Alternatively, the nevus can be cut off the skin. Some nevi may have subcutaneous cells, which reside underneath the skin, so the doctor might need to make a deeper cut to remove the entire mole to prevent it from growing back. The cut may require stitches. Nevi can also be frozen off with liquid nitrogen. The dermatologist will swab or spray a small amount of super-cold liquid nitrogen on the mole or skin tag. After it has been frozen off, there might be a blister at the site where it was, but this usually heals on its own.",
    "prevention": "By taking appropriate measures to avoid sun damage, a person can: Prevent new nevi from developing Prevent existing melanocytic nevi from developing melanoma skin cancer When spending time in direct sunlight, always: Wear sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF), such as SPF 50 Use sun-protective clothing, such as wide-brimmed hats, sleeves and long pants Seek shade regularly Stay out of the sunlight between peak hours, (around 10am to 4pm) Check the body several times per year, particularly after periods of sun exposure, for any new atypical moles or atypical changes to existing moles, which could indicate melanoma.",
    "benign_mole_faqs": "Q: Can a benign mole grow back after removal? A: If a mole has been removed by cutting it off so that it is level with the skin, some cells may remain below the skin. These can act as a “seed” and cause it to regrow. It is not possible to predict whether it will grow back. The chances of this are greatly reduced if care is taken to remove the subcutaneous cells during the initial procedure. Q: Can a benign mole become cancerous? A: Melanomas can develop anywhere in the surface of the skin, including sites occupied by benign moles or within the melanocytic tissue of the mole itself. For this reason, it is important to consult a physician if a mole undergoes any changes, as these may be signs that it has become cancerous. Q: Can a benign mole change color? A: Yes. Most commonly, moles change color over time by getting darker after exposure to sunlight. This is not necessarily a cause for concern, but could indicate the presence of melanoma, so it is advisable to consult a doctor. You can also use the free Ada app to check your symptoms."

    "what_is_benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common condition of the inner ear. This condition causes short episodes of dizziness (vertigo) associated with certain head movements. These episodes are caused by particles (crystals) irritating the semicircular canals, the part of the inner ear which regulates balance and equilibrium. Besides dizziness, people with BPPV feel nauseous and may vomit during these attacks. BPPV tends to get better over weeks or months, but may reoccur.",
    "risks": "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can occur at any age, however older people are more commonly affected than children and younger adults. The cause of BPPV is not well understood, however it is thought to be due to a problem in the inner ear caused by particles (crystals) irritating the semicircular canals, the part of the inner ear which regulates balance and equilibrium. In rare cases, head injury can lead to BPPV.",
    "symptoms": "Recurrent, short attacks of dizziness are the main symptom of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. The dizziness associated with vertigo often feels like the world is spinning, rather than a feeling of lightheadedness. The dizziness may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and a loss of balance. The attacks often occur after changing position of the head, such as suddenly turning the head, or moving from lying to sitting.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by a doctor with the help of a physical examination. The diagnosis can be confirmed with specific tests.",
    "treatment": "This form of dizziness can be treated with certain repositioning maneuvers (Epley maneuvers or Brandt-Daroff exercises). During these series of controlled exercises, symptoms may get worse. After being instructed by the doctor in how to do them, people can do some of these exercises at home. Normally BPPV can be treated well in this manner. Medication is not used to treat BPPV, though might be helpful in managing nausea associated with the dizziness. In severe persistent cases surgery may be an option.",
    "prevention": "People with BPPV may need to avoid certain activities or movements which bring on an episode of dizziness, as the dizziness may make these activities unsafe.",

    "condition": "Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/",
    "what_is_benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland (a gland surrounding the neck of the bladder in men). The condition is sometimes also called benign enlargement of the prostate (BEP), in cases where the enlarged prostate reaches or advances beyond a certain size of around 30 cubic cm. The condition involves the development of nodules (small swellings) in a zone of the prostate called the transitional zone. These nodules impair the functioning of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. 1 This impairment often creates various difficulties when urinating. BPH is common in older men and is, in most cases, a non-serious condition. There is no link to prostate cancer , as the cancer grows in a different zone (peripheral zone) of the prostate. A number of treatment options are available for BPH, and it can usually be managed successfully. 2",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptoms of BPH are related to urination. They include: 3 The need to urinate frequently, including at night Strong urges to urinate that appear suddenly and may lead to urinary leakage A weak or interrupted urine stream Urinary dribbling, which is where urine slowly leaks out after urination, due to incomplete emptying of the bladder The sensation that the bladder is never truly empty, also known as incomplete voiding Pain while urinating Red-tinted urine due to presence of small amounts of red blood cells in the urine The symptoms of BPH can vary in severity. Some men will experience extremely mild symptoms that require no treatment. In rarer cases, others, typically those with a full blockage of the urethra, will find it impossible or extremely difficult to urinate. Worried you may have this condition? Start a symptom assessment on the Ada app .",
    "causes": "The exact cause of BPH is unknown, but it is thought mainly to be linked to hormonal changes. Many of these changes naturally affect older men, e.g., declining testosterone levels , which lead to a greater (relative) level of estrogen in the bloodstream. 1 Some experts believe that a family history of prostate irregularities puts some men at greater risk of developing BPH. Certain genetic factors also seem to play a role in the development of BPH. 3",
    "diagnosing_benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": "Diagnosing BPH will typically begin with the doctor taking a medical history, including questions to find out if the affected person has a family history of prostate problems, followed by a full medical examination. The examination will include a digital rectal examination (internal examination of the rectum), through which the doctor will be able to estimate the following about the prostrate: The size The shape The health The rectal examination will also be used to check for the presence of prostate cancer , which, while unconnected to BPH, can be experienced simultaneously with the condition. Other exams and tests may include: 3 Urinalysis: Testing a sample of urine to check for a bladder infection which may be causing the symptoms. Blood tests: To check the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein produced by the prostate that may increase in volume in men with BPH and prostate cancer. In some cases, blood tests may be carried out to check kidney function, as the kidneys can sometimes be affected, e.g., in cases of severe urinary obstruction. Uroflowmetry: To check the rate of urine flow during urination. The normal maximal urinary flow rate, the highest speed at which urine is released from the body during the test, is more than 15 milliliters per second. Maximal flow rates of less than 15 milliliters per second indicate an obstruction at the bladder outlet. Maximal flow rates of less than 10 ml per second (due to BPH) indicate the need for surgery. 1 Abdominal ultrasound: This imaging technique may be used to detect factors such as increased total prostate volume, an elevated post-void residual urine volume (a higher than usual amount of urine, e.g. 100 ml, left in the body after urination), thickening of the bladder wall and hydronephrosis (swelling of a kidney due to a build up of urine). 1 Transrectal ultrasound: This imaging technique requires insertion of an ultrasound probe into the rectum of the affected individual. It is carried out only if prostate cancer is suspected, for example, in cases of abnormal digital rectal exam results, or elevated serum PSA.",
    "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_treatment": "A variety of treatment options for BPH exist, including: Medication Minimally invasive therapy and surgery Surgery The treatment route chosen will depend on: 4 The severity of the condition Age General health The size of the prostate\n\nIn people affected by mildly symptomatic BPH, observation of the condition over time, accompanied by some behavioural changes may be sufficient. These behavioural changes may also be employed as a supplementary therapy for people undergoing medical treatment for BPH. Helpful behavioural changes include: Restricting fluid intake before bedtime and before leaving the house Choosing non-caffeinated and non-alcoholic beverages Ensuring the bladder is completely empty by passing urine in the sitting position and double voiding (emptying the bladder twice to ensure complete urination)\n\nMedication is the most common method of treating BPH. Options include: Alpha blockers: These drugs relax bladder and urethra muscles, easing urination. They are generally more effective in men with smaller prostates and tend to work rapidly. Side-effects may include dizziness and retrograde ejaculation, a harmless condition in which semen is sent to the bladder instead of being released from the penis. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: These drugs work by reducing the size of the prostate. They may take roughly six months to become effective and may also cause retrograde ejaculation. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors: e.g. Tadalafil. Although this drug is more typically prescribed to treat erectile dysfunction, it has also shown success in treating symptoms of BPH. It is generally only prescribed to those experiencing BPH and erectile dysfunction simultaneously. In some cases, the doctor may prescribe a combination of drugs.\n\nFor those experiencing moderate to severe BPH, or in cases where medication has proven to be unsuccessful, a range of minimally invasive surgical therapies are available. These include: Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP): Incisions are made in the prostate by passing a lighted scope (tubular viewing instrument) up the urethra, allowing urine to pass more easily through the urethra. Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT): An electrode is passed into the prostate and microwaves are emitted in order to shrink the prostate. This therapy can ease urine flow. 5 6 Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA): Radio waves are passed through needles which have been inserted into the prostate, heating and reducing excess tissue. Laser therapy: A laser is used to destroy excess prostate tissue, quickly relieving the symptoms of BPH. Interventions such as the Urolift ® system, 7 a non-surgical proprietary device that uses tiny implants to lift the prostate away from the urethra and thereby relieve BPH symptoms that result from pressure on the urethra.\n\nThose with severe symptoms or those for whom other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful may require surgery to treat BPH. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): By passing a lighted scope up the urethra, a surgeon removes the majority of the prostate. This usually relieves the symptoms of BPH, however, a catheter may be required until the operation site has fully healed. Open prostatectomy: This is an inpatient procedure in which an incision is made in the abdomen or perineal area, allowing a surgeon access to the prostate to remove excess tissue. It is common for those with a very large prostate or other complicating factors that rule out other treatment options.",
    "preventing_benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": "The two main causes of BPH, aging and genetics, cannot be avoided, meaning the condition is difficult to prevent. However, leading a healthy lifestyle may delay the onset of the condition or help manage its symptoms. Lifestyle choices that may help include: 8 Maintaining a healthy diet: Fruits and vegetables are high in antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals, which are all substances that may help fight inflammation and reduce the risk of an enlarged prostate . Avoiding fatty, sugary and additive-heavy foods may also help with this. Maintaining a healthy weight: Some studies have drawn a link between being overweight and BPH. Regular exercise can help with this. Managing stress: Some studies have suggested that hormonal changes associated with stress may contribute to the onset of BPH. Do not wait to urinate: Delaying urination may worsen the symptoms of BPH and can, in some cases, lead to a urinary tract infection . Although these lifestyle factors may help delay or manage BPH, even very healthy men can develop BHP, and these preventative measures offer no guarantee against this condition.",
    "possible_complications_and_risk_factors": "Although BPH is usually a non-serious condition that can be managed effectively, in rare cases complications can arise. These include: 9 Urinary tract infection (UTI): Those unable to fully empty their bladder as a result of BPH are at risk of infection. Frequent infection may necessitate the surgical removal of part of the prostate. Urinary retention: An inability to urinate may call for the insertion of a catheter to drain the urine from the bladder. Surgery may also be necessary. Bladder stones: These can lead to infection, irritation, blood in the urine and an inability to properly urinate. Bladder stones can be surgically removed. Bladder damage: BPH, especially when experienced for a prolonged period, can weaken the bladder significantly. Kidney damage: Built-up pressure from urinary retention can damage the kidneys and allow infections to spread to the kidneys. Retrograde ejaculation: Almost all of the surgical procedures listed above can lead to retrograde ejaculation into the bladder. This is because the bladder sphincter, the muscle that usually keeps semen out of the bladder, can be compromised during surgery. If the shape or function of the bladder sphincter is altered during surgery, it may lose its ability to create a complete seal. BPH does not increase, or decrease, the risk of prostate cancer. The peripheral zone (in which prostate cancer can develop) is left intact during the TURP procedure. People who have been treated for BPH are therefore at the same risk of developing prostate cancer as the general male population, so normal prostate cancer screening protocol should be followed. 1",
    "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_faqs": "Q: Is BPH linked to erectile dysfunction? A: BPH and erectile dysfunction (ED) are separate problems. However, certain medications used to treat BPH may lead to ED, while, conversely, certain medications used to treat ED can help with BPH. A doctor can help to outline the right treatment plan for an individual. 10 Q: Are there any natural treatment methods for BPH? A: A number of natural products are thought by some to help treat BPH. These include: 11 Saw palmetto: A herbal remedy that has historically been used to treat urinary problems. Beta-sitosterol: A mixture of plant extracts containing sitosterol, a cholesterol-like substance thought to help with the symptoms of BPH. Pygeum: The bark from the African plum tree which has historically been used to treat urinary problems. Rye grass pollen extract: An extract made from three types of grass pollen that is thought to help relieve the symptoms of BPH. It is important to note that such natural treatments are not guaranteed to help prevent BPH or relieve its symptoms, nor should they be seen as an alternative to normal treatment methods. A doctor should always be consulted before using natural treatment methods."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/bipolar-affective-disorder/",
    "what_is_bipolar_disorder": "Bipolar disorder, also known as bipolar affective disorder and, less commonly, as manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes dramatic changes in mood that, in turn, affect people’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It is characterized by serious mood swings between depression and mania that last several weeks or months. These mood swings are more extreme than those experienced by most people. 1 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), bipolar disorder currently affects 60 million people around the world. 2 Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally. It is most common for bipolar disorder symptoms to begin during someone’s late teenage or early adult years, but children and older adults can also develop bipolar disorder. There is no known cure for bipolar disorder. People with the condition are likely to experience recurrences throughout their life which, if left untreated, can be highly disruptive and potentially lead to hospitalization and even suicide. However, there are effective treatments that can reduce the frequency and severity of mood swings. 3 Problems with substance abuse are common among people with bipolar disorder. Among those with the condition, approximately 42 percent also misuse alcohol, 20 percent also misuse cannabis and 17 percent also misuse other illegal drugs. 4 People with bipolar disorder may self-medicate with alcohol or illegal drugs* to ease distress caused by their symptoms. However, misusing alcohol and drugs can have serious social and health consequences. 5",
    "symptoms": "People with bipolar disorder experience mood swings between mania and depression that last several months. If you think that you or someone you know might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.\n\nManic episodes can feel like an intense state of wellbeing, with unusual reserves of energy. However, the manic phase of bipolar disorder can cause people to lose touch with day-to-day reality and with how other people feel. After a manic episode, people can feel embarrassed or ashamed about their behavior and unable to manage plans that were made while experiencing mania.\n\nThe symptoms of hypomania are similar to mania, but less extreme . Episodes of hypomania last for a few days rather than weeks or months, as is common with mania. It is unusual to have any psychotic symptoms with hypomania.\n\nDuring an episode of depression, a person may feel very low, worthless or tearful. This can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide or even attempted suicide. Periods of extreme low mood or depression can last for at least two weeks, with symptoms interfering with day-to-day life. The contrast between the ‘high’ of mania or hypomania may make an episode of depression even harder to cope with. Read about Signs of Depression »\n\nMixed features, also known as mixed episodes or mixed states, are when people feel symptoms of depression and mania or hypomania at the same time .\n\nIn very severe cases, symptoms of psychosis may develop. In a psychotic episode, a person loses touch with reality. They may see, hear or believe things that the people around them do not.",
    "types": "There are various types of bipolar disorder, sometimes known as bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs). These include:\n\nBipolar I disorder, pronounced as bipolar 1 disorder and sometimes abbreviated as BPI, is defined by: 6 7 Manic episodes that last at least seven days It is common to experience periods of depression, as well, though not in every case Without treatment, a manic episode may last up to six months Manic episodes may be severe enough to require hospitalization\n\nBipolar II disorder, pronounced as bipolar 2 disorder and sometimes abbreviated as BPII is defined by: 6 7 More than one episode of severe depression Episodes of hypomania, that are less severe than those mania episodes seen in Bipolar I disorder\n\nCyclothymic disorder, also referred to as cyclothymia, is similar to bipolar disorder. It is characterized by emotional highs and lows that are not as severe as bipolar disorder, but can still affect day-to-day life. Cyclothymic disorder often goes undiagnosed, but in less than half of cases it can develop into bipolar disorder. 8 Read more about Cyclothymic Disorder » . Good to know: Multiple episodes of mania, hypomania or depression experienced within a year is termed rapid cycling. According to John Hopkins Medicine, the average person with bipolar disorder will experience nine episodes over a lifetime. Someone with rapid cycling bipolar disorder may experience four or more episodes a year. 9 Around 10 to 20 percent of people with bipolar disorder experience rapid cycling. It is more common in people with bipolar II disorder and also more commonly experienced by women. 10",
    "what_causes_bipolar_disorder": "The causes of bipolar disorder are not yet fully understood. Lifetime prevalence (LTP) of bipolar disorder is around 3 to 5 percent. LTP describes the proportion of people who have experienced a condition in their lifetime. There appears to be a genetic link, as the chance of developing bipolar disorder is greater if a family member is also affected. 11 If one parent has bipolar disorder, there is a 25 percent chance a child will develop it. If both parents have bipolar disorder there is a chance of up to 50 percent that a child will develop bipolar disorder. 12 Bipolar disorder may be caused by a problem with the way the brain controls mood. This is why medication is often used to control symptoms. High-stress situations and life-changing events may trigger an episode of depression or mania. 13",
    "how_is_bipolar_disorder_diagnosed": "There is no medical or blood bipolar disorder test. A doctor or other mental health practitioner will make a diagnosis based on conversations with the person affected. 14 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) bipolar disorder criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder require at least one episode of mania, or one episode of hypomania and one episode of depression. 7 International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision (ICD-10) bipolar disorder criteria for diagnosing bipolar disorder requires two or more episodes of prolonged and significantly disturbed mood, consisting of mania, or hypomania and depression. The ICD-10 also classifies episodes of only mania or hypomania as bipolar. 15 It is possible for a person with bipolar disorder to experience an initial episode of depression , and they will therefore not be diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In such cases, treatment with antidepressants may trigger a first episode of mania. If you think that you or someone you know might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "treatment_management": "There is no known cure for bipolar disorder. Treatment aims to stabilize mood and prevent episodes of mania and depression from becoming extreme and to allow the individual to live without disruption.\n\nMedications are a common way of treating bipolar disorder. Some people with the condition need a combination of medications to control mood swings in the most effective way for them. 7 16 17\n\nLithium has been used to stabilize moods for over 50 years, though how it works isn’t fully known. It is mainly used for preventing and stabilizing mania by evening out mood swings, although it can also be prescribed to treat depression. 18 Getting the right dose for each person is very important. If the dose is too low, the drug won’t be effective. If the dose is too high, lithium becomes toxic. People taking lithium need regular blood tests to check the dosage and to ensure the kidneys and thyroid are working properly. Side effects of normal dosage can include: 19 20 Feeling thirsty Urinating more often than usual Nausea Feeling tired Gaining weight Slightly shaky hands Hypothyroidism and goiter – enlarged thyroid gland – can develop with long-term use If there is too much lithium in the body, side effects can include: Feeling very thirsty Diarrhea or vomiting Noticeable shaking of limbs Muscle twitches Being confused The amount of lithium in the body is affected by how much liquid and salt the person takes in. Drinking plenty of non-alcoholic fluids and avoiding a low salt diet is recommended. Lithium use is declining in the United States because of concerns over its side effects and the availability of medications like valproate. However, it is still considered an effective treatment. 21 Taking lithium reduces the chances of having a manic episode within the next year by 30 to 40 percent.\n\nValproate is an anticonvulsant medication which was originally developed to treat epilepsy. It is increasingly used to treat bipolar disorder as a mood stabilizer, particularly in the United States. It is not yet clear how the drug works. Valproate is used to treat mania, rapid cycling and mixed episodes. It is sometimes prescribed along with lithium, as there is a suggestion that the two work more effectively together. 22 Valproate can cause damage to a developing fetus, and should not be taken by women of childbearing age. 23 Other side effects may include: Nausea Feeling shaky Diarrhea Increased appetite and associated weight gain Changes to levels of ammonia and platelets in the blood Carbamazepine and lamotrigine are anticonvulsants that are also used as mood stabilizers. Carbamazepine is thought to be more effective at treating rapid cycling than lithium and causes fewer side effects. Lamotrigine is generally prescribed for treating bipolar II disorder. 16\n\nAntipsychotic medications, such as olanzapine and quetiapine, are used to treat mania . They can also be used in conjunction with mood stabilizers to prevent mania occurring. 24 Antipsychotic medications help by treating bipolar disorder with psychotic features, such as hearing voices, delusions and racing thoughts. They can also help to prevent extreme mood swings and, in some cases, can be used to treat severe depression. 17 These medications work by blocking dopamine in the brain. Side effects may include: Feeling sleepy and sluggish Weight gain Lack of interest in sexual activity Increased chance of developing diabetes High doses can cause limbs to be stiff and shaky\n\nAntidepressant medications are used to treat moderate to severe episodes of depression. For some people, there is a risk that treatment with antidepressants alone can trigger an episode of mania or make rapid cycling more likely. For this reason, it’s recommended that antidepressants, such as fluoxetine 25 , should be prescribed alongside a mood stabilizer. 26 SSRI antidepressants can take two to six weeks to start affecting mood. They are thought to work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. There are many potential side effects when using SSRIs, though most wear off after a few weeks. These side effects include: 17 25 Anxiety Nausea Upset stomach Dizziness Not sleeping enough or sleeping too much Low sex drive It is important not to stop taking SSRIs too soon so as to prevent a recurrence of depression. A course of six to nine months is usually recommended, though in more severe cases, it may be advisable to continue taking SSRIs for longer. A doctor should be consulted before stopping treatment with SSRIs. 27 28\n\nIn between episodes of mania or hypomania and depression, cognitive behavioral or psychotherapy treatments can help. Psychotherapy usually takes place in sessions of one hour over periods of several months. 28\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy is a form of talking therapy that focuses on how thoughts and beliefs affect feelings and behavior. CBT teaches participants coping skills to recognize and deal with problems. 29 For people with bipolar disorder, CBT can help improve awareness of behavior, compliance with treatment plans and day-to-day coping skills. When used alongside medication, a study of 19 randomized control trials found that CBT is effective in reducing the relapse rate and the severity of symptoms. 30\n\nLearning to recognize signs of moods swinging out of control is an important step in managing bipolar disorder. Recognizing early signs can lead to intervention and prevent full episodes of mania and depression, and avoid potential hospitalization. Keeping a mood diary is helpful to track long-term mood changes, as well as possible triggers.\n\nPsychoeducation can help by providing more information about bipolar disorder to the person with the condition, as well as their family and friends. 31 Led by a therapist, group psychoeducation brings together people with similar experiences to share knowledge about how bipolar disorder can affect behavior and how to manage symptoms. Family therapy can help by working together as a family to strengthen relationships, identify risks and develop support skills.\n\nThere are other potential treatments for bipolar disorder if medication and psychotherapeutic interventions are not successful, or if the condition is extreme.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy is a treatment that sends electrical current through the brain to trigger an epileptic seizure. The electricity is administered under general anesthetic and with the use of muscle relaxants, so the body does not convulse. 32 ECT is only advised for rapid, short-term relief of severe depression, mania or psychosis, where other interventions have failed and/or when the condition is considered life-threatening. ECT causes memory loss, which is usually short-term but can be very disorienting.\n\nThere is ongoing research into new mood-stabilizing drugs. Other, non-medication therapies, are also being investigated, including vagal nerve stimulation, transcranial magnetic stimulation and light therapy.\n\nAs well as monitoring day-to-day behavior for signs of mood changes, the knowledge gained from such monitoring can be used to avoid triggering an episode of mania or depression. 33 It can help to have someone to confide in. Close relationships with people who understand the condition and the individual’s experience and trigger points, can be useful as a support network. Too much activity can trigger a manic episode, so it’s helpful to maintain a balance between work and activity, and relaxation and fun.\n\nStress is a common trigger, and avoiding highly stressful situations is recommended. However, it’s not possible to avoid all stress, so a useful tool may be to learn relaxation techniques or take advice on handling stress from a qualified therapist. 34 35\n\nThere is no specific diet recommended for bipolar disorder. However, maintaining a healthy diet will help with overall wellness. 36 37 This includes: Eating a balance of foods rich in nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish, eggs, low-fat meat, nuts and seeds Avoiding food that is high in saturated and trans fats, such as red meat, as well as simple carbohydrates such as refined sugar Lithium can affect salt levels in the body, so care should be taken not to eat too much or too little. 19 Caffeine may contribute to a manic or hypomanic episode by disrupting normal sleep patterns. 38 Exercising for 20 minutes, three times a week, helps to maintain fitness. Exercise also releases endorphins into the brain, which improve mood. 39",
    "bipolar_disorder_in_women": "The presentation and course of bipolar disorder differs in men and women. The following features of bipolar disorder tend to be more common in women than in men: 40 41 Later age of onset Bipolar II disorder Seasonal pattern of mood disturbance Depressive symptoms Rapid cycling Mixed states / features Additional medical and psychiatric disorder conditions, particularly thyroid disease, eating disorders, migraine and anxiety disorders Delayed diagnosis and treatment Women with bipolar disorder tend to have more depressive symptoms and different accompanying conditions than men. There is a high risk of symptoms recurring after giving birth and during menopause. Bipolar disorder in women also correlates with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, weight gain, unplanned pregnancies and cardiovascular disease . Gender is not thought to affect response to mood stabilizing medication, though treatment can pose a risk to the developing fetus in pregnant women. Pregnancy does not protect from nor exacerbate bipolar disorder, so many women require continuation of medication during this time. The time after giving birth, the so-called postpartum period, however, does increase the risk of onset and recurrence of bipolar disorder.\n\nWomen with bipolar disorder who are pregnant , or plan to become pregnant, should talk to their doctor to assess whether their medications are suitable and to discuss how to manage mood during and after pregnancy. 42 Women of childbearing age should not take valproate. If taken while pregnant, there is a high risk of harm to the developing fetus. 22 Lithium is safer than other mood stabilizers to take during pregnancy. There is a low risk to the fetus of developing a heart valve defect during the first three months, but lithium is safe after 26 weeks. Babies should not be breastfed if the mother is taking lithium. 20 Postpartum illnesses are more common for women with bipolar disorder than for the general population. Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis are both serious conditions which could affect a woman’s ability to take care of herself and/or her baby. 43\n\nAround 25 percent of women with bipolar disorder who give birth will experience postpartum depression. 43 Postnatal depression can start at any point in the first year after birth. As well as the usual symptoms of depression, postnatal depression symptoms can include difficulty bonding with the baby and disturbing thoughts about causing the baby harm. 44 Read more about Signs of Postpartum Depression » .\n\nAround 25 percent of women with bipolar disorder who give birth will experience postpartum psychosis. Women who have previously had a severe postpartum illness, and women who have a mother or sister who experienced a severe postpartum illness, are at even higher risk. 43 Symptoms generally begin in the first few days after birth, though they can develop up to six months later. Symptoms are similar to psychosis, including hallucinations and delusions. 45",
    "bipolar_disorder_in_men": "The presentation and course of bipolar disorder differs between men and women. The following features of bipolar disorder tend to be more common in men than in women: 46 47 Manic symptoms Excessive use of alcohol, but also other illicit substances Worse adherence to medication regimen",
    "bipolar_disorder_in_children_and_teenagers": "Usually, symptoms of bipolar disorder first appear in teens around the ages of 15 to 19, though signs can be seen in younger children. The symptoms for mania, hypomania and depression in bipolar disorder are similar to those in adults, although children and teens may behave more erratically. Moods may change more rapidly than in adults, and children may express mania and hypomania as temper tantrums and physical aggression. See our resource on signs of bipolar disorder for more information about bipolar disorder in children, teenagers and young adults. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry urges caution in looking for signs of bipolar disorder in toddlers and children under six years old. 48 If you think that a child in your care might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about their symptoms.",
    "faqs": "Q: What is a bipolar personality? A: Someone with bipolar disorder experiences extreme mood swings, from depressive lows to manic highs. These mood swings are more severe than those which people without bipolar disorder experience and, at worst, need to be treated in hospital. Bipolar is a condition, rather than a personality type. It needs treatment to allow someone to live a life free from disruption. Q: What is the difference between depression and bipolar? A: Someone with bipolar disorder experiences manic episodes alongside depression. Someone with depression without mania does not have bipolar disorder. Read more about the diagnosis of bipolar disorder » Q: Why is bipolar disorder sometimes called manic depression? A: Manic depression is an old name for bipolar disorder, and comes from the two emotional states: mania and depression. Healthcare professionals now use the term bipolar, which also refers to the two extreme emotional states. Q: How common is bipolar disorder? A: Estimates vary, but lifetime prevalence – the proportion of people who have experienced a condition in their lifetime – of bipolar disorder is around 3 to 5 percent. Degrees of impairment vary widely, so some of these people will experience serious impairment, while others may have more moderate symptoms. Q: Is bipolar disorder a disability? A: Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition. With effective treatment, it shouldn’t have a large effect on day-to-day life. However, if the symptoms of bipolar disorder are so severe that it interferes with everyday living or the ability to work, social security benefits may be available. 49 Q: Can you work if you have bipolar disorder? A: With effective treatment to keep symptoms under control, someone with bipolar disorder can continue to work as normal. If symptoms are not under control, it may affect: 49 Working with other people Concentration and memory Understanding Standards of behavior In these circumstances, someone with bipolar disorder may find it difficult to work and may need time to recover. Q: Is bipolar disorder curable? A: Bipolar disorder is not curable, but symptoms can be controlled with treatment. Factors including effectiveness of treatment, social circumstances and genetics may mean that a person with bipolar disorder may experience only one or two episodes in a lifetime. Other people may experience bipolar disorder as a chronic lifetime condition. Read more about the treatment of biploar disorder » Q: How do you know if you have bipolar disorder? A: People with bipolar disorder experience extremes of emotion and mood, unlike others. If you think you have bipolar disorder, a doctor or other mental health professional can talk to you about it. Read more about the diagnosis of bipolar disorder » Q: How do people act when they have bipolar disorder? A: Unless someone with bipolar disorder is experiencing a manic or depressive episode, their behavior won’t be out of the ordinary. If someone is having a manic episode, you might notice their conversation is faster than usual, their train of thought jumps around and that they are easily distracted. They might also be sleeping less, be irritable and thinking up outlandish plans and adventures. If someone is depressed, they may be slow and lacking motivation, have no interest in activities they usually enjoy and/or be tearful and upset. Read more about the symptoms of bipolar disorder » Q: Can you treat bipolar naturally? A: Psychotherapy is recommended as a long-term treatment for bipolar as a way to manage and be aware of changing moods. Relaxation methods, such as meditation may help maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle. However, medication is recommended for stabilizing moods and particularly for treating mania. St John’s Wort, a commonly used complementary therapy for depression, may actually make psychotic symptoms worse. 50 Q: What famous people have bipolar disorder? A: Singer Demi Lovato 49 , actors Jean-Claude Van Damme 51 and Catherine Zeta-Jones 52 and British actor, writer and comedian Stephen Fry 53 all have bipolar disorder. Winston Churchill is believed to have had the condition 54 . Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder and often spoke openly about it 55 . Q: Are bipolar disorder and ADHD related? A: ADHD is a behavioral disorder with symptoms present all the time whereas bipolar is a mood disorder with episodic symptoms. Although symptoms of mania are similar to those of ADHD, the two disorders are not the same. 56 Q: Can bipolar disorder cause hallucinations? A: If someone is experiencing psychosis during a manic episode, they may hallucinate. Q: Is bipolar disorder genetic? A: The causes of the condition are not yet fully understood. There may be a genetic link associated with bipolar disorder as it does seem to run in families, but this hasn’t been confirmed.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/bladder-cancer/",
    "what_is_bladder_cancer": "Bladder cancer is a common cancer that usually develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, it may spread into the bladder muscle. This condition is the ninth most common cancer, occurring more often in men than women. Men are about three times more likely to be diagnosed with bladder cancer than women. 1 The most common symptom is blood in the urine. Treatment and prognosis depend on the size and type of bladder cancer.",
    "types": "The bladder is lined with a type of cells known as transitional cells or urothelial cells, and is surrounded by a thick layer of muscle. The majority of bladder cancers  originate in the transitional cells. This resource deals with transitional cell bladder cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Transitional cell bladder cancer may be divided into two overall groups: 2 3 Superficial or non-muscle invasive tumors. These tumors are more common and occur in about four in five cases of transitional cell bladder cancer. They are confined to the inner lining or just under the inside lining of the bladder. This type of cancer is usually curable as it normally does not metastasize, i.e. spread from where it originally develops to other parts of the body. However, if left untreated, they can develop into muscle-invasive tumors. Muscle-invasive tumors. These tumors have spread to the muscle layer of the bladder or through the outer wall of the bladder. These tumors have a high chance of metastasis, so they are harder to cure. The treatment for these two types of bladder cancer are very different (see treatment).",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "The main symptom of bladder cancer is blood in the urine. This is not usually painful and can come and go. While you should always see a doctor if there is blood in your urine, the Ada app can give you a free initial symptom assessment. Other early symptoms may include: 2 4 Needing to urinate more frequently than usual Needing to urinate very urgently Pain on urination If the cancer is muscle-invasive, other symptoms may develop over time, such as pain in the lower abdomen. If the cancer metastasizes, further signs and symptoms can develop. Good to know: Women are more likely to be diagnosed with later stages of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer symptoms in women are likely to be the same as in men, but many women ignore the main symptom of blood in the urine, which they may associate with menstruation or menopause. Doctors may also initially misdiagnose the bleeding as post-menopausal bleeding or a urinary tract infection , which are more common causes of blood in the urine for women. 5",
    "causes": "Our cells normally divide to make new cells in a controlled way. Cancer first develops in the genes of one cell that becomes abnormal, so that it divides in an uncontrolled way. The abnormal cells often form a tumor, a mass of cells in one area of the body. As the tumor grows, cancer may invade nearby tissues and organs. It is not clear why a cell becomes cancerous or why some people develop cancer while others do not. However, certain factors have been found to be more common in people who develop bladder cancer.",
    "risk_factors": "Risk factors for developing bladder cancer that cannot be changed may include: 2 6 Ethnicity. In the United States, white people develop bladder cancer about twice as often as African American or Hispanic people, while Asian Americans and Native Americans tend to develop bladder cancer slightly less often than many other ethnicities. Increasing age. Over 90 percent of new cases occur in people over the age of 55. Being male. Bladder cancer occurs about three times more often in men than women. Genetics and family medical history. Family members may be exposed to the same cancer-causing chemicals, such as those in tobacco smoke. They may also share certain genetic traits that make bladder cancer more likely to develop, such as in the case of Cowden disease or Lynch syndrome. Previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In particular, the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide can irritate the bladder, increasing the risk of bladder cancer if taken for a long time. People treated with this drug are often advised to drink plenty of fluid to avoid bladder irritation. Risk factors which can be controlled and may therefore be helpful to know in order to lessen the risk of bladder cancer, include: 2 6 Using tobacco products. People who smoke tobacco are at least three times more likely to get bladder cancer. Smoking is known to cause about half of all bladder cancers in both men and women. Certain chemical exposures. Industries using chemicals that can cause bladder cancer include dye, rubber, leather, textiles, paint and printing. Chronic bladder irritation and infections. Chronic bladder irritation, such as can be caused by bladder catheters left in place a long time, urinary tract infections , bladder and kidney stones are all linked with bladder cancer. Not drinking enough. This may be because drinking plenty of fluid causes a person to empty their bladder more often, which could keep cancer-associated chemicals from lingering in the bladder. Certain medicines or herbal supplements. The diabetes medicine pioglitazone has been linked with bladder cancer. Aristolochic acid, contained in some dietary supplements, has also been linked with bladder cancer. Arsenic in drinking water. However, drinking water is not likely to be a major source of arsenic in the developed world.",
    "diagnosis": "If a person has blood in their urine, they should go to a doctor. A sample of urine from the affected person may be analysed in a laboratory to look for the presence of blood, bacteria or cancer cells. It can also rule out other, more likely causes of blood in the urine, such as a urinary tract infection . The doctor may also carry out a physical examination of the rectum – the final section of the large intestine, terminating at the anus – and/or vagina. This is because bladder cancer may cause a lump that can be felt by pressing against the walls of the rectum and/or vagina. If bladder cancer is suspected, a person may be referred to hospital for further tests. These tests may include: 7 8\n\nBlood tests normally include: A Complete Blood Count (CBC) A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nThis is a procedure to look at the inside of the bladder. It involves passing a thin tube with a camera and light at one end through the urethra, the tube through which a person urinates. A local or general anesthetic may be used so that the procedure is painless.\n\nAn ultrasound will usually be done to create a picture of the bladder and surrounding area to look for tumors. It involves a transducer being passed over the skin of the abdomen, which sends sound waves to create a picture of the internal organs. A person will be asked to have a full bladder for a first scan, then to empty their bladder before a second scan. An ultrasound can’t always find small tumors, so an MRI or CT scan may also be used to get a more detailed image of the bladder. An intravenous (IV) urogram may also be used to look at the whole urinary tract. This involves injecting dye into the bloodstream and then using  X-rays to study the dye as it moves through the urinary system.\n\nIf abnormal tissue is found during a cystoscopy , a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT) will be done. This is a type of biopsy in which any tumor, a sample of the bladder muscle near the tumor and possibly from other parts of the bladder are removed and examined under a microscope. A TURBT may also be used as a treatment method for a non-muscle invasive tumor (see treatment).",
    "bladder_cancer_staging": "Once bladder cancer is diagnosed, doctors will try to find out whether it has spread and, if so, how far, in a process known as staging. The staging system most often used for bladder cancer is the TNM system, developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).",
    "treatment": "The treatment required depends on the exact type of bladder cancer and the extent to which it has spread. Treatments usually differ significantly between non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Treatment options for bladder cancer also depend on the overall health of the affected person. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.\n\nCases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer are normally treated by surgery. It’s usually possible to do this with a TURBT, i.e. removing the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact (see transurethral resection of a bladder tumor . TURBT is usually followed by one dose of chemotherapy to reduce the risk of the cancer returning. The chemotherapy medication is administered directly into the bladder using a catheter that is inserted through the urethra, i.e. the thin tube that carries urine out of the bladder. This method of administration reduces the chemotherapy side effects . 3 In cases of higher recurrence risk, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy may be used. This is a type of immunotherapy for bladder cancer. BCG is a germ that doesn’t usually cause serious disease, but attracts the body’s immune system to the bladder, so that it may fight against bladder cancer cells. BCG therapy is intravesical, meaning a liquid drug is put directly into the bladder, rather than being taken by mouth or injected into a vein. This means that the drug acts on the bladder lining, with little or even no effects on other parts of the body. 9 Good to know: BCG therapy can cause flu-like symptoms . Rarely, BCG can spread to other parts of the body, where it can cause serious infection. A high fever may be a sign of serious infection; if this is experienced, medical attention should be sought as soon as possible.\n\nTreatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer or high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, may involve removing the bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy. If the bladder is removed, another way of collecting urine will be created at the same time as the cystectomy. This may involve one of the following: 3 Creating a new bladder out of a section of the bowel Making an opening  in the abdomen so urine can be passed out into an external bag If it is possible to avoid removing the bladder or if surgery is not advisable, a course of chemotherapy may be recommended, sometimes combined with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may sometimes be used before surgery on its own or combined with radiotherapy. 3",
    "prognosis": "In many cases, bladder cancer can be cured. However, the likelihood of this depends upon the type of bladder cancer and what stage it is at (see bladder cancer staging ). People who have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer have a fairly high chance of recovery. People with muscle-invasive bladder cancer can sometimes make a full recovery. Bladder cancer that has spread to other parts of the body tends to be much more difficult to cure, but some people do have long-term positive responses to treatment. 10\n\nThe prognosis of cancer is calculated by looking at survival rates. Survival rates show what percentage of people live for a certain length of time after being diagnosed with cancer. Not everyone who is diagnosed with a cancer wants to know this information. They are based on averages taken from huge numbers of people and do not predict what will happen to an individual. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer has a good prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of 82 to 100 percent. 11 The 5-year survival rate decreases with increasing stage.",
    "faqs": "Q: Is bladder cancer curable? A: This depends on the individual case of bladder cancer. Superficial or non-muscle invasive tumors tend to be curable as they normally do not metastasize, i.e. spread from where they originally develop to other parts of the body.

This is not necessarily an illness, but this can make some parts of their life difficult. People with a borderline personality tend to have unstable moods and difficulty controlling their thoughts and emotions. These people tend to act impulsively. These traits sometimes lead to self-harming behavior, difficulty in relationships and overreactions to stressful events. These personality traits tend to develop in people who have had a difficult childhood or adolescence. Treatment can be achieved through psychological counseling.",
    "risks": "The personality is the way that a person reacts to people and events in their life. The personality is formed during childhood as a result of family relationships, childhood experiences and difficulties. Personality traits may also be partially inherited from one's parents. If people develop personality traits which cause them difficulty in their life, this is called a personality disorder. A major cause of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a traumatic life experience in childhood. This may include parental neglect, sexual abuse or physical violence. This condition is relatively common; it is estimated that up to 3 percent of the general population may have the personality traits of BPD. It tends to affect women more commonly than men. The personality traits tend to cause the most problems in early adulthood and become less troublesome as people grow older.",
    "symptoms": "People with a borderline personality tend to: Have unstable moods and difficulty controlling their thoughts and emotions Often feel conflicting emotions Act impulsively and, sometimes, aggressively These traits sometimes lead to: Self-harming behavior Difficulty in relationships Overreactions to stressful events These people may find they experience similar problems in different relationships. They may also be involved in risky behaviors, such as: Drug consumption Eating disorders A tendency to cause themselves harm",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is made after a thorough psychological assessment, which considers multiple aspects of a person's life. The diagnosis is often difficult as people with borderline personality disorder have often had multiple complicated experiences which have formed their personality. To make the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, a doctor should exclude other causes for the symptoms, such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder.",
    "treatment": "Therapy aims to teach people with these personality traits how to manage difficulties and relationships and how to manage impulsive behavior. This is usually done by a psychologist. It can take time for a person with BPD to learn new ways of dealing with problems, but this therapy can be effective if a person is determined. Medications might be prescribed to help symptoms of depression or anxiety, because people with BPD often also have these conditions.",
    "prevention": "It is difficult to prevent borderline personality disorder. Providing stable, loving support for a child or young person who is going through difficult times may help, as may early recognition and treatment of difficult personality traits."

    "condition": "Brain Stem Stroke",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/brain-stem-stroke/",
    "what_is_brain_stem_stroke": "A brain stem stroke occurs when there is a blockage obstructing the flow of blood to the brain stem ‒ the base of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. A brain stem stroke can be due to either: 1 2 A blood clot or other obstruction in the blood vessels, known as an ischemic stroke Blood coming out of a blood vessel, known as a hemorrhagic stroke Ischemic strokes are overall far more common than hemorrhagic strokes. Around one in ten ischemic strokes takes place in the brain stem. 3 An acronym, FAST, explains the telltale signs that a stroke is taking place: 1 2 Face. The face becomes weak or droopy, with the effect usually more visible on one side Arm. One arm becomes numb or weak, and there may be difficulty raising it Speech. Speaking becomes difficult, and the affected person’s voice becomes slurred Time to call. If any of the above is noticed, the emergency services should be called immediately. The brain stem and the blood vessels that supply it play a vital role in the following bodily functions: Breathing Heart rate Digestion Balance Vision Hearing Any of the above can be affected by a brain stem stroke. Vertigo, the feeling that the body is moving even if it is not, is by no means an indication on its own that anything is severely wrong. However, vertigo can sometimes be caused by a brain stem stroke. Therefore, if a doctor discovers that a person experienced vertigo during a stroke, then it can be one indication that it was a stroke affecting the brainstem, especially in conjunction with other typical symptoms being present. A number of other health conditions, particularly high blood pressure, increase the risk of stroke. Strokes also become more likely as a person gets older or engages in certain behaviours, like smoking. The best means for lowering the risk of stroke is to live a healthy life with a good diet, not smoking and getting plenty of exercise or movement.",
    "symptoms": "The brain stem is vital for many bodily functions, including: Body movement Processing sights and sounds Eye movement Sleeping Breathing Swallowing Biting Chewing Blood pressure Sneezing Any of the above could be affected by a brain stem stroke. The specific symptoms depend on the part of the brainstem affected and whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. The three parts of the brainstem are: The midbrain The pons The medulla These are supplied by multiple arteries, some of which split up to carry blood to the left and right sides of the brain.\n\nVertigo and dizziness. A brain stem stroke can cause a person to feel like they have lost a sense of where their body is in space. Vertigo is the feeling that the body is moving when a person is actually standing or sitting still. This sensation may also lead to a feeling of nausea and subsequently lead to vomiting. 3 7 8 Changes to hearing. Some ischemic brain stem strokes can lead to the perception of sounds when none are present, otherwise known as tinnitus. The person affected may also become more sensitive to certain sounds or frequencies, a condition known as hyperacusis. 3 Changes to eye movements. One or both of the person’s eyes may move in an unusual way during and after a brain stem stroke. The eyes may involuntarily move from side to side or up and down. One eye may stay off-centre, or the eyelid may appear droopy. The affected person’s pupils may become smaller. The ways the eyes are affected by a brain stem stroke can cause the vertigo and dizziness described above and may also lead to double vision. 3 7 8 9 Loss of coordination of muscle control Medically known as ataxia, this is when the affected person is unable to control their muscles properly. This can lead them to lose balance or fall to the floor. 3 7 9 Weakness on one side of the body. Otherwise known as hemiparesis, this can affect the entirety of the body or specific areas, such as the face, tongue or arms 3 7 9 Loss of ability to speak. Otherwise known as dysarthria, a person affected by brain stem stroke may find it difficult to speak in the way that they usually do. Speech may be slurry, or the person may not be able to talk at all. Other parts of the throat, mouth or tongue may be affected by a brain stem stroke causing difficulties in swallowing, for example. 3 7 9 Loss of body feeling. A person affected by brain stem stroke might find it harder to feel pain or changes in temperature. This sensation may only affect certain parts of the body, such as the face, arms, chest or tongue. They may also perceive sensations in incorrect places, like when the foot is touched, it may feel like the leg is touched. 3 7 9 Difficulty swallowing. There may be an unusual feeling on the inside of the mouth, tongue or throat. This can also contribute to difficulty speaking, swallowing or eating. 3 7 Unusual breathing patterns. A person may find it difficult to breathe as they usually would.  Doctors may need to take action to help the person breathe during treatment. 7\n\nLocked-in syndrome is a rare condition that usually happens when there is damage to the part of the brain stem called the pons, e.g. through a stroke. One of the reasons the pons is important is, because it transmits information between the brain and the spinal cord. Locked-in syndrome occurs when all of these signals that are important in controlling muscle movement in the body are disrupted. The parts of the brainstem that control facial movement and speaking are also affected during locked-in syndrome: 7 A person is quadriplegic, which means they have little or no ability to move their arms, legs or torso They are unable to speak They remain conscious and able to perceive the world A person affected by this syndrome generally can only move their eyes and blink after the stroke has taken place. Their ability to breathe and swallow may also be affected.\n\nA hemorrhagic stroke in the blood vessels supplying the brain stem is much rarer than an ischemic stroke. However, when bleeding does occur in this part of the brain, then the consequences are usually severe, and there is a high risk of the person not surviving the stroke. The following symptoms are all common outcomes of a brain stem hemorrhage: 3 An inability to see straight with eyes moving out of their normal position Weakness in both the arms and the legs Difficulty breathing, eating or swallowing Loss of consciousness and coma",
    "causes": "Brain stem strokes are caused by the blood supply to part of the brain stem getting cut off, either due to a blockage in the blood vessels (ischemic stroke) or due to bleeding in the blood vessels supplying the brain stem (hemorrhagic stroke).\n\nAtherosclerosis. A condition in which fatty deposits, known as plaques, build up on the walls of arteries. This causes the arteries to become harder, narrower and potentially blocked. 3 10 Small vessel disease. This is an umbrella term describing a number of abnormal changes to the small arteries and veins in the brain. This can lead to effects including tiny bleeds or small blockages that reduce blood flow. This continued damage to the blood vessels increases the risk of a stroke occurring. An MRI or CT brain scan is usually necessary to detect small vessel disease.  The most common cause of small vessel disease is high blood pressure (hypertension ). 3 10 11 Artery dissection. A more common cause of stroke in patients aged under 45, artery dissection is when the inner lining of an artery becomes torn causing blood to build up. This can lead to a blood clot that blocks the artery and causes ischemic stroke. Artery dissection can also cause an aneurysm, which is when part of the artery wall becomes weakened and bulges outwards. If this bulged-out structure does not hold, and blood begins to escape, then this can lead to hemorrhagic stroke. 3 10 11 Read more about Causes of Ischemic Stroke »\n\nIn a hemorrhagic stroke,  damage is caused by bleeding in or around the brain.  The resulting collection of blood coming out of the bleed begins to put pressure upon and damages the brain tissue surrounding the bleeding site. This initial injury can lead to further swelling and inflammation within the brain, putting it under more pressure. Although a big part of the brain injury from a hemorrhagic stroke occurs because of the initial bleed, continued bleeding and the later swelling can lead to even more complications. That is why it is so important to get a stroke treated as quickly as possible. 12 13 Read more about the Causes of Hemorrhagic Stroke »",
    "risk_factors": "The risk factors for stroke in the brain stem are largely the same as for other types of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke . 3 Nearly three quarters of those affected by a sudden stroke have high-blood pressure . This makes high-blood pressure the most common risk factor for stroke. 14 High blood pressure often shows no specific symptoms, unless it is suddenly rising and/or very severe; this means that many people affected by high blood pressure will not be aware that they have it. 1 High-blood pressure is made more likely by living an unhealthy lifestyle. This is also true of several other risk factors for stroke, including: 1 High levels of cholesterol and Hyperlipidemia Heart disease Diabetes All of the above conditions can also be genetically influenced in rarer cases, but taking the following steps can substantially lower the risk of them developing: 1 3 10 Following a balanced and varied diet, rich in vegetables and fruits, high in unprocessed, whole foods Stopping smoking or chewing tobacco products Getting enough exercise or generally plenty of movement Drinking less alcohol Not taking stimulant drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines and crystal meth Other risk factors for stroke include: 1 3 10 Atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm Vasculitis, which is when blood vessels inside the brain become swollen and inflamed due to infection or to conditions affecting the immune system Old age. Most strokes happen to those aged over 65 Certain inherited conditions that weaken the blood vessels, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and fibromuscular dysplasia Brain infection, such as encephalitis Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a buildup of proteins on the walls of the arteries in the brain Brain tumors Arteriovenous malformations, an abnormal connection between blood vessels Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) Postmenopausal hormone therapy Good to know: There is an ongoing debate whether spinal manipulation as performed by chiropractors could increase the risk of stroke, particularly at the base of the brain. The research on this topic is continually evolving, and it is impossible to say with any certainty how close the link is. However, there is likely to be some connection between brain stem stroke and spinal manipulation. 15",
    "diagnosis": "Anyone displaying signs of stroke should immediately be taken to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis. This will usually begin with a physical examination and a review of a person’s medical history. Brain scans are needed to confirm whether the person is affected by a stroke and, if so, what type of stroke it is.\n\nA brain scan can help determine: 1 If a stroke has taken place Whether the stroke is hemorrhagic or ischemic The damage that has been caused to the brain thus far It can also help detect any potential brain abnormalities that may have contributed to or caused the stroke. Given the risk of ongoing damage from an untreated stroke, a brain scan must be carried out promptly after the affected person reaches a hospital.\n\nA ct scan is generally one of the first tests made after a suspected stroke, because it is much quicker than an MRI scan. 3 CT scans use X-Ray technology.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. An MRI scan usually provides a more detailed picture than a CT scan, so could be beneficial given injuries in the brain stem can be very small. 3\n\nIn the early stages of a brain stem stroke, the blockage or bleed in the brain stem may be too hard to detect by a standard CT scan. In this case, a doctor may insert a small amount of dye in the blood before performing the scan. 3 In both a computed tomography angiogram (CTA scan) and a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), the dye is usually injected through an intravenous drip in the arm. It can also be injected into a vein on the back of the hand or via a thin tube, known as a catheter, through another blood vessel.",
    "treatment": "Brain stem strokes are a medical emergency, and a person affected by one will need to be taken to a hospital to be treated immediately. After this initial treatment, rehabilitation and other forms of aftercare may be needed.\n\nThe immediate treatment of a brain stem stroke depends on: The type of stroke The severity of symptoms The parts of the brain stem involved The first step is generally to stabilize the person affected, making sure that they can breathe and taking any lifesaving measures necessary\n\nIf a brain stem stroke is caused by a blood clot, then medication can be given that can break down the clot and allow blood to flow normally through the blood vessel again. This process is known as thrombolysis and should be administered within a few hours of symptoms starting to show. 10\n\nIn some cases, the doctor may choose to apply the clot-dissolving medication directly to the blood clot to aid removal. This is achieved by inserting a catheter into the affected person’s groin and maneuvering it up to the affected blood vessel supplying the affected brain stem area. 10\n\nIf the stroke becomes hemorrhagic, then the aim of  hospital treatment will be to stop the bleeding and reduce any pressure on the brain.  This generally includes a mixed treatment approach, including surgery and medications. Read more about Treatment for Hemorrhagic Stroke »\n\nAfter a brain stem stroke, the person affected may need assistance with breathing. This may involve the insertion of a tube down a person’s windpipe to deliver air to the lungs or simply a mask that delivers air through the nostrils. 10 16 Swallowing and other involuntary functions might be affected by the stroke. For example, the affected person may be at higher risk of aspiration pneumonia , which is when fluids or solid particles, such as food, go into the windpipe or lungs.\n\nFollowing a brain stem stroke a person’s physical abilities are often restricted. The amount to which the person is affected can vary from a feeling of numbness or weakness to total paralysis of the body (locked-in syndrome). This can lead to several potential problems including: 10 16 Deep vein thrombosis, potentially dangerous blood clots which are more likely to form if the person is not moving around for long periods Unhealthy nutrition, because of difficulty swallowing or chewing Aspiration pneumonia, a type of pneumonia caused by food or drinks being accidentally inhaled into the lungs Skin problems, due to increased pressure on the skin caused by the lack of movement Falls and other accidents related to a sudden loss of balance and/or physical weakness Breathing issues Most of these can be managed with good nursing care and the help of a physical therapist to assist with how the problems can be avoided, once the person is discharged from hospital and after possibly further in- and/or outpatient rehabilitation.\n\nA physical therapist will help with addressing the problems caused by a stroke in the brain stem. This includes helping a person with: 7 10 Balance Gait Wheelchair usage, if necessary Eye movement problems\n\nAn occupational therapist will assist a person affected by stroke in regaining the ability to complete tasks necessary for living day to day, such as: Getting dressed Washing the body Eating Getting around This therapy will often involve a person’s family or people they are close with. An occupational therapist can assist with accessing further help, such as a wheelchair or devices that make getting in and out of a bath easier.\n\nA person may have difficulty speaking or swallowing after a stroke in the brain stem. An inability to speak can cause frustration and make it difficult for the affected person to communicate their needs. An inability to swallow can lead to difficulty eating and getting the right nutrition, as well as some other conditions such as aspiration pneumonia. Speech and language therapists will be able to help a person overcome or deal best with these difficulties, which can improve over time. 7 10\n\nAfter a stroke, many people experience emotional problems, feel fearful of living with future complications or long-term disability and may feel a loss of confidence in accomplishing everyday tasks or social activities. These problems may include: 18 19 20 Low, depressed mood and mood swings Clinical depression Crying or laughing easily, sometimes with no apparent reason or in socially inappropriate situations Feeling angry a lot more than previously The feeling that the person’s personality has changed Developing generalized anxiety disorder Developing post traumatic stress disorder Denial about the consequences of the stroke and needing help in day-to-day tasks Emotional difficulties tend to improve with time and treatment, and there are various treatment options available to help and support someone experiencing them, including: Support groups such as those the registered with the National Stroke Association Talking therapies, such as psychotherapy Medications, such as antidepressants",
    "faqs": "Q: What is the prognosis for a brain stem stroke? A: Following a brain stem stroke, long-term disability or a person not surviving the stroke are a serious risk. A medical professional will be able to give guidance and support regarding a person’s long-term prognosis, but it is often hard to predict the outcome accurately and, in the end, people may fare worse or much better than previously estimated. Q: What is the survival rate for brain stem stroke? A: It is difficult to give an accurate figure for the survival rate of brain stem stroke as a whole. This is because it depends so greatly on where in the brainstem the stroke takes place, whether the stroke is hemorrhagic or ischemic and several other factors. For example, in a study of patients at a New England medical center, the majority affected by posterior circulation stroke survived. 21 However, another study shows that an ischemic stroke in the basilar artery, which supplies the pons part of the brain stem, carries a high mortality risk. 22 Q: Are there any brain stem stroke recovery stories? A: Yes. While rehabilitation and recovery after a stroke are difficult, there are numerous cases of survivors recovering the majority of their motor and cognitive functions after one has taken place. Support groups, such as those the registered with the National Stroke Association , often offer opportunities to meet other stroke survivors. Healthtalk.org includes a number of recovery stories by people of all ages.",

    "condition": "Breast Cancer",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/breast-cancer/",
    "what_is_breast_cancer": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. It is estimated that about one in eight women in the U.S. will develop breast cancer. 1 Breast cancer is most common in women over 50 years of age, though it can occur in younger women and, rarely, in men. Although there may be no symptoms in the early stages, some people may have a painless lump in the breast, skin changes on the breast or discharge from the nipple. Testing people with no symptoms, known as screening, is important to diagnose breast cancer in the early stages. Breast cancer that is discovered early has a good chance of recovery and cure. If diagnosed early, surgery to remove the tissue affected by breast cancer in its entirety, along with local radiation therapy, may cure a person of this condition. If diagnosed at a later stage, when the breast cancer has spread, treatments that affect the whole body, such as chemotherapy, are often necessary. Always seek medical attention if breast cancer is suspected. However, there are less serious causes for changes in the breast that are more common, such as fibrocystic breasts .",
    "types": "There are many types of breast cancer. Sometimes, one breast tumor can be a combination of two or several different types. Breast cancer types include the following: 2 3\n\nThe female breast is made up of sections called lobes. Each of these is made up of many smaller lobules, which produce milk in nursing women. Lobes and lobules are connected by milk ducts, which act as tubes to carry the milk to the nipple. These breast structures are generally where breast cancer begins to form. In its earliest stage, it is known as in-situ breast cancer.\n\nDCIS is considered by some doctors to be an early form of breast cancer and by others to be a precancerous condition, which may develop into cancer. In DCIS, there are cancerous cells inside the walls of the breast’s milk ducts, but they have not grown through the walls of the ducts. DCIS is highly curable through surgery to remove the affected area and prevent the possibility of these cells spreading to surrounding breast tissue. Sometimes, radiation therapy is necessary after surgery. Chemotherapy is not necessary for women with DCIS.\n\nLCIS is not actually considered to be cancerous. In LCIS, cells that are like cancer cells are growing in the lobules of the breast, but they have not grown through the walls of the lobules. LCIS does not require treatment, but women with LCIS may be recommended for more regular screenings, as they are considered to be at higher risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nInvasive breast cancer of no special type (NST), previously known as invasive ductal breast cancer, not otherwise specified (NOS), is the most common type of breast cancer, making up about 8 out of 10 invasive breast cancers, i.e. cancers that have spread beyond the initial layer of tissue where they developed and are growing into surrounding, healthy tissues. Invasive lobular cancer is another type of invasive breast cancer, which starts in the milk-producing glands.\n\nThis type of breast cancer is caused by cancer cells blocking lymph vessels in the skin. The lymph vessels are part of the immune system. They normally drain excess tissue fluid away from the body tissues and organs. The lymph vessels can’t do this job properly if they are blocked. Instead, they cause symptoms of inflammation, such as swelling and redness. Inflammatory breast cancer is uncommon, accounting for 1 to 5 percent of all breast cancers.\n\nBreast cancer cells often have receptors that hormones or other proteins can attach to and stimulate the cancer to grow. Receptor cells can be used to treat many breast cancers by blocking the hormones or proteins from attaching to the receptors. Triple negative breast cancer does not have the following key receptors: 4 Estrogen Progesterone HER2 protein This means that hormone treatment and the targeted cancer drug trastuzumab do not work on triple negative cancers. Instead, the main treatments for triple negative breast cancer are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Triple negative breast cancer is usually diagnosed using a sample of the cancer to test the cells for these receptors, after a biopsy or after surgery to remove the cancer. Good to know: Triple negative cancer is an uncommon type of breast cancer; about 15 out of every 100 breast cancers are triple negative. Basal-like breast cancer, a rare type of breast cancer in which the cells resemble the basal cells that line the breast ducts, is normally triple negative.\n\nHER2-positive breast cancer  has receptors for HER2 proteins. These cancers tend to grow faster and may have a worse prognosis. They are often successfully treated, however, with targeted therapies aimed at the HER2 protein, such as trastuzumab.\n\nAlso known as Paget disease of the breast, Paget’s disease of the nipple is a rare type of breast cancer. It starts in the breast ducts before spreading to the skin of the nipple and then the areola – the dark line circling the nipple. It usually affects only one nipple and can look very similar to eczema , with crusted, scaly and red skin, sometimes itching or burning. Blood or yellow fluid may be coming out of the nipple. The nipple may also look flat or inverted. Paget disease usually develops from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 5",
    "breast_cancer_symptoms": "Early signs of breast cancer include a painless lump or mass in the breast. However, many people with early breast cancer will have no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms of breast cancer include: 6 7 A painless lump or mass in the breast: This may not be seen, but might be felt. Change in breast size or shape: For example, one breast might become larger or lower than the other. Changes in skin texture: This could be thickening, puckering or dimpling of the skin of the breast. Change in breast color: The breast might look red or inflamed. Change in nipple shape: The nipple of the affected breast might become inverted when it normally points out. Rash or crusting over the nipple: This also may affect the surrounding area. Nipple discharge: Discharge from one nipple, especially if it’s bloodstained Pain in a breast or armpit that is there all or almost all of the time Lumps or swellings in the armpit or around the collarbone Good to know: Most breast lumps are not cancerous; 80 percent of those tested with a biopsy are not found to be cancerous. 8 However, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible if a person suspects they may have breast cancer. For a free symptom assessment, try the Ada app .",
    "causes": "Breast cancer occurs when abnormal cells develop in the breast tissue and grow quickly and uncontrollably. These cells destroy and replace the normal breast tissue and may spread through the body.\n\nRisk factors for breast cancer include: 9 10 Gender: Being female Age: Being older than 50 Family history: Having a close relative who has either breast, uterine or ovarian cancer Genetic inheritance: particularly the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes A previous diagnosis of breast cancer Being overweight: Fat cells produce estrogen Excessive alcohol consumption: Research shows that drinking alcoholic beverages increases the risk of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, as it can increase levels of estrogen and other hormones associated with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. Alcohol also may increase breast cancer risk by damaging DNA in cells Using tobacco products: This is linked to a higher risk of breast cancer in younger, premenopausal women. There may also be a link  in postmenopausal women between very heavy second-hand smoke exposure and breast cancer risk Not being physically active: Exercise consumes and controls blood sugar and limits blood levels of insulin growth factor, a hormone that can affect how blood cells grow and behave Not having children: Women who have not had a full-term pregnancy or have their first child after age 30 may have a higher risk of breast cancer compared with those women who have given birth before the age of 30 Not breastfeeding: Breastfeeding can lower the risk, especially if done for longer than one year Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Some types of HRT use after menopause , though not all, may result in an increased risk",
    "breast_cancer_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms in patients being treated for breast cancer. This is because cancer therapy weakens the immune system, which puts you at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Taking the necessary precautions and getting tested as soon as possible if you start experiencing symptoms is crucial. Treatment options are available.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made during breast cancer screening. Screening is important because it allows breast cancer to be detected and treated at an early stage. The earlier the cancer is found, the better the chances of surviving it. Breast cancer screening is normally done by mammogram, a type of X-Ray scan. 11 In order to rule out a cancer diagnosis, a test, known as a biopsy may be carried out that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from an area suspected to be cancerous. Local anesthetic may be administered, depending on the type of biopsy used. If you are worried that you may be experiencing symptoms of breast cancer, try using the Ada app to find out more.\n\nA mammogram is an X-ray of the breasts that looks for changes that may be signs of breast cancer, such as small white spots called calcifications and lumps or tumors. A mammogram is the best breast cancer screening test, though it is possible to have a mammogram give an incorrect result, miss the presence of a cancer or show cancer-like structures which are in fact benign. 12 Women under the age of 40 do not often have a mammogram. This is because it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of younger women’s breasts, which are denser, using a mammogram.\n\nUltrasound may be used to look at breast changes that cannot be seen on a mammogram, such as if a woman has very dense breasts or as a follow-up test if a mammogram shows a breast lump.\n\nA biopsy is a test that removes tissue or sometimes fluid from a part of the body. Cells are then examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of breast cancer. Good to know: About 80 percent of women who have breast biopsies do not have breast cancer. There are three types of biopsy that may be used to test for breast cancer: 2 13\n\nIf the lump is easily accessible or is likely to be filled with fluid, a doctor may perform a fine needle aspiration (FNA), in which fluid is drawn through a needle. The lump should collapse once the fluid inside has been drawn. If the lump persists, the cells in the sample may be examined.\n\nThis involves using a larger needle through which a small amount of tissue can be removed. Local anesthetic will be used.\n\nA surgical biopsy is done with local anesthesia and, usually, sedation. This involves removal of all or part of an abnormal lump.",
    "breast_cancer_stages": "Once breast cancer is diagnosed, doctors will try to find out whether it has spread and, if so, how far, in a process known as staging. The staging system most often used  for breast cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system, based on tumor size, number and location of lymph nodes 14 with cancer. The cancer may then be given a number stage from 1 to 4, often followed by subdivisions of a, b or c. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A general overview of the stages is as follows: 15 16 Stage 0 breast cancer is the earliest stage, also known as carcinoma in situ. This stage is used to describe breast cancer that is within the breast ducts or milk glands and has not spread. It is usually curable by surgery to remove the affected area. Stage 1 breast cancer is invasive, meaning it has invaded other surrounding tissues and may involve N1mic, which means that there is micrometastasis, i.e. tiny amounts of cancer cells, in nearby lymph nodes in tiny amounts. Stage 2 breast cancer means the tumor has grown to somewhere between the size of a walnut and a lime, spread to nearby lymph nodes, or both. **Stage 3 breast cancer has not spread to bones or organs, but is considered advanced and harder to treat. It may have spread to a significant number of lymph nodes or grown into the chest wall or skin around the breast. Stage 4 breast cancer has spread to distant sites, most commonly the bones, lungs, liver and brain, in what is known as metastasis. Other factors may also affect what stage is given to a case of breast cancer, including: 15 16 Tumor grade: How abnormal the cancer cells look under the microscope Estrogen and progesterone receptor status: Whether the cancer cells have receptors for these hormones HER2 status: Whether the cancer cells are overproducing the HER2 protein Oncotype DX score: If the cancer is estrogen-receptor-positive, HER2-negative and there is no cancer in the lymph nodes",
    "treatment": "The extent of the treatment required for breast cancer depends on the extent to which it has spread and the exact type of cancer. It may be possible to remove the entirety of the affected area(s) with surgery and localised radiotherapy. However, breast cancer that has spread to multiple sites within the body may require a combined approach. Treatment options for breast cancer will depend on the overall health of the affected person, their specific medical circumstances and how far the cancer has spread.\n\nThere are many different types of surgery for breast cancer. What a doctor recommends will depend on the state of the cancer and the affected person’s wishes and feelings. Types of breast cancer surgery may include: 17 Breast conserving surgery, which removes only the area of the cancer Mastectomy – surgery to remove the whole breast Breast reconstruction Removing the lymph nodes\n\nAlso known as radiotherapy, radiation therapy uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Side effects of radiation for breast cancer are normally relatively easy to tolerate and are mostly limited to the treated area in the form of rashes and other skin irritation. 18 A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side effects, should they occur.\n\nThe general aims of chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer are to destroy any cancer cells and increase the likelihood of recovery. Chemotherapy can sometimes have unpleasant side effects, such as hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side effects, should they occur. Read more about Chemotherapy Side Effects » .\n\nSome breast cancers, known as receptor-positive cancers, are stimulated by estrogen or progesterone,  hormones produced in the body that help the cancer to grow. Hormone therapy, also known as endocrine therapy, is a treatment that blocks hormones in the body from acting on breast cancer cells or lowers the levels present. 19 Hormone therapy can sometimes have side effects, such as hot flushes, reduced libido and mood changes. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side effects.\n\nImmunotherapy aims to activate a person’s immune system to recognize and kill their tumors. Some are now approved for treatment of certain HER2 breast cancers, while others are being studied further. 20",
    "prevention": "The causes of breast cancer are not fully  understood, so it’s not known if it can be prevented. However, there are some general preventive measures that may be taken and some treatments available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition.\n\nGeneral measures that may help prevent breast cancer include: 21 22 Regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet: Maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent many forms of cancer, including breast cancer. Breastfeeding: This has been found to lower the risk of developing breast cancer. It may be because women don’t ovulate as regularly when they’re breastfeeding, so their estrogen levels remain more stable.\n\nWomen who are at high risk of breast cancer, as determined by factors such as age, family medical history and genetic testing, may be offered medical treatments to prevent breast cancer. The two main treatments that may help prevent breast cancer are: 21 23\n\nThis can be used to treat breast cancer, to prevent recurrence and to reduce the chance of developing the condition for women at high risk. This surgery can reduce risk of breast cancer by up to 90 percent. However, like all operations, there’s a risk of complications, and some women experience significant effects on their body image and sexual relationships. Surgical breast reconstruction is also available. In some cases, a nipple-sparing mastectomy may be available.\n\nHormonal medications are available to reduce a person’s risk of developing breast cancer. However, these medications may cause side effects such as hot flushes, nausea and tiredness and have a small risk of more serious problems, such as osteoporosis , blood clots or womb cancer.",
    "prognosis": "Prognosis is estimated by looking at what happened over to many years to large groups of people diagnosed with the same stage of cancer, known as survival rates. Survival rates show what percentage of people live for a certain length of time after being diagnosed with cancer. Survival rates are generally sorted into 5-year and 10-year time brackets. Because the statistic is based on people diagnosed over five years ago, the outlook may be better for those diagnosed today, since there are continuing improvements in treatment. Survival rates include people who are free of disease or who experience few symptoms, as well as those who are still being treated for cancer, those who will survive for many more years and those who will not live much longer than the time bracket given. Five-year survival rates for people with breast cancer in the U.S. are currently as follows: 24 Localized breast cancer: About 62 percent of breast cancers are found when they are localized, meaning they have not spread beyond the breast. The five-year survival rate is about 99 percent. Locally advanced breast cancer: If the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, this is known as locally advanced cancer. The five-year survival rate is about 85 percent. Metastatic cancer: If the cancer has spread further to other parts of the body, it is known as metastatic cancer. The five-year survival rate is about 27 percent. The overall five-year survival rate for breast cancer is about 90 percent. Good to know: Survival rates do not predict what will happen to someone. Treatment and responses to treatment vary greatly.",
    "faqs": "Q: Does abortion increase the risk of breast cancer? A: No. There is no evidence for a causal relationship between breast cancer and abortion. Early studies of the relationship between prior-induced abortion and breast cancer risk claimed to show a link, but were methodologically flawed. For instance, one such study relied upon people volunteering the information that they had once had an abortion. A key methodological consideration in interpreting the evidence for any relationship between abortion and breast cancer risk is the sensitive nature of abortion, which means, for example, people may be too embarrassed or unwilling to disclose that they had once had an abortion. This could affect the accuracy in retrospective studies that rely on this sensitive information being shared. 25 Another study did not take into account the role of socioeconomic status as a variable which could distort the true relationship between abortion and breast cancer: women from higher socioeconomic classes have more breast cancer incidences in general, likely due to factors such as higher hormonal contraceptive use and bearing fewer children and are also believed to have a greater preference for abortion when pregnant. 26 More rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk. Q: Is breast cancer painful? A: Breast pain is not commonly an early sign of breast cancer. However, there are some rare types of breast cancer that can commonly cause pain as one of the first symptoms. This includes inflammatory breast cancer, in which pain or tenderness is often one of the first symptoms, followed by reddening and dimpling of the skin, as well as Paget’s disease of the nipple, which can cause pain and burning as an early symptom. Most breast pain is due to normal changes in the breast resulting from changes in hormone levels. Some women have non-cancerous lumpy breast tissue called fibrocystic breasts , which may be more painful during certain times of the month. Certain medications can also cause breast pain. If a person experiences breast pain along with any other symptoms of breast cancer, as listed in the symptoms section above, they should contact their doctor. Breast cancer is more likely to cause pain in more advanced stages, either if the tumor pushes into nearby healthy tissue or if the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, where it may cause pain. Pain can be a side effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatment for breast cancer. For more information, see the resource on chemotherapy side effects . Q: Is there a breast cancer cure? A: There are many very good breast cancer treatments, which can often cure breast cancer. Treatment outcomes have also improved now that many are diagnosed at an early stage, due to mammogram screenings. Once breast cancer has spread, it becomes more difficult to cure. Certain types of breast cancer are more likely to be cured, such as infiltrative ductal carcinoma, the most common type of breast cancer, which is limited to the milk duct region and can almost always be cured if found before it has spread. Infiltrative lobular carcinoma is harder to cure as it often affects both breasts. 27 Hormone receptor-positive cancer has a better prognosis than triple negative cancer (see types of breast cancer). Q: Is breast cancer hereditary? A: Most breast cancers are not caused by inherited genetic factors. However, some people may inherit an increased risk of breast cancer. Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which produce tumor suppressor proteins, can  increase a person’s chance of developing breast cancer. These genes can be inherited from either the mother or the father. Not all people who inherit such mutated genes will develop cancer. 28 Q: What bras should I wear after breast cancer treatment? A: After surgery and radiotherapy for breast cancer, it can take up to a year for the area to recover. During this time, a person can get bras to make them more comfortable and which may include any of the following features: No underwiring: Underwires can be uncomfortable. Fits on the loosest hook: There may be swelling after surgery. A bra that initially fits on the loosest hook can gradually be tightened as the swelling goes down. High cotton content: Cotton is gentler on the skin and helps with staying cool if a person is experiencing hot flushes as a treatment side effect. Bra strap cushions: These may make the straps more comfortable and secure. Breast shape and size may change during and after treatment, so it’s a good idea to have one’s bra size measured before buying any new bras. Many lingerie shops have experienced bra fitters, who may have specialist training in helping women who have had, or are going to have, breast surgery. Mastectomy bras for women who have had their breast(s) removed are available from specialist suppliers. Breast prosthesis may also be worn to replace all or part of a breast that has been removed. This is an artificial breast form that fits in a bra cup. If a person has not had an immediate reconstruction, in many cases, a temporary breast prosthesis will be provided after surgery. 29"

    "what_is_burnout": "Burnout is a state of ongoing mental, emotional and physical exhaustion which occurs as a result of overwhelming demands, chronic stress or job dissatisfaction. Although it is not illness on its own, it is recognized as being a stepping stone to more severe physical and mental conditions. With burnout, people may feel worn out everyday, cynical, unenthusiastic, and find reduced satisfaction from their job. Burnout can be accompanied by physical symptoms such as headaches , nausea, and sleeping difficulties. It is important to recognize and treat burnout early, and with psychological counseling and support, most people begin to feel better and recover quickly.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of burnout can be both physical and emotional. Physical symptoms include headache or back pain, disturbed sleep, nausea, tense muscles and tiredness. Emotionally, people with burnout feel irritable, tense, and unmotivated. They may also feel indifferent (not care about things) and cynical, and may socially distance themselves from others. Affected people may lose confidence in their work, feel unproductive and overloaded. Find out more about the Signs of Burnout »",
    "burnout_risks": "In most cases, burnout is work-related. However, other factors can contribute to the situation, such as demanding tasks and activities outside of work, certain personality traits (such as perfectionism), and a stressful lifestyle. Burnout can affect anyone, but tends to commonly affect people in jobs which are physically and emotionally stressful (such as nurses, doctors, police, social workers, etc.) or people going through or supporting a loved one through a stressful life event.",
    "diagnosis": "A diagnosis of burnout is made by a doctor. The medical definition of burnout differs from the common usage. But a early diagnosis may help a person more quickly regain a healthy work-life balance.",
    "treating_burnout": "There is not a single method for treating burnout, but affected people may cope better with stress by adjusting their attitude (rediscovering enjoyable aspects of work, reevaluating priorities and goals), resting (taking short breaks throughout the day, sleeping more), and taking time to recharge themselves outside of work (spending time doing enjoyable things outside of work, seeking support from family and friends, exercising, etc.).",
    "prevention": "Since burnout usually develops over a long period of time, attention to tell-tale signs, like feeling constantly overloaded at work, may help with prevention. Affected people may find that working within their abilities, developing healthy habits (e.g. regular meal times and exercise), and finding strategies to counter stress may help with prevention. Preventing burnout is sometimes an ongoing process, so finding reliable sources of emotional support is important."

    "condition": "Candida Vulvovaginitis (vaginal thrush)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/candida-vulvovaginitis/",
    "what_is_vaginal_thrush_candida_vulvovaginitis": "Candida vulvovaginitis , also known as vaginal thrush, vaginal yeast infection and vaginal candidiasis, is a common infection of the vulva and vagina. The condition occurs when Candida, a naturally occurring fungus, overgrows and causes symptoms such as vaginal itchiness and irritation, pain during sexual intercouse and vaginal discharge. 1\n\nAn estimated 75 percent of women will experience vaginal thrush in their lifetime, with a further 40-45 percent experiencing recurrent episodes. 2 Most often, the condition is caused by changes in the environment of the vagina and gastrointestinal tract, which may be triggered by factors such as the use of certain medications or contraceptive devices, pregnancy and conditions including diabetes and HIV. 1 Vaginal thrush can be unpleasant and cause significant distress, but can often be effectively managed with treatment. This will usually involve the use of antifungal medications or skin creams. 3",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The most common symptoms of candida vulvovaginitis, or vaginal thrush, include: 1 4 An itching and/or burning sensation around the vulva and vaginal opening Pain during sexual intercourse Pain when urinating Soreness, redness, and swelling of the vulva Vaginal discharge, which can range from watery to thick and chunky",
    "what_causes_vaginal_thrush": "Vaginal thrush is a naturally occurring group of fungi found in the gastrointestinal tract and, less often, the vagina, mouth and on the skin. 4 Normally, Candida is present in small amounts and causes no symptoms. Thrush occurs when the balance of microorganisms and, consequently, the pH levels in the vagina, are disrupted and Candida multiplies, causing the symptoms described above. This overgrowth of Candida is typically triggered by changes in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and vagina.\n\nChanges in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and vagina can occur as a result of a variety of factors, including: 1 Antibiotics: Typically, antibiotics work by killing bacteria, including those present in the vagina. This can upset the balance of bacteria in the vagina and cause an overgrowth of Candida. Contraceptives: The use of hormonal contraceptives containing estrogen, including the birth control pill, can make candida vulvovaginitis more likely. This is also true of contraceptive devices, such as vaginal sponges, diaphragms and IUDs, though not typically the use of spermicides. Pregnancy: Being pregnant can make candida vulvovaginitis more likely. Treating the condition in pregnant people requires a different approach to what is usual, but poses little risk to the baby. 5 Weakened immune system: People with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop candida vulvovaginitis. A weakened immune system can occur as a result of conditions such as HIV, as well as the use of medications, including those associated with chemotherapy , steroids and those often prescribed following an organ transplant. Diabetes: People with diabetes stand a higher chance of developing candida vulvovaginitis, especially if it is poorly managed. Read more about Diabetes » Sexual activity: Candida vulvovaginitis is more likely in women who are sexually active. The condition is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but can, in some cases, be passed on to sexual partners of both sexes. Age : Candida vulvovaginitis is more likely in post-pubescent and premenopausal women.",
    "how_to_diagnose_vaginal_thrush": "Women experiencing any possible symptoms of vaginal thrush should consult a doctor for evaluation. The symptoms of the condition are similar to those of a number of others, including bacterial vaginosis , dermatitis and trichomonas vulvovaginitis , making proper diagnosis an important step towards receiving effective treatment. 1 In addition to visiting a doctor, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment. A diagnosis can usually be confirmed following an examination by a doctor. The affected person may also be asked about their medical history and whether they have had the condition before.\n\nVaginal thrush becomes recurrent if it is experienced four or more time per year. Roughly five to eight percent of women will develop the recurrent form of the condition. 1 As with women experiencing symptoms for the first time, when symptoms occur, women who have already had the condition should consult a doctor, when symptoms occur, rather than attempting to self-diagnose. According to one study, only 11 percent of people who self-diagnose candida vulvovaginitis do so accurately. 6 In addition to an examination and a discussion of the affected person’s medical history, those experiencing recurrent bouts of candida vulvovaginitis are likely to have a swab sample taken from their vagina. Recurrent episodes may be due to the presence of a less common type of the Candida fungus, one that is resistant to the types of medication that are typically prescribed. 1 By examining the vaginal discharge in a lab, doctors will be able to identify whether or not this is the case.",
    "vaginal_thrush_treatments": "Treatment will typically involve the use of antifungal medication, which will usually take the form of an oral tablet and/or topical skin cream. Following treatment, most cases of thrush will resolve in a few days. If symptoms do not disappear in this timeframe, a doctor should be consulted.\n\nTwo of the most commonly prescribed antifungal tablets are: Fluconazole Itraconazole Fluconazole is usually available over the counter without a prescription. Side-effects are uncommon but can include headaches , diarrhea and a rash. 1 3 Itraconazole is typically reserved for severe cases and is generally only available with a prescription from a doctor. 7 Possible side-effects include: 8 Diarrhea Headaches\n\nAlthough oral medication can be more convenient, women affected by soreness or itchiness around the vagina may find that antifungal skin creams provide more immediate relief. 3 Over-the-counter and prescription varieties are available, with most requiring only a single dose to relieve symptoms. 7 This is usually carried out using an applicator in order to allow the cream to reach the inside of the vagina, although some may also wish to apply a small amount to the skin surrounding the vagina. Side-effects, including skin irritation and itchiness, are possible but uncommon. 3\n\nRecurrent infections are usually treated using the same methods as a single bout, but for longer periods of time. For skin creams, this is usually around two weeks, though the doctor will advise on exactly how long to continue use. After this period, a method known as maintenance treatment may be employed. This involves taking one dose of the tablet or skin cream every week, usually for around six months. For most women, maintenance treatment is effective in preventing candida vulvovaginitis recurring. 9\n\nPregnant women should always consult a doctor before beginning treatment for vaginal thrush during pregnancy. Common medications used to treat the condition, including fluconazole, are not appropriate for use during pregnancy. Instead, a doctor will prescribe a pregnancy-appropriate antifungal medication. 5 Vaginal thrush is common in pregnant women due to the bodily changes pregnancy triggers. It should not be considered cause for serious alarm.\n\nAlthough there is a small chance of passing candida vulvovaginitis to a sexual partner, the condition is not a sexually transmitted infection and does not usually require the sexual partners of affected people to seek treatment. 1",
    "how_to_prevent_vaginal_yeast_infection": "There are a number of practices and habits that are thought to help prevent vaginal thrush. It should be noted, however, that these practices are not medically proven to be effective and may only be useful in some cases. Preventive methods include: 7 Maintaining good hygiene: Washing the vagina with scented soaps, spermicides and other, similar products may help to alter the environmental conditions of the vagina, in turn helping Candida to thrive. Some women may find it beneficial, therefore, to wash using only water and unscented soaps. Wearing loose clothing: Some women may find that wearing loose-fitting, airy clothing around their lower body is beneficial in helping to prevent candida vulvovaginitis. It is thought that the warm and moist conditions created by tight clothing can help Candida to grow. Avoiding friction during sexual activity: While candida vulvovaginitis is not a sexually transmitted infection, it is thought that friction during sexual intercourse can make it more likely. Consequently, ensuring that the vagina is well lubricated may help to prevent the condition.",

    "vaginal_thrush_faqs": "Q: Is candida vulvovaginitis contagious? A: In the majority of cases, candida vulvovaginitis is not contagious. However, in rare instances, the infection can be transferred between sexual partners, both male and female. 10 Q: Is candida vulvovaginitis a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? A: No, candida vulvovaginitis is not classed as a sexually transmitted infection. This is despite the fact that, in rare cases, the infection can be passed between sexual partners. It is generally not necessary for the sexual partners of people with the condition to receive treatment themselves. 1 Q: Can men get candida vulvovaginitis? A: Yes, men can contract the same infection as that involved in candida vulvovaginitis, although in cases such as these, the condition is referred to as thrush in men, or male candidiasis. This is rare, but usually the result of having unprotected sexual intercourse with a person already affected by the condition. Symptoms of thrush in men include: 11 A burning sensation, redness and irritation around the head of the penis and behind the foreskin Discharge from the penis, which is usually white with a thick or chunky texture A bad smell from the penis Men experiencing possible symptoms of thrush should see a doctor for evaluation.

    "condition": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/",
    "what_is_carpal_tunnel_syndrome_cts": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a painful medical condition in which the median nerve in the wrist becomes compressed inside the carpal tunnel. 1 The median nerve is a nerve which passes through the arm to the hand, on each side of the body and which controls sensation and movement in the hand. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist on the palm side of the hand, made up of bones and ligaments. The median nerve is the only nerve in the body which passes through the carpal tunnel. When direct pressure is exerted on a nerve, as in CTS, this is, in medical terms, referred to  as an entrapment neuropathy. CTS is the most common type of entrapment neuropathy. 2 When the nerve becomes entrapped, this causes symptoms including pain, tingling, numbness and hot-and-cold sensations. The hand may become difficult to move. The symptoms of CTS are often worst at night and absent during the day. In most cases, the exact cause of CTS is unknown, but it usually develops in adulthood and is often attributed to work-related activities such as typing and other repetitive movements, such as mopping, sweeping or using vibrating tools. The risk of CTS is increased in people experiencing arthritis, thyroid conditions and pregnancy. Around 60 percent of people affected by CTS experience the condition in both wrists (bilateral CTS). CTS which only affects one wrist is called unilateral CTS. In both bilateral and unilateral CTS, the dominant hand is usually first and/or more strongly, affected. 3 CTS  caused by pregnancy often goes away on its own when the pregnancy concludes. Likewise, CTS that is caused by a medical condition usually goes away on its own when the condition is managed effectively. To treat CTS, some people may find it helpful to wear a wrist splint at night to hold the wrist in a still position and use OTC or prescription medications to manage the pain and inflammation of CTS. For others, surgery may be necessary to alleviate the condition.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of CTS are usually worse at night and may be absent during the day. They can be intensified or brought on by forceful activities involving the wrist, especially the use of vibrating tools and heavy lifting. The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are: 4 Numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the radial half of the ring finger (the half of the ring finger closest to the palm, which is supplied by the median nerve). This can result in atrophy of the affected muscles (which may appear flattened). Burning pain in the wrist Loss of grip strength and dexterity Proximal radiation (the sensation that the pain has radiated to nearby areas) is a less common, but not unusual, symptom of CTS. People may experience pain related to CTS in other parts of the arm, namely: The volar forearm; the side of the forearm that is on the same side as the palm of the hand The medial arm; the skin on the side of the arm where the medial brachial cutaneous nerve is The shoulder The symptoms of CTS worsen the longer the condition is left untreated. If a person is affected by CTS for several months, they may begin to feel numbness in the hand on a permanent basis and lose the ability to feel hot and cold sensations with the hand. Seek medical attention promptly if any of the symptoms of CTS are present, in order to diagnose and begin treating the condition  at an early stage.\n\nAcute carpal tunnel syndrome is a version of CTS in which the median nerve is severely crushed, usually as the result of an injury or chronic health condition. Unlike regular CTS, acute CTS requires urgent surgical intervention to prevent serious health consequences, such as the permanent loss of sensation or movement in the affected area. 5 Factors which are associated with the development of acute CTS include: 5 Fractures and fracture dislocations around the wrist Vascular disorders (diseases affecting the blood vessels) Hemorrhagic conditions (conditions relating to abnormal blood flow or clotting) Rheumatologic disorders (conditions relating to pain and stiffness in the body, such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease ) Anomalous anatomy (atypical wrist or nerve structure)",
    "causes": "Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by the median nerve (the nerve which controls sensation and movement in the hands) becoming compressed. Any medical conditions and/or injuries which cause swelling in the wrist can reduce the amount of space inside the carpal tunnel, causing pressure to be exerted on the median nerve and activating the symptoms of CTS. The biological cause of CTS within the carpal tunnel is the swelling of a protective lining of tendons called the tenosynovium. This sets off a chain of related changes within the carpal tunnel: 6 The swelling of the tendons is understood to cause a buildup of synovial fluid; the fluid which normally protects and lubricates the tendons; within the carpal tunnel. In reaction to this buildup of fluid, a band across the top of the carpal tunnel called the transverse ligament becomes thicker and broader. The swelling and the enlarged transverse ligament exert pressure on the median nerve, depriving it of the blood supply and oxygen it needs in order to function normally. This causes the median nerve to become damaged and the symptoms of CTS to develop. The medical or circumstantial basis for these developments occurring in the carpal tunnel is unknown in many cases, and there is no test available to identify a specific cause. However, the development of CTS may be caused by factors including: 1\n\nIn particular, CTS may be attributed to activities which involve repetitive movements, heavy lifting and using vibrating tools. Professional activities which are particularly associated with CTS include assembly work, farming, sewing, cleaning, and meat packing.\n\nPeople born with smaller bone structures are more likely to have wrist and bone structures in which the median nerve is susceptible to the compression that causes CTS. A genetic predisposition to any of the many medical conditions which are linked to CTS may be described as the indirect cause of CTS in a person who develops CTS as a result of another medical condition. 7\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders (conditions affecting the muscles and/or skeleton) and autoimmune diseases may trigger the development of CTS by causing inflammation in the hands and wrists. The main medical conditions which are linked to CTS are diseases of the thyroid gland, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney insufficiency, Down syndrome, osteoarthritis and obesity. If CTS is caused by a medical condition, it may be alleviated by effectively treating the causal condition. 6 Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nPregnant women sometimes develop CTS due to hormonal changes and fluid retention. If CTS is caused by pregnancy alone, it will often go away when the pregnancy ends. Rest, ice, elevation and exercise may all help to alleviate the symptoms of CTS during pregnancy. 8\n\nThe use of some medications has been linked to CTS, but more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which these may cause CTS to develop. Medications which have been linked to CTS include: 6 Medications which affect the immune system (such as interleukin-2) Medications which prevent blood clotting (such as warfarin)",
    "risk_factors": "Certain risk factors increase a person’s likelihood of developing CTS. These include occupational factors such as working in a role that necessitates intensive and/or repetitive use of one’s hands, and non-occupational factors, such as medical conditions like diabetes and hypothyroidism which may cause CTS. Risk factors for CTS include: 2\n\nCTS is a common complication of pregnancy, due to fluid retention, edema and hormonal changes within the body. One’s likelihood of developing CTS in pregnancy, and the severity of the condition, increases with age. Most people who develop CTS during pregnancy find that it alleviates on its own when the pregnancy concludes. Read more about Pregnancy »\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, women are three times more likely than men to develop CTS. 1\n\nThe hormonal changes that accompany menopause can cause a buildup of fluid in the body, increasing the risk of developing CTS. Women, whose hormone levels alter excessively during pregnancy, are more likely to develop CTS in later life, after undergoing menopause, than those whose hormonal changes during pregnancy are within the normal range. 9\n\nCTS is a common complication of arthritis, due to the swelling of joints and tendons associated with the condition. 10\n\nThe likelihood of developing CTS increases with age, particularly after 70. In part, this is due to the fact that most musculoskeletal disorders predominantly affect older people, and CTS is a common consequence of these conditions. 11\n\nBetween 15 and 20 percent of people with diabetes will develop CTS, which is believed to be due to having high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is often linked to the development of problems with the nerves, such as diabetic neuropathy. In people with diabetes, when blood sugar levels are high, glucose is believed to attach to the tendons. This causes compression within the carpal tunnel as the tendons enlarge, resulting in CTS. 12 Read more about Diabetes »\n\nPeople with improperly-managed thyroid conditions may retain excess fluid in their connective tissues. This contributes to inflammation within the wrist, which can cause CTS, especially if left untreated. Hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) is particularly linked to CTS, but people with hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) are also more likely to develop CTS than the general population. 13 Read more about Hypothyroidism » Read more about Hyperthyroidusm »\n\nPeople with a sibling or parent with CTS are more likely to be affected than those without. A person’s bone structure and overall size is largely determined by their genetic makeup, and those with smaller frames have less space in their carpal tunnels, which significantly increases the likelihood of the median nerve becoming trapped and their developing CTS. 7\n\nA link has been found between the use of tobacco and developing CTS. Tobacco products negatively affects the body’s immune system and increases a person’s risk of developing inflammatory diseases which can cause a buildup of fluid in the carpal tunnel, which may result in CTS. 14\n\nIt is possible for the median nerve to become compressed due to changes in the structure of the bones and muscles in the wrist that result from injuries. People who play a lot of sports are particularly at risk of hand and wrist injuries that can result in CTS. In injury-related CTS, ensuring that the injury heals properly and that the median nerve ceases to be entrapped will alleviate the condition. 15\n\nCTS is often linked to activities involving repetitive hand and wrist movements, in particular, the use of vibrating tools.",
    "diagnosis": "To diagnose CTS, a doctor will usually perform a physical exam on the hand(s) and wrist(s) and ask about the symptoms a person has been experiencing. The purpose of the physical exam is to find out whether a person is experiencing physical sensations that typically relate to the median nerve being compressed. If these sensations are not present, this can rule out a diagnosis of CTS and the possibility that a person is affected by another condition can be investigated. During the physical exam, doctors look out for: Weak muscles surrounding the thumb (which can happen in cases of CTS due to underusing these muscles in order to avoid the pain that often accompanies movement) Tinel’s sign which involves tingling and numbness in the fingers when the wrist is tapped at the palm side of the hand (this alone is insufficient for a CTS diagnosis, as it is also a possible symptom of many other conditions) A positive Phalen’s maneuver which invilves pain, numbness or tingling in the wrist and fingers when the wrist is flexed to the hand’s maximum ability\n\nFurther testing is usually needed, even if all of these symptoms are present, in order to confirm a diagnosis of CTS. This may involve:\n\nDamaged nerves cannot transmit signals to the body parts in order to bring about certain actions as quickly as healthy nerves can. Nerve damage is a common result of CTS. To detect it, the doctor will attach electrodes to the hand and wrist to stimulate the nerves in the fingers and wrist with an electric current. The speed with which the signal can travel through the nerves will be indicative of the extent of any nerve damage, and can support or discredit a diagnosis of CTS. This test usually takes around 10 minutes to perform, and can be moderately uncomfortable because it produces an unfamiliar tapping/tingling sensation.\n\nDoctors may perform an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in order to visualize the median nerve and carpal tunnel and determine their exact positions and the extent of the nerve entrapment.\n\nTo rule out other conditions which also have symptoms of pain, numbness and tingling in the hand/wrist, including diabetes, diseases of the thyroid and arthritis, doctors may perform a blood test.\n\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is frequently misdiagnosed due to the fact that it shares symptoms with several other conditions, including arthritis, wrist tendonitis, repetitive strain injury (RSI) and thoracic outlet syndrome. Symptoms which CTS shares with other conditions include: Tingling Pain Numbness Hot-and-cold sensations Difficulty grasping or using one’s hand It is important to be aware of the key differences between CTS and some other conditions which share its symptoms, in order to avoid a misdiagnosis. Other conditions which are commonly misdiagnosed as CTS include:\n\nArthritis can affect all the fingers in the hand, whereas CTS cannot affect the little (pinky) finger. Whereas CTS is worse at night, arthritis is not affected by the time of day. The symptoms of CTS can be absent and then suddenly become triggered by a particular activity, whereas the pain associated with arthritis is usually constantly present but alters in intensity during activities which put strain on the hands and wrists. 16 Read more about Arthritis »\n\nConditions such as spinal disc herniation (a slipped disc) and cervical stenosis (a condition characterised by weakness and numbness that may affect areas including the spine, neck, shoulders, hands, arms and legs) can cause nerve compression that may result in similar sensations to those of CTS.\n\nIn wrist tendonitis , the area affected by symptoms may be different to that of CTS. The pain, numbness and tingling may affect the tendons in any part of the hand or wrist, whereas in CTS the symptoms are limited to the thumb, index and middle fingers, the palm side of the wrist and the radial half of the ring finger.\n\nIn thoracic outlet syndrome, blood vessels or nerves in the space between the collarbone and the first rib become compressed. The pain can affect the shoulders and neck, as well as the fingers. The fingers which are usually affected are the little (pinky) finger and the non-radial half of the ring finger. These are the two areas that cannot be affected by the symptoms of CTS. 17\n\nThis is a general term to describe symptoms including pain, throbbing and stiffness in the muscles and tendons as a result of overuse and repetitive movements. 18 Repetitive strain injury can occur anywhere in the body, but most often affects the neck, shoulders, forearms, elbows, hands and wrists. When it occurs in the hand and wrists, RSI may be mistaken for CTS, but unlike CTS, RSI is capable of affecting any part of the overall area.",
    "treatment": "Carpal tunnel syndrome may disappear on its own without treatment. If CTS is caused by another condition such as arthritis or an underactive thyroid, its symptoms may alleviate on their own when the causal condition is treated. If one’s carpal tunnel syndrome is not caused by another treatable medical condition, it is best to begin treatment as soon as possible to prevent the symptoms worsening and to reduce the level of damage to the median nerve associated with continuous pressure. For those with mild symptoms, and/or who have been affected for a short time, non-surgical treatments such as wrist splinting and medications may be sufficient. In more severe cases, or where the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be alleviated by non-surgical means, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve may be recommended. In pregnant women, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome often abate in the weeks after the pregnancy ends, with no need for treatment. Those who are still experiencing symptoms of CTS three months after the conclusion of the pregnancy should seek medical attention to devise a treatment plan. 19\n\nWrist splinting is a common first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS. It involves wearing a splint at night for a few weeks in order to hold the joint in a neutral position. This helps to prevent the symptoms of CTS from developing overnight, when the pain is usually worse. Wrist splints come in many different shapes and sizes and a doctor can recommend a suitable one. A wrist splint works by preventing the hand from bending in way which brings on the symptoms of CTS during the night. However, because the wrist is kept in a fixed position by the splint, it is important to exercise the hand and wrist during the day to prevent the muscles from weakening due to underuse. The effects of wrist splinting usually become noticeable after a few weeks of wearing the splint. In some cases, this is a sufficient treatment for CTS and symptoms will disappear. However, for many people, splinting is a temporary solution rather than an effective treatment for CTS, and symptoms may return. In this case, other treatment options such as medications or surgery may be recommended. 20\n\nMedications that are prescribed in the management of CTS can provide temporary relief from the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. The medications most commonly prescribed for CTS are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and, in more severe cases of CTS, corticosteroids, which are taken as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel. NSAIDs are available as over-the-counter or prescription medication, and can temporarily minimize joint and muscle pain. Naproxen and ibuprofen are the NSAIDs most commonly used for pain management in CTS. Long-term use of NSAIDs carries multiple health risks, including impaired gastroenteric function and increased likelihood of peptic ulcer disease. NSAIDs should be taken for a limited period of time only, in consultation with a medical professional. Corticosteroids can be taken orally as tablets or injected into the carpal tunnel. Local injections are considered to be more effective than oral corticosteroids at reducing the pain and inflammation associated with CTS. Corticosteroids may be prescribed in cases of severe CTS, and/or when wrist splinting has not provided long-term relief. 21 Short-term use of corticosteroids (for example, for a few weeks or a month) is associated with a variety of side effects, including stomach problems, skin problems and weight gain, which may render them an unsuitable treatment option for some people. Continuous (longer-term) use of corticosteroids is never recommended for the treatment of CTS as it is associated with increased risk of the development or worsening of a variety of health conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis. Medications help manage the painful symptoms of CTS, rather than treating the cause. Neither NSAIDs nor corticosteroids can relieve the pressure on the median nerve and these medications can therefore only provide temporary relief from the symptoms of CTS. Medications should be used as part of a wider treatment strategy which focuses on releasing the entrapped median nerve.\n\nSurgery for CTS will not usually be considered as a first-line treatment, and is usually recommended only when CTS is at a late stage and/or has not been alleviated by non-surgical treatments. Urgent surgery for CTS is usually only needed as a treatment for acute CTS. Surgery for CTS involves cutting a part of the carpal tunnel in order to reduce pressure on the median nerve. The part of the carpal tunnel which is cut during surgery is known as the flexor retinaculum. There are two possible surgical procedures for CTS: endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release. 22 Both types of surgery can be performed as an outpatient procedure and usually only require a local anesthetic to numb the hand or arm. Endoscopic carpal tunnel release involves making a small incision in the palm and/or the wrist, and a small camera called an endoscope is inserted into one of the incisions to monitor the procedure. The flexor retinaculum is then cut with an instrument inserted into the second incision. It is also possible to perform the procedure by making only one incision in the wrist, and inserting both the surgical instrument and the endoscope into the same incision. Open carpal tunnel release involves cuting the inside of the wrist to reveal the carpal tunnel. The surgeon will then cut through the flexor retinaculum. The recovery time may be slightly shorter for an endoscopic procedure, but most people can return to work less than three weeks after either procedure. 23\n\nIf a person is diagnosed with CTS, they can help to prevent the condition getting worse by making certain adaptations to their lifestyle. The two principal lifestyle changes which are recommended for people who have been diagnosed with CTS are:\n\nThere are many possible hand exercises that can be incorporated into a person’s daily routine in order to ease the pain associated with CTS and prevent future injuries. 24 When a person is diagnosed with CTS, doctors will be able to recommend and demonstrate exercises, and provide guidelines on how often these should be carried out.\n\nCTS can be aggravated by overuse of the hands and wrists, in particular through repetitive activities such as working in an assembly line or using vibrating tools. People with CTS whose work involves activities that may increase their symptoms are often advised to stay home when they are undergoing treatment to ensure its effectiveness. Wearing a wrist splint at night can help to reduce strain. 20",
    "prevention": "It is not always possible to prevent CTS, particularly if it is caused by pregnancy or another health condition. However, there are some lifestyle changes that people can make to reduce the likelihood of developing CTS. These preventative measures are particularly recommended for people whose daily activities are associated with a higher risk of CTS. Preventative measures against developing CTS include: Ensuring that any other health conditions a person may have that could contribute to developing CTS (such as diabetes are treated or managed effectively Maintaining a healthy weight, diet and exercise regime Avoiding the use of tobacco products, which weaken the immune system and increases the likelihood of developing inflammatory conditions that can cause CTS Regularly assessing one’s day-to-day routine in order to minimize activities involving repetitive or intense movements that might contribute to an increased risk of CTS Following ergonomic guidelines (recommendations on how to position and use equipment for efficiency and comfort) at home and at work, in order to ensure that all activities are carried out in the most comfortable, appropriate way for the body Taking regular breaks from any activities that contribute to CTS, especially when using vibrating tools, in order to reduce the impact of activities which put pressure on the wrists and hands",
    "carpal_tunnel_syndrome_faqs": "Q: Does typing cause CTS? A: Typing is associated with an increased likelihood of developing repetitive strain injury (RSI). If RSI affects the tendons or ligaments in the carpal tunnel, this can cause compression on the median nerve and the development of CTS. However, research has shown that there is at most a very small direct link between computer work and CTS. Activities which involve using the hands and wrists with a greater intensity, such as using vibrating tools, are significantly more likely to cause CTS than typing. The use of ergonomic computer keyboards is, however, sometimes recommended as a preventative measure against developing CTS. 20 Q: Can children be affected by CTS? A: CTS in children is rare. When it develops, it is most commonly related to having a genetically inherited condition associated with inflammation, such as lysosomal storage disease, which can cause swelling in the joints and pressure to build up in the carpal tunnel. The symptoms of CTS and its treatment options are the same for children as for adults. 25 If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be affected by CTS, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app ."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cataracts/",
    "what_are_cataracts": "A cataract is a clouding of the eye’s lens which leads to a decrease in vision and, in some cases, possible blindness . The condition occurs when protein clumps in one or both eyes prevent the retina from receiving clear images. 1 Cataracts generally affect older people , but can also be present from birth, be brought about by exposure to radiation or trauma, as well as through complications from surgery. 2 Cataracts are among the main causes of blindness globally and are one of the most common reasons for loss of vision in people over 40. 3 Cataracts can be treated through surgery, and steps can be taken to help prevent the onset of the disorder.",
    "what_are_the_types": "There are several types of cataracts , each classified by how and where they develop in the eye: 4 Nuclear cataracts form in the center (nucleus) of the lens and typically cause the eye to become brown or yellow. They are normally associated with aging. Posterior capsular cataracts affect the back of the eye and typically form very quickly. Cortical cataracts form in the lens cortex which surrounds the nucleus. They are white and wedge-shaped opacities. Congenital cataracts are a rare form that develops in childhood or are present at birth. Radiation cataracts are brought about by exposure to radiation, typically as a result of cancer treatment. Traumatic cataracts are brought about by damage to the eyes and can sometimes develop some time after the initial trauma. Secondary cataracts are a result of medications or disease. These include the steroid prednisone, diabetes, and glaucoma.",
    "symptoms": "Cataracts typically develop slowly , meaning the symptoms may be difficult to detect or confused with normal signs of aging. The symptoms include: Blurred, clouded, or dimmed vision Sensitivity to light and glare, particularly at night Objects appear yellow-tinged or faded in color Halos appearing around lights Changes in glasses prescription Occasionally, when cataracts first develop, it can lead to an improvement in nearsightedness. This phenomenon is known as “ second sight ” and is a temporary occurrence that will disappear as the condition develops. 5",
    "what_causes_cataracts": "The lens of the eye filters light onto the retina, allowing for clear and focussed vision. Largely, it is made from water and proteins. Cataracts are brought about when these proteins begin to clump in the lens, leading to blurred, faded and cloudy vision that can worsen over time. This clumping is commonly a result of aging, yet it is not clear why some people and not others are affected. There are, however, some factors that may increase an individual’s chances of developing cataracts , including: 6 Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, from sunlight or radiation therapy Diabetes Eye conditions such as uveitis and glaucoma Eye injury or surgery Use of corticosteroids A family history of cataracts Other factors that are also thought to be linked to the development of cataracts include: Smoking Alcohol The abuse of illicit substances Vitamin deficiency. This includes vitamin D deficiency , vitamin K deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency .",
    "how_do_you_know_if_you_have_cataracts": "Cataracts are diagnosed through a full eye examination carried out by an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Those experiencing problems with their sight should visit an eye care professional as soon as possible. Moreover, people over 40 should undergo an eye test at least once every two years. 7",
    "cataracts_treatment": "If the symptoms of cataracts are mild, an altered prescription, e.g., for different glasses or contact lenses, may be effective in correcting an individual’s vision. However, it is typical for cataracts to worsen over time . If this happens, it is likely that surgery will be necessary . 8 Cataract surgery is a common procedure and is usually carried out under local anaesthetic. Most people who undergo cataract surgery will see a significant improvement in their vision, with 9 out of 10 people achieving between 20/20 and 20/40 vision afterward. However, most surgeons will focus on correcting long-distance sight, meaning glasses may still be needed to see things close at hand.\n\nThis is usually measured using the Snellen visual acuity system : The top number of the fraction refers to the viewing distance between the patient and the eye chart. The bottom number of the fraction refers to the distance at which a person with ideal vision would be able to see the figures on the eye chart clearly. A person with 20/40 vision can therefore see figures on the eye chart clearly at a distance of 20 feet, whereas a person with ideal vision could see the same figures clearly, from a distance of 40 feet away from the eye chart. In the United States, the distance at which visual acuity is measured is typically 20 feet. In other countries, this distance is generally six meters, and a person’s visual acuity may therefore be expressed as a fraction of six.\n\nThe risk of complications during and after cataract surgery is small. The most common complication is posterior capsule opacification (PCO) brought about when skin or membrane grows over the implanted lens, resulting in a return of clouded or impaired vision. PCO can be corrected with laser surgery. 1 8 There are other risks that are far less common. Risks during the operation include: Tearing of the lens Inability to remove the cataracts Bleeding of the eye Accidental damage to other areas of the eye Risks following the operation include: Inflammation of the eye Retina swelling Cornea swelling Retinal detachment Infection If complications become apparent after surgery, a doctor should be contacted as soon as possible. In most cases, complications can be rectified with treatment or further surgery.",
    "how_to_prevent_cataracts": "Although there is no guaranteed way to prevent cataracts, there are some preventative measures that can be undertaken to reduce the risk. They include: 9 Having your eyes checked regularly Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins Quitting or cutting down on smoking Reducing your alcohol intake Avoiding prolonged use of corticosteroids",
    "cataracts_faqs": "Q: Is cataract extraction possible? A: Yes, cataract extraction is carried out through surgery. The procedure is considered routine and is a success in most cases, leading to between 20/20 and 20/40 vision. 10 Q: Do cataracts lead to blindness? A: Cataracts cannot be reversed but it can be treated effectively through surgery. If, however, the condition is left untreated, it can lead to blindness."

    "what_is_cervical_cancer": "Cervical cancer is a cancer of the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (the womb) that opens into the vagina. Cervical cancer is a common cancer in women. Most cervical cancer is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus). This virus causes changes in the cervical cells that may develop into cancer over time. Symptoms may include unusual vaginal discharge, pain during sex and vaginal bleeding after sex, between periods or after the menopause. The treatment may consist of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. If discovered at an early stage it is likely to be cured.",
    "risk_factors_for_cervical_cancer": "Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Most cases are caused by infection with the human papilloma virus ( HPV or wart virus). People who have unprotected sex or who first have sex at an early age are more likely to get HPV and develop cervical cancer. People with a very weak immune system are also at higher risk of cervical cancer. Other things that increase the risk of cervical cancer are smoking and having a relative who has had cervical cancer.",
    "cervical_cancer_symptoms": "Symptoms of cervical cancer include: vaginal discharge vaginal bleeding in between menstruation or after sex pain during sex and pain in the lower part of the belly. Many women with cervical cancer have no symptoms, so screening (testing for the condition in people with no symptoms) is important .",
    "diagnosing_cervical_cancer": "The diagnosis may be based on screening for changes in cervical cells. Women are regularly screened (tested without symptoms) for cervical cancer. The most common test for screening is a Pap smear. This test involves sampling cells from the cervix and looking at them under a microscope. If there are signs that a cancer could be developing, a biopsy (a bigger sample of the cervix) may be needed to identify the type of cancer.",
    "treatment": "If there are cells on the cervix that have a high chance of becoming a cancer over time, these are removed with a procedure called a large loop excision (of the) transformation zone (a LLETZ procedure). Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, cervical cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",
    "preventing_cervical_cancer": "Vaccination against the wart virus helps to prevent most cases of cervical cancer. This is currently given to girls between the ages of 9 and 14 as a part of national immunization programs. Screening (Pap tests) for cervical cancer is also very important because it allows cervical cancer to be detected and treated at an early stage. Using a condom during sexual intercourse helps to avoid the major cause of cervical cancer, the human papilloma virus (HPV or wart virus).",

The inflammation can be infectious, most often caused by bacteria or viruses , or non-infectious, caused by physical or chemical irritation, injury to the cervix or allergies. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia and gonorrhea, are the most common cause of cervicitis. Some women don't experience any symptoms at all as a result of cervicitis, while others may experience symptoms such as vaginal discharge, lower abdominal (stomach) pain or pain and bleeding after sexual activity. Antibiotics or antiviral medications may be necessary to treat infectious cervicitis, however most people recover fully from the condition.",

STIs that may cause cervicitis include: 2 Chlamydia Gonorrhea Genital herpes Trichomoniasis – an infection with a microscopic parasite Less commonly, cervicitis may be caused by factors such as: 3 Bacterial vaginosis , an imbalance of normal bacteria in the vagina An allergy to the chemicals found in condoms, spermicides or douches Injury or irritation caused by things such as diaphragms, tampons or pessaries A hormonal imbalance Cancer or cancer treatment",
    "diagnosing_cervicitis": "Women displaying the symptoms of cervicitis should see a doctor for diagnosis. Doctors will be able to identify the condition, as well as any other conditions that involve similar symptoms. Diagnosing cervicitis will usually involve tests including: 4\n\nIn this test, a device called a speculum is inserted into the vagina. The speculum is gently opened to widen the vagina so that the vagina interior and cervix can be seen. The doctor will be looking for signs of redness, discharge and inflammation of the vaginal walls.\n\nAlso known as a pap test , this exam involves swabbing cells from the vagina and cervix and testing these cells for abnormalities. This can be performed during the speculum exam.\n\nThis test  involves the doctor inserting a gloved finger into the vagina to examine for abnormalities.\n\nSTIs screened for usually include chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and herpes . 5",
    "cervicitis_treatment": "There is no specific treatment for cervicitis. Instead, a doctor will recommend a treatment method based on the root cause of the condition, as well as the affected person’s symptoms, age, overall health and medical history.\n\nIn cases where cervicitis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics will generally be prescribed. A certain kind of antibiotics are also commonly prescribed if an infection with the microscopic parasite trichomonas is suspected or confirmed. Antibiotics should be taken according to the instructions of the doctor, as well as the instruction pamphlet enclosed within the packaging. It is important to take antibiotics for the entirety of the prescribed course, even if the problem clears before this time. If caused by a virus, such as the herpes virus, antiviral medication will normally be prescribed. This medication may be topical, i.e. applied directly to the affected area or administered orally, or both. Treatment should always involve both the affected person and their sexual partner. Without this, the risk of re-infecting each other is very high. Moreover, all sexual activity should be halted until seven days after each partner has completed treatment or as long as specified by the doctor. 6\n\nIf the condition is a result of irritation from condoms or tampons, for example, treatment may involve ceasing to use these products to allow time for healing. If the symptoms of cervicitis are particularly severe or have developed into pelvic inflammatory disease, the person is pregnant or their immune system is weak, the affected person may be admitted to hospital for specialized care and support. 7",
    "cervicitis_in_pregnancy": "Newly pregnant women or those attempting to become pregnant should be screened for cervicitis as soon as possible. When caused by an STI, cervicitis can lead to negative outcomes during pregnancy, including premature labor and miscarriage . 8 People who are sexually active with multiple partners during pregnancy should also be tested after each encounter. Doctors are able to effectively treat cervicitis during pregnancy, but it is important that this treatment is received as early as possible.",
    "prevention": "Using condoms during sexual intercourse can help prevent bacterial and viral infections of the cervix. Condoms, however, cannot guarantee full protection. Avoiding causes of non-infectious cervicitis, such as things which cause allergies, may help prevent some episodes of cervicitis.",
    "complications": "If cervicitis is caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea and it spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes, this can result in a condition known as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Symptoms of PID include abdominal pain and fever, and can in some cases lead to fertility problems. PID can typically be treated using antibiotics. People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to PID should visit a doctor as soon as possible. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment. Read more about Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)",
    "cervicitis_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between acute cervicitis and chronic cervicitis? A: The difference between acute and chronic cervicitis pivots on how long the condition lasts. Acute cervicitis usually has an infectious cause, most typically STIs, and if properly treated will resolve relatively quickly. If not properly treated, it may become chronic, lasting for a longer period of time. Cervicitis caused by an irritant may also be acute, but is more often a chronic problem, especially if the cause – certain condoms or tampons, for example – are not avoided, and the inflammation is not allowed the time to heal properly. 9 Q: Is it possible to get cervicitis without an STI? A: Yes, in some cases, cervicitis is not caused by an STI. Sexually transmitted infections are the most common cause of the condition, but it can also be caused by allergies, injury, and vaginal bacteria imbalance (bacterial vaginosis) , among other things. Q: Can cervicitis cause infertility? A: Yes, in cases, where cervicitis is caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea and it spreads to the uterus or fallopian tubes via mechanisms not yet fully understood, but probably related to various inflammatory processes in infections with trichomonas, or when pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) , a related condition, develops. 10 11 If you are worried about the possibility of cervicitis complications, seeking immediate medical attention is advised.

These conditions are due to inherited genetic mutations which cause the genes to malfunction. Different mutations can lead to different types of Charcot-Marie-Tooth. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease can affect both the sensory and motoric nerves . The sensory nerves send information about touch, temperature, pain, and pressure to the brain. The motoric nerves send information from the brain to the muscles, resulting in muscle movement. 1",
    "how_many_types": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease can be divided into many different subtypes , depending on the specific genetic mutation you are affected by, the moment the first symptoms appear and whether the myelin sheath or the axon is affected by the condition. Some of the more common subtypes are: 1 2 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1a develops due to problems with the layer around the nerves called the myelin sheath. The symptoms often start during childhood and mostly include muscle weakness. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1b also develops due to problems with the myelin sheath. The symptoms can appear at any age, and both muscle weakness and numbness can be present. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 affects another part of the nerves called the axon. This can cause muscle weakness, numbness, and issues with speech or breathing. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 is a rare, but severe form of CMT nerve disease.

These mutations affect the nerves connecting your brain to the rest of your body. The nerves consist of several parts. With Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the axon or the myelin sheath will be affected . The axon is the part of the nerve through which electrical signals pass, while the myelin sheath is wrapped around the axon to protect it and to help guide the electrical signal through the nerve. When the axon or the myelin sheath gets damaged, it causes the electrical signal to get weaker. In severe cases, it can even stop the transmission of the electrical signal.

    "what_is_a_chest_cold": "A chest cold, or acute bronchitis, is a condition affecting the bronchial tubes of the lungs, causing short-term inflammation and irritation of these airways. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. Most often developing out of respiratory infections such as flu or a common cold, chest colds are caused – in most cases – by the same set of viruses as cause the common cold. In rare cases, a chest cold can also be caused by a bacterial infection. 1 Most people find that a chest cold clears up in two to three weeks, without the need for treatment. In severe cases or when the symptoms do not subside in the normal timeframe, doctors will recommend treatment options. A chest cold is generally considered to be a non-serious condition. However, there is a risk that a chest cold will develop into pneumonia – a more serious condition. A persistent chest cold may also be diagnosed as chronic bronchitis, a long-term condition that cannot be fully cured. 2 If you think that you may be experiencing a chest cold, a symptom assessment using the free Ada app may be able to help.\n\nChronic bronchitis differs from acute bronchitis by its persistent nature. Acute bronchitis, which shares the same symptoms as chronic bronchitis, is a short-term condition that typically fades in two to three weeks, whereas chronic bronchitis is a permanent or constantly recurring condition, most often caused by smoking or the inhalation of irritants or dust. To be classed as chronic bronchitis, a cough must be present for a minimum of three months in each of two consecutive years and all other possible causes ruled out.

If you are experiencing any symptoms of a chest cold, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "A chest cold can be either a viral or bacterial infection, though it is far more common to contract the condition virally. The viruses that cause the condition are of the same variety as those that cause the common cold or flu , and it usually develops from these conditions. If a cold or flu seems to worsen, therefore, it may be that a chest cold has developed. The viruses that cause a chest cold are most commonly passed on through tiny droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. The virus can survive on a surface such as a countertop or door-handle, for example, for up to 24 hours. To help avoid infection, individuals should take measures such as washing their hands thoroughly and avoiding sharing drinking glasses and utensils.",
    "diagnosing_a_chest_cold": "Doctors will usually be able to diagnose a chest cold by asking some questions about a person’s symptoms and by performing a physical examination. 5 In some cases, a doctor may order further tests to diagnose the condition or distinguish it from other conditions. These tests include: 6 Pulmonary function test: Used to check for signs of asthma or emphysema. Sputum tests: Used to identify the bacteria within sputum (mucus). X-ray: Potentially useful in identifying the source of an individual’s symptoms.",
    "chest_cold_treatment": "A chest cold does not require treatment in all cases – it will normally begin to fade in two to three weeks,** though the cough may persist for longer. If the coughing is particularly severe, cough medication is available over the counter, or it may be prescribed by a doctor. Pain relievers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be taken to suppress pain. For those with allergies, asthma or chronic obtrusive pulmonary disease, a range of medications can be prescribed as needed. 7 As a chest cold is in most cases caused by a virus, antibiotics are useless and may even be harmful. However, if it is thought that a chest cold is bacterial in origin, antibiotics can be used to effectively treat the condition.",
    "chest_cold_home_remedies": "Although treatment may not be necessary for a chest cold, there are a range of home remedies that can be used to manage its symptoms. Some of the most common home remedies include: Rest: Rest is vital in order to help the immune system regain its strength. Hydration: Drinking plenty of water helps thin out the mucus in the chest, making it easier to cough up. Hot drinks and lozenges: Drinks such as tea with honey and over-the-counter lozenges can provide some relief from certain symptoms. Steam: Steam from a hot shower or towel can help dislodge mucus and relieve symptoms. There are many natural products which can effectively help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold. These include: Apple cider vinegar: Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar helps thin the mucus in the chest, which can reduce congestion and help a person with a chest cold to breathe better. Drinking a solution of warm water mixed with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar two or three times a day for a week will help reduce the duration of a chest cold and strengthen the immune system, preventing future colds. Turmeric: Tumeric, a plant and spice that grows in Southeast-Asian and Middle-Eastern countries, is very effective at reducing the symptoms of a chest cold. It contains the compound curcumin, which has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Adding around a teaspoon of raw, grated turmeric or powdered tumeric to a hot drink several times a day or using it to flavour food can help alleviate the symptoms of a chest cold. Ginger: Ginger has been used as a natural remedy to treat various conditions for over 2000 years and is an effective agent in reducing the inflammation in the chest caused by a chest cold. It can be added to food in its raw state, brewed as a tea or taken as supplements. Essential oils: There are many different types of essential oils, each of which are particularly helpful with alleviating the symptoms of a different array of conditions. The most helpful essential oils for treating a chest cold include frankincense, oregano, eucalyptus, tea tree and lemon. Essential oils can be added to a hot compress, bath water, dabbed on the neck and temples or administered using a vaporiser/diffuser. When using essential oils to treat a chest cold, always consult the instructions on the packaging for the most appropriate way to apply them. Some herbal remedies and supplements are not compatible with underlying conditions or prescription medications. If, in addition to their chest cold, a person has a chronic (ongoing) condition and/or regularly takes any medications, they should consult their doctor before using any new natural products.",
    "chest_cold_prevention": "The viruses that in most cases cause a chest cold can be hard to avoid, spread as they are by tiny, often undetectable droplets released into the air or onto surfaces. However, certain measures can be taken to try and avoid these viruses. They include: 9 Washing hands frequently and thoroughly Getting plenty of rest Avoiding excessive touching of the eyes or mouth Avoiding sharing things such as drinking glasses or utensils Staying healthy with regular exercise, enough fluids and a balanced diet Getting vaccines for pneumonia , flu and whooping cough",
    "chest_cold_complications": "Complications that can develop from a chest cold include: Pneumonia: The symptoms of pneumonia are typically similar to those of a chest cold, though may be more severe. The condition is easily treatable with antibiotics, though it is important that it is distinguished from a chest cold first. Elderly people, smokers and those with preexistent liver or kidney conditions are most at risk from contracting pneumonia. Read more about Pneumonia » Chronic bronchitis: A permanent condition typically caused by smoking or exposure to airborne irritants. A persistent cough, lasting for at least three months in two consecutive years, is the chief symptom of chronic bronchitis. A doctor should be able to diagnose the condition.

    "chest_cold_faqs": "Q: What is the duration of a chest cold? A: Typically, a chest cold will develop three or four days after a cold or the flu and lasts for around two to three weeks. However, this is approximate and symptoms may last for longer. If this is the case, medical attention should be sought. Q: I am pregnant . Should I be worried about a chest cold? A: Special care should be taken by pregnant women to avoid a chest cold. However, if the condition does develop, women should be sure to consult a doctor who should be able to advise on an appropriate treatment method, if one is needed at all, including identifying medications that are safe to take during pregnancy. 11 Unfortunately, when pregnant, a chest cold is more likely to develop into a more serious respiratory condition like pneumonia. Seek urgent medical attention if the following symptoms develop: Chest pain Blood in the mucus High fever Unrelenting shortness of breath Q: Is a chest cold contagious? A: Yes, the viruses that typically cause chest colds, are contagious. Avoid contact with infected individuals, wash your hands regularly and avoid sharing utensils and glasses to lessen the chances of picking up the condition. Q: Are chest colds viral or bacterial? A: In approximately 85 to 95 percent of cases, acute bronchitis is caused by a virus. 12 The viruses are the same as those that cause the common cold and flu . People with underlying health conditions, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, are more likely than otherwise healthy people to experience bacterial acute bronchitis. Q: Can a chest cold turn into pneumonia? A: Pneumonia can result from a chest cold as a secondary complication. Older people are especially susceptible to this. Symptoms of pneumonia include fever, an increased heart rate, chest pain and shortness of breath. 1"

    "condition": "Childhood Absence Epilepsy",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/childhood-absence-epilepsy/",
    "what_is_childhood_absence_epilepsy": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is a type of epilepsy characterized by recurrent seizures in young children. 1 These seizures, known as absence seizures, briefly impair the consciousness of the affected child, causing them to stare blankly into space and become unresponsive, among other reactions. Immediately after the seizure, which will usually last for around 10 seconds, the child will return to normal and may not even realize that the seizure has taken place. 2 Seizures typically occur often, sometimes up to 200 times per day. ref1 While a person of any age can experience absence seizures, childhood absence epilepsy is specific to children and will usually first occur in children of between five and eight years old. 1 Most children affected by the condition will cease to experience seizures by mid-adolescence. However, for some, seizures may continue into adolescence and other types of seizures may also develop, such as tonic-clonic seizures. ref1 The cause of childhood absence epilepsy is thought to be largely genetic, with one in three affected children having a family history of similar seizures. 2 Treatment involves the use of medication and is generally effective at controlling seizures.",
    "symptoms": "The key symptom of childhood absence epilepsy is absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures. Absence seizures may cause the affected child to: 3 4 Stare blankly into space Stop talking or interacting Suddenly stop moving Become unresponsive Repeatedly move their fingers, hands or mouth without apparent purpose Repeatedly flutter or flicker their eyelids Seizures last for an average of 5 to 15 seconds. 3 Following a seizure, the affected child will typically resume normal activity and may be unaware that the seizure has taken place. Seizures can first appear in children of between three and eleven years old, but most often occur in children of between three and eight. 2 They are marginally more common in girls than boys. Without treatment, seizures tend to occur frequently, sometimes up to 200 times per day. 1 They are more likely to occur when a child is bored, tired or not engaged in an activity and become less likely when a child is concentrating. 3 Seizures are unlikely to impact upon the development of the affected child. However, children who experience a high frequency of seizures may develop some learning difficulties. 3 Good to know: It is possible for children to be affected by atypical absence seizures. This less common type of seizure tends to begin and end more gradually than a typical absence seizure. Generally, they also last longer, though they can last anywhere between 5 and 30 seconds. 5 Children experiencing possible symptoms of childhood absence epilepsy should see a doctor for evaluation. In addition, parents and carers can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Childhood absence epilepsy is a type of epilepsy. The seizures associated with epilepsy occur as a result of uncontrollable bursts of electrical activity in the brain. The underlying cause of the condition is generally genetic, though environmental factors may contribute to its onset in some cases. 1 The genetic element is complex and not fully understood, with several genes and genetic changes thought to play a role. ref1\n\nThe complexity of the genetics behind childhood absence epilepsy means, that its inheritance pattern is also not straightforward. When associated with some genes, GABA receptors or calcium channel genes, for example, the condition follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that a faulty gene from just one parent could be enough to pass on the condition. 1 When associated with other genes, however, the inheritance pattern may be different. Roughly one in three children with childhood absence epilepsy have a family history of similar seizures. The siblings of affected children have an estimated 1 in 10 chance of also developing the condition. 5",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis will usually be based upon a detailed description of the symptoms being experienced and a physical examination. A hyperventilation test may be performed. This involves asking the child to hyperventilate, or breathe quickly, for three to four minutes, sometimes while counting aloud and with their eyes closed. In 90 percent of cases, this will cause the child to experience an absence seizure. 3 Doctors may also order an electroencephalogram (EEG). During this test, which can be performed in a doctor’s office or hospital, the child will be asked to lie flat while disk-shaped electrodes are attached to the scalp. Connected to a monitoring device, these electrodes are able to monitor the electrical activity of the brain. Those affected by childhood absence epilepsy tend to present a distinctive pattern of brain activity, making this test an important step in confirming a diagnosis of childhood absence epilepsy. 4 5 Often, doctors will record an EEG at the same time as performing a hyperventilation test. In most cases, no further tests will be necessary. However, if the condition does not improve following treatment, a number of additional tests may be ordered. These include: 1 3 A ct scan or MRI scan to check the location of the problem in the brain Genetic testing to help identify the gene or genes responsible for the condition",
    "childhood_absence_epilepsy_treatment": "Childhood absence epilepsy can be effectively managed using medication. The two most commonly prescribed medications are ethosuximide and sodium valproate, also known as valproic acid. 5 6 Both have been shown to be effective at controlling absence seizures in 80 percent of cases. ref6 Sodium valproate may be preferred in instances where the child also experiences other types of seizures, such as clonic-tonic seizures. Lamotrigine has also been proven to be effective in some cases. It may also produce fewer side-effects than ethosuximide and sodium valproate. 5 Although other medications have been used to control absence seizures, most of these medications have not had their efficacy proven through controlled trials. ref5 If the use of a single type of medication proves ineffective, a combination may be used. This has shown to be effective in half of all cases where the affected child does not respond to a single medication. Persisting with a single type of medication until the maximum possible dose has been prescribed is generally recommended, however. 6",
    "prognosis": "The prognosis for childhood absence epilepsy is very good. 7 Through the use of medication, approximately 70 percent of children with the condition will have their seizures completely controlled by mid-adolescence. 2 3 In around 10 percent of cases, children with CAE will develop other types of seizures in adolescence, most commonly clonic-tonic seizures. Similarly to CAE, these seizures can usually be controlled effectively through the use of medication. 3",
    "other_names_for_childhood_absence_epilepsy": "absence seizures petit mal seizures",
    "faqs": "Q: How common is childhood absence epilepsy? A: Childhood absence epilepsy affects around 2 to 8 in 100,000 children each year. 1 Around 8 percent of children with epilepsy have CAE, making it one of the more common types of epilepsy in children. 8 Q: What is the difference between childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE)? A: Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) are similar conditions, both involving the presence of absence seizures and both typically responding well to medication. However, whereas CAE usually first presents between the ages of 3 and 8, JAE presents later, generally between the ages of 10 and 17. 1 9 Compared to CAE, people with JAE also tend to experience fewer absence seizures. They are, however, more likely to experience additional types of seizures: an estimated 80 percent of those with JAE also experience clonic-tonic seizures, and around 15 percent also experience myoclonic seizures. 9"

    "condition": "Childhood Asthma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/childhood-asthma/",
    "what_is_asthma_in_children": "Asthma is a disease which primarily affects the bronchial tubes in the lungs , called the airways. Children affected by asthma typically experience breathing difficulties due to the inflammation of the airways. Asthma can cause acute discomfort – such as an asthma attack – and can have a debilitating effect on the child’s overall health, including symptoms like tiredness, depleted strength and recurrent coughing. The most common signs of asthma include: Wheezing Chest pain Shortness of breath These symptoms may be present every day or only during an asthma attack. Asthma affects around 6.2 million children in the U.S. 1 If a child experiences recurrent coughing, wheezing, tightness or pain in their chest or shortness of breath, it is important to consult a doctor, as one or more of these symptoms may indicate childhood-onset asthma. When the respiratory system is functioning normally, as in a healthy child, the airways allow oxygen to pass into the lungs, which supply it to the rest of the body via the bloodstream. The airways of an asthmatic child are hypersensitive and will react by becoming inflamed and swollen when certain physical and environmental triggers enter the airways. This swelling makes it difficult for sufficient air to pass through the airways to the lungs, causing the child to experience breathing difficulties. The potential impact of childhood-onset asthma on a child’s quality of life and long-term health can be significantly minimised by identifying appropriate treatment to bring their symptoms under control. Children with untreated asthma tire more easily after exercise than their peers and are prone to coughing and wheezing. With effective treatment, it is possible to reduce the symptoms of asthma, so that asthmatic children can carry out their day-to-day activities as normal, including participating in exercise and outdoor activities.",
    "symptoms": "Children are affected by asthma more commonly than adults. Asthma in children usually starts to develop in early childhood. Asthmatic children often present symptoms at under five years of age. Despite the presence of asthma-like symptoms, it can be difficult to diagnose asthma in infants and young children, as their lungs may not be developed sufficiently to carry out certain tests. One of the first signs that a child might be affected by asthma is an involuntary whistling sound which accompanies their breathing. This is commonly known as “wheezing.” Typically, wheezing is especially prominent when the child exhales. Other possible signs and symptoms of childhood-onset asthma include: Chest pain Chest tightness Depleted stamina after play or exercise Diminished energy throughout the day Difficulty drawing breath Recurrent coughing, typically at night Retractions (involuntary pulling in of the chest which occurs as a result of laboured breathing) Shortness of breath If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be showing signs of asthma, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .\n\nWhen a child experiences an asthma attack, their airways are reacting to specific triggers in the environment. 2 The absolute cause of asthma is still unknown, but there are many different triggers (stimuli) which are associated with bringing on asthma attacks or aggravating asthmatic symptoms. Triggers affect every child differently. Children may appear to outgrow, or become immune to, certain triggers. Equally, they may develop new sensitivities as they mature. The intensity of their adverse reactions to specific triggers may also increase or decrease. Environmental triggers of asthma in children include: Airborne irritants (such as pet dander) and pollutants (such as scented cleaning products) Weather conditions, especially changes in temperature or humidity Physical triggers of asthma in children include: Allergies Emotional extremes such as stress, anger or nervousness Exercise Gastroesophageal reflux In infants, feeding Negative reactions to pharmaceutical medications such as painkillers Respiratory infections such as colds and/or flu Skin or food allergies can cause asthma symptoms to occur in some children. This is called allergy-induced asthma or allergic asthma.\n\nAllergy-induced asthma is the most common type of asthma. Allergic asthmatic children are simultaneously affected by allergies and asthma. It is possible to confuse an allergic reaction, such as hay fever, with a flare-up of asthma. It can be difficult to determine whether a child’s symptoms relate to either condition, or to a combination of both. This is further complicated by the fact that it is possible for both reactions to be stimulated by the same trigger. Allergens which commonly trigger allergic asthmatic reactions in children include: Dander from pets Dust mites House dust Pollen If a child appears to be affected by asthmatic symptoms, allergic reactions or a combination of the two, it is advisable to visit a health care provider or an allergist, who will be able to help identify the principal triggers, and suggest further stimuli to be avoided. An allergist may also decide to prescribe medications against allergy symptoms, such as antihistamines. These will need to be factored into the child’s overall treatment plan, which will involve measures to manage their asthma. These may include asthma medications, immunology programmes and/or the use of a nebulizer, depending on the severity of the child’s condition and how often they experience a flare-up. (See Treatment for more information.)",
    "causes": "It is not always possible to identify the cause of asthma in children, and a child may develop the condition with no apparent triggers. The main possible causes of asthma in children are: Genetic predisposition. Children with a family history of asthma, eczema, hives and/or allergic rhinitis develop asthma more commonly than those without. Environmental factors. Exposure to air pollutants, including cigarette smoke and potential triggers of asthma, including dust mites, pollen and pet dander, may cause children to develop  asthma. Infections. Children may develop asthma as a result of certain types of infections that affect the airways, including viral infections such as the common cold.",
    "risk_factors": "Some children are at greater risk of developing asthma than others. Risk factors for developing asthma include: A family history of asthma and related conditions such as eczema A medical history of allergic reactions, including food and pet allergies, skin reactions and hay fever Living in an urban area, where there is greater exposure to pollution Regular exposure to potential triggers of asthma such as cigarette smoke and pet dander Obesity Other respiratory conditions, including sinusitis (inflamed sinuses) and/or a chronic blocked nose (rhinitis) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Before puberty, boys are at greater risk of developing asthma than girls; the biological reasons for this are not yet medically understood. 3",
    "diagnosis": "Each child experiences asthma differently, and a child may not exhibit all of the symptoms or respond to all the triggers listed. Within individual children, asthma symptoms and their severity may change. It is usual for the doctor to consider a range of possible causes for the child’s symptoms, in order to eliminate other conditions before offering a definitive diagnosis of asthma. Non-allergic conditions that typically cause asthma-like symptoms include: Aspiration (when pieces of food or other small items accidentally pass into the airway) Pulmonary Aspergillosis (a fungal infection of the lung) Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Rhinitis (runny, stuffy nose) Sinusitis Vocal cord dysfunction Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Airway abnormalities caused by such as an esophageal disorder(where acid from the stomach triggers a reaction that inflames the airways) or neuromuscular respiratory diseases Many of these conditions commonly co-occur with asthma. A diagnosis of asthma in a child therefore requires the doctor to determine whether the child’s symptoms are purely asthmatic, caused by a condition other than asthma, or whether the child has developed another condition in addition to asthma.\n\nA variety of tests are available to help diagnose asthma in children, including lung function tests and allergy skin tests. These tests usually work best for children of five years and older. To diagnose asthma in children of 5 years and older, doctors tend to use the same tests that are used to identify the disease in adults. The main tests used to identify asthma are:\n\nLung function tests (spirometry) are primary tests used to measure how much air the child can exhale and how quickly. They involve using a device called a spirometer, attached to a mouthpiece by a cable. 4 To determine the severity of the asthma diagnosis, the child’s lung function is usually measured during three levels of activity: after taking asthma medication, after exercising and at rest. Lung function tests employ flow volume loops to measure how quickly the child can inhale, and their maximum intake of breath in one inhalation. This helps detect obstruction of air in the neck, such as vocal cord paralysis or dysfunction- which helps to identify any non-asthmatic conditions that may be a correct or additional diagnosis.\n\nWhen a child is diagnosed with asthma, and  the doctor suspects that they may be affected by allergic asthma , allergy skin tests may be used in addition to the tests for asthma to test for possible triggers which may be causing the symptoms. The skin is pricked, and solutions containing extracts of common allergy-causing substances are applied, such as animal dander, mold or dust mites. The child is then observed for signs of an allergic reaction.\n\nThe Methacholine challenge test (MCT) is used to diagnose mild or intermittent (occurring at irregular intervals) asthma. If lung function tests do not result in the child’s asthma diagnosis, a doctor may order a methacholine challenge test. During this test, the child inhales increasing amounts of a mist of methacholine before and after spirometry. Methacholine is a drug that stimulates the nervous system and causes wheezing and shortness of breath.\n\nIn some cases, a body plethysmography test may be carried out in addition to the diagnostic tests above. In this test, a child will breathe in and out in an instrument called a body box. The body box is airtight, and breathing in and out of it causes changes to the air pressure inside the box. Medical professionals can monitor the air pressure inside the box to add many details to their understanding of how well a child’s respiratory system is performing. This test can be used to measure factors including the volume of air present in the lungs after breathing normally, the specific airway resistance (how much the respiratory tract resists airflow when a person breathes in and out) of the lungs and their total lung capacity. 5\n\nIt is often very hard for doctors to provide a conclusive diagnosis of asthma in children under 5 years of age, as their lungs are not sufficiently developed to accurately carry out lung function tests. Many other conditions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, and respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis, have the same symptoms as asthma. For this reason, doctors often opt to observe a child’s symptoms over a longer period with regular check-ups, until it is possible to provide an asthma diagnosis.",
    "treatment": "There is no cure for asthma, but asthma can be managed with proper prevention and treatment. Treatment for childhood asthma focuses on minimising exposure to any identified triggers, so as to avoid flare-ups. With the right treatment options identified, it should be possible for a child to pursue their activities, including sports and exercise, as normal. As children learn to avoid asthma triggers, it is possible for them to manage their symptoms so effectively that they appear to “outgrow” their asthma. More than three-quarters of children who develop asthma symptoms before age 7 no longer exhibit perceptible symptoms by age 16. However, there is always the possibility of further flare-ups, and asthma, which has been successfully managed for long periods, can resurface later in childhood, or in adulthood. Types of medication for childhood asthma include long-term medications, courses of immunology and quick-relief medications to unblock the airways during an asthmatic flare-up. Good to know: Children with asthma may also be referred to an allergist who will be able to advise on specialised treatment, if their asthma is allergy-induced.\n\nA range of different medications are available, depending on the severity of a child’s asthma. When a child’s symptoms respond well to treatment and the asthma is eventually running a lighter course over time, doctors may suggest switching to milder medications.\n\nThese medications  are considered to be the most effective medications for controlling asthma when taken regularly. They work on a continuous basis to reduce swelling of the airways. The most commonly prescribed ICSs include fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco) and beclomethasone (Qvar). These medications need to be taken regularly for several days to weeks, adhering to the prescription, before the child feels their full anti-asthmatic effects.\n\nThese medications are nebulized medications which provide immediate relief of asthma symptoms. They work by relaxing the inflamed airways, making breathing easier. SABA medications, for example,  include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA).\n\nThese medications work by relaxing the muscles surrounding the bronchial tubes, which causes a widening of the airways. It is recommended that the long-acting beta agonists be used in combination with an anti-inflammatory medication, such as the inhaled corticosteroids.The most commonly prescribed LABA medications in the U.S. are salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil) and a formoterol solution for nebulizers called Perforomist.\n\nThese medications contain both a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) and a corticosteroid. These drugs have very different ways of influencing the airways and have been found to offer a child the most benefit when they are combined. This allows a child to profit from both of their mechanisms of action at the same time and makes combination nebulizers an effective treatment option for childhood asthma (as well as adult asthma) in many cases. Commonly prescribed combination nebulizers include combinations of fluticasone plus salmeterol (Advair), mometasone plus formoterol (Dulera) and budesonide plus formoterol (Symbicort).\n\nThese medications are oral medications that can reduce asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. They include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate) and zileuton (Zyflo). Care should be taken when taking leukotriene modifiers as they have been, in rare cases, linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Medical advice should be sought immediately if the child has any unusual reaction.\n\nThese medications are another treatment option for severe asthma. They work by widening the airways to allow for easier breathing. The most commonly prescribed anticholinergic medication is tiotropium (Spiriva).\n\nThese medications can be used to treat very severe cases of asthma in children, where symptoms persist despite the use of SABA, LABA and corticosteroid medications. This treatment involves introducing antibodies (biological agents which interact with the bodies cells to fight and interrupt the usual progression of an asthma attack) into the body. The antibodies which are used to treat asthma in children are Anti-IgE (omalizumab) and anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab). Both of these medications have been found effective for treating asthma in children. In particular, in reducing exacerbation rate; the medical term for the condition becoming worse, or more symptoms developing, which can happen in a flare-up or an asthma attack. Their other benefits include helping bring a child’s asthmatic symptoms under control and improving their quality of life. Mepolizumab (Nucala) may be appropriate for children with eosinophilic asthma, a subtype of asthma which is often severe, in which the whole respiratory tract becomes involved in obstructing the airways. mepolizumab works by reducing the number of eosinophils in the blood; the white blood cells that in large numbers interact with other factors in the blood and cause the airways to become inflamed, and thereby reduces the likelihood of an asthma attack for children with this type of asthma. Omalizumab (Xolair) is used to treat children affected specifically by allergic asthma. It works by targeting immunoglobulin E, the substance produced by the body that causes inflammation of the airways in children with allergic asthma. This medication reduces the immune system's reaction to allergy-inducing substances, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander, and calms inflammation. It is usually delivered by injection every two to four weeks. Omalizumab is the only medication for asthma which must be administered by injection only. If it is recommended for treating a child, they will need to visit their healthcare provider to have the medication administered.\n\nThe Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA ) provides a five-stage treatment plan which is very helpful in devising the right treatment plan to suit the individual asthmatic child. The GINA guidelines arrange a series of asthma treatment options as a sequence, Following the GINA guidelines, a doctor will prescribe a treatment plan and assess its efficacy during regular check-ups. They will adjust the plan accordingly, continually measuring the child’s response to their treatment and refining the plan as needed, until the symptoms of asthma improve. The guidelines recommend a five-step plan for the ongoing treatment of asthma, according to the severity of the child’s condition. Children with mild asthma will be treated according to the guidelines outlined in Step 1 (see below) and children with more severe symptoms will begin treatment according to the guidelines outlined in Step 2, 3, 4 or 5, depending on the severity of their asthma at the time of starting treatment. A step down to a milder treatment option can be considered during a monthly check-up, if the doctor considers the child’s symptoms to have improved sufficiently. The GINA approach to controlling asthma symptoms aimed at reducing risk and improving asthma management includes the following steps:\n\nThe doctor will consider prescribing a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and will prescribe a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for relief as needed. Acting within minutes, and lasting several hours, short acting beta agonists are nebulized medications which can quickly relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. ICSs work by  relieving airway inflammation caused by asthma. Good to know: Long-term corticosteroid use is generally associated with severe side-effects, but the inhalatory steroids used in ICSs do not carry the same risks. When an ICS is administered correctly, the corticosteroid medication goes straight to a child’s airways and very little is absorbed into the rest of their body. ICSs are therefore safe for use on a long-term basis and tend to show their best effects after around three months of use. 6\n\nThe doctor will definitely prescribe a low-dose ICS, as is considered for children at Step 1, as well as prescribing a SABA for relief as needed.\n\nA low-dose ICS or a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) will be prescribed and a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.  In some situations, long-acting beta agonists have been linked to severe asthma attacks if they are taken only by themselves without an ICS. For this reason, LABA medications should always be given to a child with a nebulizer that also contains a corticosteroid (ICS). These combination nebulizers should be used only for asthma that's not well-controlled by other medications.\n\nA medium to high ICS/LABA will be prescribed and additionally SABA or another low dose ICS for relief as needed.\n\nThe doctor will refer the child for an add-on treatment for severe asthma, such as anticholinergic agents or immunomodulatory agents. They will also prescribe a SABA or ICS for relief as needed.\n\nDesensitization or hyposensitization (immunotherapy) : Allergen-containing injections or oral medication gradually reduce any reaction of the child’s immune system to specific allergens over a period of months or years. The length of the course and intervals between injections vary according to the individual’s symptoms. Oral and nasal medications : The child may be prescribed antihistamines and decongestants in pill form, as well as, or as an alternative to corticosteroid, cromolyn (a drug that prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells) and ipratropium nasal sprays.",
    "childhood_asthma_faqs": "Q: Does childhood asthma damage the lungs? A: It is important to diagnose and begin treating asthma in children promptly, in order to prevent it causing long-term damage to the lungs. Chronic (long-term) asthma, or asthma which is not treated effectively over the course of many years, has the potential to damage the lungs on a permanent basis in two main ways: by causing airway fibrosis (scarring) of the tissue in the airways and by causing remodelling (permanent narrowing of the airways). 7 Both of these changes result from the respiratory system being inflamed regularly for long periods. Not everybody has the potential to develop permanent lung damage from the inflammation associated with asthma, but it is important that all children with asthma begin effective treatment as soon as possible to avoid this outcome. The Asthma Center recommends that early and intensive treatment of childhood asthma should be focussed particularly on calming inflammation in order to reduce the risk of long-term lung damage. Q: Can childhood asthma cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? A: Not usually, especially if asthma in children is treated promptly and effectively. The primary causes of COPD – a type of obstructive lung disease associated with long term breathing problems and poor air flow which usually develops in adulthood – are smoking tobacco and exposure to poor quality air, for example, living in an area with high pollution. However, COPD can also be caused by genetic factors and people, who are affected by asthma or who have been affected as children, are believed to be at greater risk than the general population of developing the condition. 8 Recent research indicates that persistent (long term, severe or ineffectively treated) childhood asthma can lead to reduced lung growth and function in adulthood, an outcome which is found to increase the possibility of developing COPD. 9 Q: Can childhood asthma come back during pregnancy? A: Many children appear to “outgrow” childhood asthma. However, there is no cure for asthma and there is always the possibility that a child may encounter new triggers and re-experience the symptoms as an adult. Pregnancy may place unfamiliar stresses on the body, which could trigger asthmatic symptoms. 10 Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chiragra/",
    "what_is_chiragra": "Chiragra is a form of gout which affects the joints of the hands, and results in acute, painful episodes (attacks) of inflammation. The inflammation is caused by too much uric acid which forms small crystals in and around the joints. Uric acid is increased in the body by eating certain foods (especially seafood, red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys), as well as by drinking alcohol. The main symptoms of chiragra are swelling, tenderness and redness of the hand joints. Gout tends to affect people over 30 years old and men more commonly than women.",
    "risks": "Gout is the underlying cause of chiragra and is caused by excess amounts of uric acid in the blood, which forms crystals in the joints. These crystals are very irritating, and cause the joint to become inflamed (red, swollen and painful). Gout is a very common condition. It tends to affect more men than women, and becomes increasingly more common with age. Drinking alcohol, eating red meat or organ meats (such as liver or kidneys) and using certain medications (such as heart failure and high blood pressure medications) increases the chances of having gout.",
    "symptoms": "Typical symptoms include a severe pain in the hand and finger joints associated with redness, swelling, difficulty moving the joints and sometimes tophi (uric acid crystals deposits appearing as yellowish firm nodules). Symptoms often come on suddenly, and attacks of gout are often recurrent.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the individual's medical history and physical examination. A doctor may take a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to look for evidence of gout crystals in the joint. Blood tests can monitor the amount of uric acid in the blood. Ultrasounds or X-rays of the joint may be helpful to look for signs of damage as a result of gout.",
    "treatment": "Pain and swelling during an attack of chiragra is managed with anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medications (such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or colchicine). Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, a healthy diet and taking regular exercise, might also be helpful in the management of gout.",
    "prevention": "Preventing future attacks of gout can be done by changing the diet to avoid foods which trigger attacks of gout and (if needed) with a medication called allopurinol. Allopurinol reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood. Losing weight might also be helpful preventing future attacks of gout.",

    "condition": "Cholecystitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cholecystitis/",
    "what_is_cholecystitis": "Cholecystitis is the medical term for inflammation of the gallbladder. The condition tends to be more prevalent among women than men and is more common in older adults. 1 The gallbladder stores bile, which is a liquid produced by the liver to help digest fatty foods. After eating, the gallbladder typically squeezes bile down the bile tract and into the intestines. In most, but not all cases, acute cholecystitis is caused by gallstones from the gallbladder blocking the drainage of bile. The condition often causes sudden, lasting pain in the upper or upper-right areas of the belly. 1 2 Treatment, which often requires going to a hospital, may initially involve pain-relief measures, fluids and antibiotics. In most cases, the gallbladder will need to be removed in a surgical procedure called a cholecystectomy. 3 With appropriate treatment, the outlook for uncomplicated cases of cholecystitis is generally very good, and most people recover well. 4",
    "cholecystitis_symptoms": "Severe pain in the upper or upper-right area of the belly is the most common symptom of acute cholecystitis. The pain may radiate into the right shoulder, and breathing in deeply may make it feel worse. It tends to be constant and is long-lasting, typically persisting for several hours. 1 5 Other symptoms associated with gallbladder inflammation may include: 2 3 5 Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Sweating Fever In some cases, yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, known as jaundice Symptoms can vary, depending on the individual person and what is causing the cholecystitis. They may be worse after a meal. 1 Elderly people, particularly those who have diabetes , may experience tenderness rather than pain and other vague symptoms, such as feeling unwell and weak. 5 6 Good to know: If fever is present in a case of gallbladder inflammation, it may indicate a bacterial infection, which will typically require treatment with antibiotics. 5 If fever and/or jaundice is present or symptoms are severe, it is recommended that you seek medical care without delay. Gallbladder inflammation can lead to serious complications if left untreated.",
    "causes": "There are two main causes of acute gallbladder inflammation: 2 6 7 8 In cases described as calculous cholecystitis, the cause of inflammation is thought to be the gallbladder being blocked or irritated by gallstones. Calculous cholecystitis accounts for the vast majority, 90-95 percent, of cases of gallbladder inflammation. In cases described as acalculous cholecystitis, the cause of inflammation is not gallstones, but a serious underlying illness, infection or injury that affects the gallbladder, causing bile to build up and become stagnant. This type of cholecystitis is less common and is seen more often in people with severe or critical illness. It may be difficult to recognize and can be extremely serious. 4\n\nGallstones are the main risk factor for developing cholecystitis. Other, related risk factors for gallbladder inflammation may include the following: 2 4 7 9 Being female Increasing age A family history of cholecystitis Having European, Native American or Hispanic heritage Being overweight or obese Pregnancy Certain medical conditions, including Crohn’s disease Rapid weight loss, e.g. as experienced after weight-loss surgery or intense dieting\n\nCholecystitis without gallstones, which is far less common, is generally associated with factors that include: 1 10 8 Failure of multiple organs Serious burns or other injuries Intravenous feeding (parenteral nutrition) for long periods of time Being in intensive care Cardiovascular disease Diabetes Sepsis Advanced stages of HIV Good to know: Unlike calculous cholecystitis, acalculous cholecystitis seems to occur slightly more frequently in men than women. It is more prevalent among older adults.",
    "diagnosis": "As a first step, a doctor will assess the person’s symptoms, take their medical history and perform a physical examination. The doctor might press on the upper-right area of the belly, just below the ribcage, and ask the person to take a deep breath, checking for what is known as Murphy’s sign. Pain that is felt during this test may indicate that the gallbladder is inflamed. 1 2 3 The doctor may order a urine test to check for signs of kidney problems and blood tests to check for signs of infection or problems in the liver or pancreas. They may also request that an ultrasound scan computed tomography (CT) scan or other imaging tests be performed to examine the gallbladder and other parts of the abdomen and confirm the diagnosis. 6 11 It is important to rule out other conditions that may sometimes cause symptoms similar to gallbladder inflammation, including: 1 Appendicitis Gastritis Pancreatitis Kidney stones Good to know: If, after a full examination, the doctor thinks that you have gallbladder inflammation, they may refer you to hospital to ensure that you receive prompt treatment. 2\n\nImaging tests for suspected cholecystitis may include the following: 12 2 3 9 11 13 14 15 Abdominal ultrasound. A quick, non-invasive scan that uses sound waves to check for the presence of inflammation and gallstones in the gallbladder. An ultrasound is usually the first imaging test performed if cholecystitis or cholelithiasis (gallstones) is suspected. CT scan. A scan that uses multiple X-rays in multiple layers to confirm the presence of gallbladder inflammation, as well as check for possible complications, e.g. a rupture. MRI. A scan that uses powerful magnets and radio waves. An MRI may sometimes be used instead of a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy. A test that uses a safe, weakly-radioactive substance and a special camera to assess the functioning of the gallbladder and whether it is inflamed. This test is also known as a hydroxy iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan or hepatobiliary scan, or cholescintigraphy. It is considered to be highly accurate in the diagnosis of cholecystitis. Cholangiography. A test that uses dye and X-rays to check for suspected gallstones and problems in the biliary system, i.e. the liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. 16 This test may form part of a procedure called an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), where a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope is used to diagnose and remove gallstones that have become stuck in bile ducts. Plain X-rays. These are not considered very accurate in confirming a diagnosis of gallbladder inflammation. However, X-rays may be recommended to check for other possible causes of the person’s symptoms.",
    "treatment": "While it depends on the cause and severity of the condition, initial treatment of cholecystitis will usually involve pain-relief measures, intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration and sometimes antibiotics. Generally, surgical removal of the gallbladder will be necessary, and it may be recommended that this take place within the next day or two. Prompt arrangement of surgery is generally preferred. 17 1 2 3 6 In mild, uncomplicated cases, it may sometimes be possible for a person to receive initial treatment without a hospital stay and then go to hospital to prepare for surgery on the date determined by their doctor. However, in more severe cases of gallbladder inflammation, immediate hospitalization may be needed. 17 9\n\nSurgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, is the standard treatment for most cases of cholecystitis. It is a common procedure. 2 7 There are two types of gallbladder surgery: 3 9 13 18 19 20 21 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A type of keyhole surgery where the gallbladder is removed through a small incision in the abdomen. In some cases, a person may be able to go home on the same day, though they might be kept in hospital for a few days after the surgery for monitoring. Open cholecystectomy. An older type of surgery that requires a bigger incision in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder. This may be necessary if a laparoscopy is not advisable or complications arise. The recovery time tends to be longer for this type of surgery.\n\nA person can live a normal, healthy life without their gallbladder. When it is removed, bile simply flows directly from the liver into the intestine via the common bile duct, aiding digestion as usual. In some cases, there may be mild cases of loose stools or indigestion for a while as the body adjusts. This is usually temporary. The risk of complications from a cholecystectomy is considered low. 2 9 13 21 22\n\nIn cases where a person is unable to undergo surgery because the risks are too great, doctors might insert a catheter into the gallbladder to drain it and reduce the inflammation – this is called a percutaneous cholecystostomy. Surgery to remove the gallbladder will typically then be recommended for when the person is in a more stable condition and able to undergo the operation. 17 1 6 In cases where surgery is not immediately possible, the gallbladder may also be drained using a procedure called an endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural cholecystostomy. This makes use of an endoscope tube and the guidance of an ultrasound scan to perform the drainage. 17 Read about treatment of gallstones, the most common cause of gallbladder inflammation »",
    "complications": "If left untreated, cholecystitis can result in serious complications, some of which may be life-threatening. Possible complications include: 2 23 24 Gangrenous cholecystitis, where gallbladder tissue dies and becomes susceptible to infection, potentially resulting in sepsis 25 Gallbladder perforation, where the gallbladder ruptures and bile leaks out, potentially resulting in infection within the abdomen itself or an abscess forming Read about other possible complications of gallbladder disease » In these cases, emergency treatment is usually required. If the following symptoms are present, it is important to seek medical help immediately: 6 23 Sudden, severe pain in the belly, which worsens High fever Chills, shivering and sweating Vomiting Rapid heartbeat\n\nSometimes, gallbladder inflammation persists for a long period of time. In such cases, the term ‘chronic cholecystitis’ is used. Chronic gallbladder inflammation is almost always caused by gallstones . With repeat episodes of acute cholecystitis, sometimes called gallbladder attacks, which occur in chronic cholecystitis, the gallbladder can become damaged, and its functioning may be impaired. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). 26 27 Chronic gallbladder inflammation may increase the risk of gallbladder cancer . 1 If gallbladder inflammation is known or suspected, it is important to seek medical treatment to minimize the risk of complications occurring.\n\nAfter having their gallbladder removed, an estimated 1 in 10 people develop what is known as postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). They may experience a number of symptoms associated with gallbladder disease, as well as symptoms related to removal of the gallbladder. 13 Read more about post-cholecystectomy syndrome »",

If cholecystitis occurs in pregnancy, surgery to remove the gallbladder may be necessary to avoid complications. This usually takes the form of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and is generally considered to be safe at any stage of pregnancy. 28 29 30 Some doctors may prefer to treat a pregnant person with pain-relief measures, fluid replacement and antibiotics initially, recommending gallbladder surgery after the baby has been delivered.

    "cholecystitis_faqs": "Q: Is cholecystitis an emergency? A: In some cases, acute cholecystitis may be a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment at a hospital. In other cases, emergency treatment may not be required. However, because it is a serious condition that can result in potentially life-threatening complications, including sepsis, a doctor should be seen as soon as possible if inflammation of the gallbladder is suspected. If symptoms are severe, seek emergency assistance. 17 12 Q: Can cholecystitis be treated without surgery? A: Surgery to remove the gallbladder, called cholecystectomy, is the standard treatment for cholecystitis. However, in cases where a person is unable to undergo surgery, non-surgical treatment may sometimes be recommended. 32 Q: Do I have cholecystitis?

The most common cholera symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to severe dehydration. Cholera treatment mainly consists of rehydration and possibly antibiotics. Cholera usually occurs in places with a lack of hygiene, little accessibility to safe drinking water, and low sanitary facilities.\n\nCholera is a disease that can cause severe diarrhea and can even lead to death . Knowing the symptoms of cholera and the available treatments is therefore essential, especially if you live in or travel through an area where cholera occurs. In this article, Ada’s medical team will guide you through all there’s to know about cholera.",
    "what_s_cholera": "Cholera is an acute infection with a bacteria called Vibrio cholerae. It originated in the 19th century in India and spread all over the world. Several cholera pandemics throughout history cost the lives of millions of people. Currently, cholera is still present and is deemed endemic in many countries, meaning that it's a disease that occurs regularly within that country. Each year, there are about 1.3 to 4 million cases of cholera worldwide. 1",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Cholera symptoms usually develop between 12 hours and 5 days after ingesting the bacteria. Most people experiencing cholera disease will only develop mild to moderate sudden diarrhea. In some cases, cholera can cause severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration. If left untreated, this can even result in death. 1 Besides watery diarrhea , cholera can also cause: 2 Vomiting Leg cramps Restlessness or irritability Rapid heart rate Low blood pressure",
    "what_causes_cholera": "Cholera is caused by a bacteria. This bacteria can enter the body after eating or drinking contaminated food or water . If someone has been infected with the bacteria, it will be present in their feces for up to 10 days, even if they do not show any symptoms. Cholera mainly affects people who lack access to safe water and live in environments with inadequate basic sanitary facilities. In places such as slums and camps for displaced persons or refugees, the risk of cholera transmission rises significantly. 1",

    "how_can_cholera_be_diagnosed": "If your healthcare provider suspects that you have cholera after assessing your symptoms, a stool sample will be collected for further analysis. If the organism is detected in the stool sample, the diagnosis can be confirmed. Confirming the diagnosis of cholera is essential, as it can prevent the spread of the disease to others.",
    "what_are_the_possible_treatment_methods_for_cholera": "Cholera treatment should be initiated as soon as possible , as dehydration resulting from watery diarrhea and vomiting due to untreated cholera can be deadly to some within a few hours. If cholera is treated early on, then most people survive. The most important part in cholera treatment is rehydration of the body. This can be achieved by drinking ORS, which consists of a powder containing salts and minerals mixed with uncontaminated water. Another possibility for rehydration is electrolytes and intravenous fluids administered through a vein. If you do not have access to these products, then it's recommended to drink plenty of fluids such as water or broth. People who are severely ill can take antibiotics in combination with rehydration therapy. The antibiotics can help the body fight the bacteria that causes cholera, which decreases the duration of the illness. 4",
    "how_can_cholera_be_prevented": "There are various ways of preventing cholera. Maintaining good hygiene , such as washing your hands with soap, preparing and storing food safely, and disposing of feces safely can help you avoid ingesting the bacteria that causes cholera. Besides that, having access to clean drinking water and basic sanitary facilities is an important factor in preventing cholera. Health organizations play an essential part in the prevention of cholera. In order to rapidly detect and manage outbreaks, health organizations keep track of cholera cases with active surveillance . Additionally, they make sure that access to cholera treatment is readily available , as cholera can be treated easily as long as treatment is initiated early on. If you’re living in an area with endemic cholera, taking a cholera vaccine can also provide protection against cholera. People who travel through these areas are recommended to take Dukoral, which can provide protection against cholera for a period of 2 years. 1",

    "condition": "Chronic Bronchitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-bronchitis/",
    "what_is_chronic_bronchitis": "Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition causing inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes – the airways through which air passes to and from the lungs. People with chronic bronchitis will typically experience a persistent cough that will often bring up mucus. Other symptoms include fatigue, wheezing and shortness of breath. 1 Chronic bronchitis is differentiated from acute bronchitis by its persistent nature. Acute bronchitis – which shares the same symptoms as chronic bronchitis – is a short-term condition that typically fades in two to three weeks, whereas chronic bronchitis is a permanent or constantly recurring condition, most often caused by smoking or the inhalation of irritants or dust. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), bronchitis can be classified as chronic if it affects a person in two consecutive years, over a duration of at least three months each time. Although chronic bronchitis cannot be cured, treatment options are available to manage the condition. 2 If you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.\n\nPeople with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both, are said to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The condition makes it difficult for the lungs to take in air and expel it while breathing, due to the narrowing or obstruction of the airways. COPD is usually caused by smoking. 3",
    "symptoms": "A cough and the production of mucus are the principal symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The severity of the coughing and the amount of mucus produced will differ from person to person, but these symptoms will generally persist for a minimum of three months at a time. Mucus, which is brought up when coughing, may be blood-tinged. Nasal mucus can vary in color, and can be green, yellow or clear. Often, mucus production will be at its height early in the day. 4 Other symptoms of chronic bronchitis include: Nasal congestion Shortness of breath (dyspnea) Wheezing Sore throat Fatigue Headaches Muscle aches The symptoms of chronic bronchitis can on occasion become exacerbated. If this occurs, symptoms will include: Severe coughing and chest pain Blue or grey skin discolouration, typically under the nails High fever If you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.\n\nTo prevent damage to the lungs, it is important to seek medical attention if chronic bronchitis is suspected. Contact a doctor if the following symptoms occur: 5 Symptoms persist for three weeks or longer The condition is disturbing sleep Fever is 100.4 F/38 °C or above Mucus is discoloured Wheezing or shortness of breath occurs Always consult a doctor if there is blood present in mucus; this can be an indication of other serious conditions, such as lung cancer.",
    "causes": "Chronic bronchitis is caused by smoking in the majority of cases. Smoking can cause severe damage to the cilia – the tiny hairs that protect the lungs against germs and mucus – leading to repeated bouts of mucus buildup, as well as inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes. The longer an individual has smoked, the more severe the condition is likely to be. In some cases, chronic bronchitis can be caused by continual exposure to secondhand smoke. Less commonly, chronic bronchitis can also be triggered by the inhalation of irritants such as air pollution, chemical fumes or toxic gas. Repeated exposure to such irritants increases the chances of developing the condition. People with certain underlying conditions, e.g. asthma or cystic fibrosis, as well as those with a genetic predisposition, are more likely to develop the chronic bronchitis. 6",
    "chronic_bronchitis_vs_acute_bronchitis": "The symptoms of chronic and acute bronchitis are very similar, yet their causes and prognoses are quite different. In most cases, the chronic form of the condition is brought about by smoking or exposure to irritants and is permanent. Acute bronchitis, however, is a relatively non-serious and short-term condition that typically develops out of a common cold or the flu and which normally fades within two to three weeks. 7 Read more about Acute Bronchitis »",
    "diagnosing_chronic_bronchitis": "In order to diagnose chronic bronchitis, a doctor will typically begin by inquiring about the symptoms a person is experiencing and performing a full physical examination. For further confirmation, a number of tests may also be ordered. These include: 8 Pulmonary Function Test (PFT): A series of tests to measure lung volume, capacity and other functions that gives doctors a rounded picture of lung health. Chest X-ray: Useful in diagnosing chronic bronchitis and other lung conditions. Sputum examination: Sputum, or mucus, can be tested to determine the cause of mucus buildup. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT): A type of CT scan that allows doctors to image the lungs. If you are concerned that you may have chronic bronchitis, try using the Ada app to find out what the problem is.",
    "chronic_bronchitis_treatment": "There is no cure for chronic bronchitis – it can, however, have its symptoms managed effectively through a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes. 9\n\nA number of medications are available to help manage chronic bronchitis, by treating the symptoms. The chosen treatment route will depend on the severity of the condition. Bronchodilator: A medicinal substance breathed in through an inhaler which helps open up the bronchial tubes and aids breathing. Theophylline: Particularly useful for treating shortness of breath, this oral medication relaxes the muscles in the airways in order to help with breathing. Usually, this is only used under direct medical supervision, in a clinical setting. Steroids: Corticosteroids help bring bring many of the condition’s symptoms under control, specifically by reducing both mucus production and the inflammation of the bronchial tubes.\n\nThere are a number of lifestyle changes that can be made to help manage chronic bronchitis, including: Quitting smoking: Smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis and can help aggravate its symptoms. See below for further information. Avoiding irritants: Those who live in areas with high levels of air pollution, or those who come into regular contact with other airborne irritants should wear a mask or take other steps to avoid them. Use a humidifier: Regular exposure to warm, moist air from a humidifier can be helpful in managing symptoms. Exercise: Ideally for at least 30 minutes, three days per week. Exercise can help strengthen the muscles used to breathe. Those experiencing chronic bronchitis may also benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) , a program designed to help improve the overall well-being of those with respiratory problems. Typically, the program will involve exercise training, nutritional education, breathing strategies and counselling. 10\n\nQuitting smoking is often a very difficult process, but it is vital for treating, as well as preventing, chronic bronchitis. The first step in quitting smoking should be a consultation with a doctor or healthcare provider who will be able to outline the best way to quit, taking into consideration a person’s individual needs and medical history. 11 A combination of behavioral changes and medication is often the most effective way of quitting. Behavioral changes include avoiding situations in which you are around people smoking, or situations in which you would typically smoke yourself, as well as taking steps to avoid stress, such as taking up a new exercise regimen. Learning to recognise cravings and devising methods of counteracting them may also be useful. 11 Several medications are available to aid people in nicotine withdrawal. Some of these are available over the counter, others may require a prescription from a doctor. The overarching name for this method of treatment is nicotine replacement therapy. Medication is available in a variety of forms, including patches, gum and lozenges, and can be effective in reducing the intensity of cravings and gradually weaning people off their addiction to nicotine. 11",
    "chronic_bronchitis_prevention": "Chronic bronchitis cannot always be avoided. However, taking certain steps will lessen a person’s chances of developing the condition. These include: 12 Stopping or never starting smoking: Ideally, smoking should be avoided completely. Those who have already started should stop. Wearing a mask: Avoid irritants in the air by wearing a mask when outdoors. Controlling asthma : Managing the symptoms of asthma may be useful in avoiding chronic bronchitis.",
    "complications_associated_with_chronic_bronchitis": "Complications associated with chronic bronchitis include: 13 Dyspnea: shortness of breath Pneumonia: an inflammatory condition of the lungs Respiratory failure: the inadequate intake of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide in the respiratory system Cor pulmonale: failure of the right side of the heart Pneumothorax: a collapsed lung Polycythemia: increased levels of red blood cells Emphysema: a long-term, chronic condition affecting the function of the air sacs in the lungs Proactively managing the condition can be effective in reducing the risk of complications arising.",
    "chronic_bronchitis_prognosis": "Chronic bronchitis is a progressive condition, meaning it gradually worsens over time. There is no cure, but the prognosis can be significantly improved through managing the condition via medication and lifestyle changes. However, in cases where an individual continues to smoke, where there is a considerable drop in lung function or where complications occur, the prognosis is generally poor, with patients typically given a life expectancy of five years or under. 14",
    "chronic_bronchitis_faqs": "Q: Is chronic bronchitis contagious? A: Chronic bronchitis is not contagious – it is principally caused by smoking or exposure to irritants, meaning that it cannot be passed from person to person. 15 Q: What is the difference between chronic bronchitis and emphysema? A: Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are both types of obstructive pulmonary disease – an umbrella term for lung conditions that affect a person’s ability to breathe. Though the symptoms of each are similar, the way they affect the lungs is significantly different. Emphysema is a condition in which the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs become distended and thereby deteriorate, whereas chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the lungs. 16 Q: How can I tell if my cough is caused by chronic bronchitis? A: A cough caused by chronic bronchitis can typically be differentiated from a cough caused by another condition by its duration and the other symptoms that accompany it. A chronic bronchitis cough will typically persist for at least three months and be accompanied by the bringing up of mucus, which may contain traces of blood and be green, yellow or clear in color. Q: Is chronic bronchitis linked to lung cancer? A: Research suggests that chronic bronchitis is associated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Although the exact reason behind this is not completely clear, cigarette smoking is thought to play a role. 17"

    "what_is_chronic_gastritis": "Chronic gastritis is a long-term condition in which the mucus lined layer of the stomach , also known as the gastric mucosa, is inflamed or irritated over a longer period of time. Symptoms tend to appear slowly, over time. Some of the causes of chronic gastritis include: 1 2 Infection with bacteria of the helicobacter pylori species ( H. pylori ). This cause is by far the most common and is sometimes referred to as Type B gastritis. Damage to the stomach lining , such as that caused by chemical irritation from substances including alcohol, certain painkillers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or bile entering the stomach. A malfunction of the immune system , making it an autoimmune disorder. This is sometimes referred to as Type A gastritis and is the least common cause of chronic gastritis\n\nDepending on the underlying cause, chronic gastritis can generally be treated relatively simply. Chronic gastritis often improves quickly once treatment has begun. Without treatment, chronic gastritis can progress over a number of months to years to the point where the stomach lining is so damaged that the affected person is at risk of: Peptic ulcers Gastric polyps or tumors that may be non-cancerous Anemia , more commonly in cases of autoimmune gastritis Even though the risk remains low, people with untreated chronic gastritis are also at a higher risk than the general population of developing cancerous tumors of the stomach.\n\nAcute gastritis is also an inflammation or irritation of the stomach lining, but one that lasts for a shorter period of time than chronic gastritis. A person affected by chronic gastritis may sometimes not notice many or possibly not even any symptoms and when pain appears, it is typically dull and long-lasting. Acute gastritis tends to set in more quickly, with pain often felt more sharply. 3 Read more about Acute Gastritis »\n\nBoth acute and chronic gastritis directly affect the stomach and may cause nausea and vomiting. Gastroenteritis affects the intestines, as well as the stomach. While nausea and vomiting often result from gastroenteritis, it also very likely leads to diarrhea, which is not a symptom of gastritis. Read more about Gastroenteritis »",
    "chronic_gastritis_symptoms": "A lot of people infected with H. Pylori , which is the main cause of chronic gastritis, do not develop any symptoms for a long time and experience no complications. 2 People who experience symptoms linked to chronic gastritis , rather than its various complications, may experience: 4 Pain or an ache in the upper abdomen A feeling of being full Pain while fasting Pain after eating Nausea Vomiting\n\nPain may not be in the foreground in people with autoimmune chronic gastritis and most will not experience pain as strongly as those with chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs. 5 Some people with autoimmune chronic gastritis may experience a full feeling in the upper abdomen after eating, feel nauseous or vomit. The main resulting condition from autoimmune chronic gastritis is pernicious anemia , caused by a lack of vitamin B12 , due to problems with vitamin B12 absorption due to the effects of the gastritis.  It may also lead to iron deficiency anemia or other conditions, though. 5 6 Symptoms of pernicious anemia may include: 6 7 8 Diarrhea Feeling dizzy or clumsy Feeling tired Shortness of breath, especially when exercising Brittle nails and dry skin Numbness or pins and needles Abnormalities in gait Reduced taste and smell Lack of concentration Psychiatric or cognitive symptoms Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia may include: 9 10 Feeling tired Pale skin Headaches Brittle nails and dry skin Shortness of breath Heart palpitations Tinnitus Read more about Anemia » .",
    "chronic_gastritis_complications": "Chronic gastritis can lead to other conditions if not properly managed. As chronic gastritis may often be asymptomatic, another condition may be the first sign that a person is affected by chronic gastritis. If any of these symptoms seem familiar, try a symptom assessment on the Ada app .  Some of these complications include:\n\nA stomach ulcer is a sore in the lining of the stomach , caused by damage to the stomach lining due to prolonged exposure to gastric acid. Eight out of 10 stomach ulcers, also known as peptic ulcers, are linked to infection with H. pylori . Long-term use of NSAID painkillers is another cause. Symptoms of a stomach ulcer include: 11 12 13 Burning pain in the stomach Nausea and retching Vomiting Bloating or feeling full Belching Heartburn Changes in appetite Unexplained weight loss Difficulty breathing Feeling faint Vomiting blood Blood in stools Stools that appear black or tarry These symptoms usually: 12 14 Appear on an empty stomach Last for minutes or possibly hours Appear on and off over several weeks Can be stopped for a short time by taking antacids Read more about Peptic Ulcer Disease »\n\nIf left untreated, severe chronic gastritis, especially the Type A autoimmune chronic gastritis, as well as the Type B H. pylori chronic gastritis can develop into atrophic gastritis. This is where the protective mucus layer in the stomach is damaged, leading to loss of gastric glandular cells, which is compensated by cells usually found in the intestine. Eventually, gastric glandular cells are replaced by intestinal and fibrous tissue. This process is known as intestinal metaplasia (IM) of the stomach, and those affected are at increased risk of gastric cancer compared to the general population, although the overall risk remains relatively low. 15 16 2 17 Atrophic gastritis is a development of chronic gastritis and the symptoms depend on the specific cause of the condition.For example, atrophic gastritis if due to chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori bacteria may often not cause many, possibly not even any symptoms. Whereas a person with autoimmune chronic gastritis that develops into atrophic gastritis may display symptoms of pernicious (related to vitamin B12 ) or iron-deficiency anemia . See the section above on symptoms to see more signs of chronic gastritis.\n\nGastric polyps are growths that form in the lining of the stomach . They do not usually cause symptoms, but when they do, these can include: 18 19 Anemia Tender stomach when pressed In rarer cases, bleeding Most gastric polyps are benign, meaning non-cancerous , but some can develop into gastric cancers. 20 Seeking medical advice from a doctor is advisable if any of the symptoms of chronic or acute gastritis are experienced. Good to know: The chance of developing cancer from gastritis or atrophic gastritis is low. However, a gastric cancer screening is recommended for people diagnosed with atrophic gastritis at regular intervals. These gaps between screenings will likely be between every one and three years depending on a doctor’s recommendations. 21 22 23 Other effective ways of lowering the chances of gastric cancer include: 24 25 A diet high in fresh fruit and vegetables A diet low in highly processed foods containing lots of salt (sodium) and hydrogenated fats Avoiding red meats, especially  processed, smoked ones containing high levels of nitrate salts and/or nitrite Leading a smoke and nicotine free lifestyle Drinking alcohol only in moderate amounts",
    "what_causes_chronic_gastritis": "If the protective layer of mucus in the stomach is damaged, gastric acids can irritate the stomach lining underneath the mucus . In the great majority of cases, chronic gastritis is caused by the bacteria H. pylori . 16 These bacteria create an inflammation of the stomach lining and, gradually, stomach cells become damaged. Infection with_H. pylori_ is usually acquired in childhood, though symptoms do very often not develop until later in life. Chronic gastritis can also be caused by several chemical substances. These causes include: Repeated, high dose and/or prolonged use of certain pain-relievers such as aspirin, which may also be prescribed for non-pain treatment in lower doses, e.g., after a heart attack, or NSAID drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen- Excessive consumption of alcohol . Bile , a liquid the liver produces to aid digestion, entering the stomach. This is known as bile reflux A small number of cases of chronic gastritis are caused by an autoimmune reaction (Type A chronic gastritis). 26 27\n\nAn autoimmune reaction can also cause chronic gastritis. The body’s autoimmune response causes an inflammation of the protective mucus covered lining of the stomach, which eventually affects and degrades the mucus-producing cells. This leads to fewer mucus-producing cells being available and, consequently, less protection for the stomach. This is accompanied by a loss of parietal cells in the stomach, which regulate stomach acid. Parietal cells also affect absorption of vitamin B12 and iron by the stomach. So damage or loss of these cells may cause the body to have less vitamin B12 and iron available for its various processes and therefore lead to anemia and other deficiency symptoms (see symptom section above). 5 It is not yet known what causes the autoimmune reaction, but people with autoimmune chronic gastritis often also have other autoimmune conditions such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison’s disease or type I diabetes. 5",
    "chronic_gastritis_risk_factors": "Certain population groups and people who overuse certain substances are at increased risk of chronic gastritis: 28 29 30 Habitual use of painkillers such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen can change the composition of the stomach lining, leaving it less protected and causing both acute and chronic gastritis Excessive alcohol consumption is another common risk factor Infection with H. pylori (type B)  is a big risk factor for developing acute as well as chronic gastritis.. Incidences of H. pylori infection have been falling in the developed world since the 1960s, likely due to better hygiene practices",
    "chronic_gastritis_diagnosis": "To assist with the diagnosis of chronic gastritis, a doctor will take the person’s medical history, including their use of medications such as aspirin, NSAID pain-relievers and antacids, as well as alcohol consumption and travel to countries where infection with H. pylori is common. For example, around nine out of every 10 people in Nigeria, Portugal and Estonia are estimated to be infected with H. pylori. 31 . The doctor will also conduct a physical examination of the abdomen/belly. Depending on these factors, a number of tests may be used for helping with diagnosis or evaluating potential causes: 4 Testing for H. pylori . These tests may include a blood, stool or breath tests Blood tests for anemia Blood tests to find antibodies that mistakenly provoke an immune response against cells in a person’s own stomach Liver and kidney function blood tests Stool tests for the presence of blood Other tests may include: EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy), also called gastroscopy or upper endoscopy: An EGD is a visual inspection of the stomach lining, performed by passing an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a lighted camera – down the throat and into the esophagus, stomach and upper small intestine. The doctor can examine the stomach lining for signs of inflammation and take a small tissue sample (biopsy) to test for H. pylori . 32 An EGD is the best diagnostic tool for autoimmune chronic gastritis. 5 Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series: Also called a barium swallow, this test creates a series of X-rays of the GI tract. Swallowing a liquid containing barium (a metal compound) coats the inside of the stomach, esophagus and small intestine to make the organs, as well as any potential ulcer presence, polyps or other abnormality, more visible by X-ray.",
    "how_to_treat_chronic_gastritis": "How chronic gastritis is treated depends on the underlying cause . If the condition is caused by prolonged and excessive use of NSAIDs or alcohol, the person will need to stop taking those substances. A medical professional will be able to assist with replacement painkillers or with any withdrawal effects and also redirect to other needed support, e.g., support groups for quitting alcohol. 26\n\nAntibiotics can treat H. pylori infection. Ridding the body of these bacteria will often cure the gastritis. 4 In the first instance, a combination of three drugs is usually used to  treat H. pylori infection. This treatment will usually include a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a medication that lessens the amount of acid produced by the stomach, as well as two antibiotics. This is known as a triple therapy and the course of treatment runs for between 10 and 14 days. 33 15 In the majority of cases, triple therapy will successfully clear up the infection. If additional treatment is required, then doctors will often recommend a quadruple therapy. This involves a PPI and three antibiotics and also runs for between 10 and 14 days.\n\nChronic gastritis can lead to a change in the stomach lining known as intestinal metaplasia (IM). This is when the cells in the stomach change and become more like the cells in the intestine. IM is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but the risk still remains low. While treating H. pylori infection removes chronic gastritis, it remains unclear whether this treatment will also prove effective at reversing intestinal metaplasia. Evidence suggests that removing H. pylori may at least slow down IM. 34\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment available that will cure autoimmune chronic gastritis. However, the vitamin B12 and iron deficiencies that it often causes can be treated with supplements, in the form of tablets, shots, or intravenous infusions. 5 Even though autoimmune chronic gastritis cannot be removed by treatment, the risk of developing gastric cancer as a complication of the condition is still modestly too low. Nevertheless, a doctor may recommend follow-up endoscopies to detect any early signs of gastric cancer.  Treatment on gastric cancer is generally more effective the earlier the condition is detected and treated. Follow-up endoscopies may be recommended to monitor the development of atrophic gastritis and to detect any early signs of gastric cancer which will allow to then treat it as soon as possible with the best possible outcome.\n\nDiet does not play a role in causing chronic gastritis , though to ease symptoms, people may find it advisable to stop eating things that irritate the stomach, such as fatty, spicy or highly acidic foods. Some people choose to reduce foods containing lactose or gluten. Other lifestyle changes that may help include eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than larger meals, weight reduction and stress management. Over the counter medicines, such as antacids, may ease stomach and digestive symptoms but will not address the underlying problem. Over-the-counter medicines should not be taken often and relied upon. A medical professional should be consulted if symptoms persist for more than a week or are severe.",
    "chronic_gastritis_faqs": "Q: Is there a cure for chronic gastritis? A: Chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori bacteria or by use of NSAIDs or alcohol can be cured by either eliminating the bacteria or discontinuing use of the substance. However, if a person has had chronic gastritis for a long time, some of the damage to the inner stomach lining may be permanent. Q: Is chronic gastritis dangerous? A: Chronic gastritis is itself not dangerous, but can, like acute gastritis, lead to other problems developing, such as ulcers. Furthermore it can develop into a more serious stage. If chronic gastritis progresses to atrophic gastritis it can additionally increase the risk of developing ulcers, anemia, polyps or non-cancerous tumors, and gastric cancers. Q: What is chronic antral gastritis? A: Antral gastritis only affects the lower portion of the stomach, known as the antrum rather than the whole organ. Just like gastritis that affects the whole stomach, antral gastritis can either be chronic or acute. Gastritis caused by H. pylori tends to often be focused in the antrum before spreading to the rest of the stomach. 16 Q: What is the gastric mucosa? A: The gastric mucosa is the internal lining or mucous membrane of the stomach. It is coated by a thick mucus layer and not only produces the acid to break down food entering the stomach, but also protects the stomach from the acid it creates. Gastritis happens when the gastric mucosa is inflamed. Q: How long does chronic gastritis last? A: Chronic gastritis, especially the common types due to H. pylori or due to irritants like alcohol or pain medication, usually improves quickly after proper treatment is started. However, if the condition is left untreated, chronic gastritis can affect a person for many months or even years. Potentially, as in the rarer occuring autoimmune gastritis, it may persist, even despite supportive treatment, for the rest of a person’s life."

    "condition": "Chronic Heart Failure",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-heart-failure/",
    "what_is_chronic_heart_failure": "Chronic heart failure, otherwise known as congestive heart failure or heart failure, is an ongoing inability of the heart to pump enough blood through the body to ensure a sufficient supply of oxygen. The causes of the condition vary, but some of the most common risk factors include old age, diabetes , high blood pressure and being overweight. Chronic heart failure is most common in men. The condition’s name is potentially confusing; the term “heart failure” does not mean that the heart has stopped or is failing completely, but that it is weaker than is normal in a healthy person. In some cases, the condition can be mild, causing symptoms that may only be noticeable when exercising, in others, the condition may be more severe, causing symptoms that may be life-threatening, even while at rest. 1 The most common symptoms of chronic heart failure include shortness of breath, tiredness, swelling of the legs and ankles, chest pain and a cough. It most commonly affects older people and people with other heart conditions and is typically treated with a combination of lifestyle and diet changes, and medications. Chronic heart failure is typically a long-term condition that gradually worsens over time. This is the feature that differentiates it from acute heart failure , which develops very suddenly. It cannot typically be cured, but symptoms can be managed effectively.\n\nThe condition affects the lower chambers of the heart, known as the right and left ventricles. The left ventricle pumps blood around the body, supplying it with oxygen. Chronic heart failure occurs when the heart cannot adapt to the body’s changing need for oxygen, for example when exercising or climbing the stairs. 1 There are different types of chronic heart failure, classified according to how the heart reacts when it pumps. The two main types are: 1 2 Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Also called systolic heart failure or HFrEF, this type occurs when the heart is too weak and doesn’t squeeze normally. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Also called diastolic heart failure or HFpEF, this type occurs when the heart is too stiff and doesn’t fill with blood normally. It is also possible to be affected by a combination of these two types. Moreover, each type of chronic heart failure can affect the left ventricle, right ventricle or both simultaneously.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of chronic heart failure generally depend on the type of the condition being experienced and its location, i.e. which ventricle is involved. 2 The main symptom of left-sided chronic heart failure is shortness of breath, which will generally become worse with activity or when lying flat. A cough may also present. If the condition is affecting the right-side of the heart , edema, a buildup of fluid causing swelling of the legs and ankles, is the most commonly experienced symptom. Other symptoms, which may present regardless of which side of the heart is affected, may include: 1 2 Tiredness Dizziness or lightheadedness Nausea Loss of appetite Constipation Weakness, commonly of the legs Rapid heart rate, even when resting, or an irregular heartbeat Chest pain or angina Doctors generally classify a person’s heart failure according to the severity of the symptoms being experienced. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification system is the commonly used grading system. People are sorted into four categories: 3 I: Physical activity is not limited by symptoms. II: Physical activity is slightly limited. Rest is comfortable. III Physical activity is markedly limited. Rest is comfortable. IV: Unable to carry out physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms are present while resting. People experiencing possible symptoms of chronic heart failure should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes_and_risk_factors": "Chronic heart failure has no single cause; it is most accurately thought of as a complication of a variety of other conditions, each affecting the ability of the heart to pump blood around the body effectively. One of the most common conditions that causes chronic heart failure is coronary artery disease. CHD leads to a narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply the heart with blood and oxygen, depriving it of the oxygen it needs to function effectively. Although chronic heart failure is a common complication of CHD, it does not occur in all cases. Read more about Coronary Artery Disease (CHD) » Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is another common cause. The condition places extra strain on the heart, which can, over time, cause chronic heart failure to develop. Read more about Hypertension » Other possible causes of chronic heart failure include: 2 4 Cardiomyopathy, i.e. diseases of the heart muscle Arrhythmia, an abnormal heart rhythm Diseases of the heart valve Congenital heart conditions Viral infections of the heart muscle, such as myocarditis Medicines and chemicals including some chemotherapy drugs and cocaine Excessive alcohol consumption Anemia Thyroid gland disease",
    "diagnosing_chronic_heart_failure": "Diagnosis is typically based on a person’s medical history, a physical examination and a series of tests. Tests are used by doctors to identify the underlying cause of the chronic heart failure and may include: 1 2 Echocardiogram (ultrasound): This test uses high-frequency sound waves to provide doctors with an insight into the different functions of the heart. It is considered the most important tool in the diagnosis of heart failure. Electrocardiogram (ECG): Used to test and record the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity. Chest X-ray: Able to give doctors a picture of the heart. Can also reveal if there is a buildup of fluid. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP): A blood test to measure BNP or NT-proBNP protein levels, both of which tend to be elevated in people with heart failure. In some cases, other tests, including urine tests and MRI scans, may also be used.",
    "treatment": "Once diagnosed, people with chronic heart failure will work closely with their doctors to create a treatment plan that works for them. In most cases, this plan will include a variety of lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as medications.\n\nLifestyle and dietary changes that are often recommended for people with chronic heart failure include: 1 5 Stopping smoking: People who smoke should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this. Limiting alcohol intake: If a person’s condition was caused by alcohol consumption, they should stop. Doctors are able to advise on the best methods of doing this. Losing weight: If a person is overweight, they should lose weight. This can lessen the strain placed on the heart. Taking regular exercise: Exercise can help to reduce symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. Before beginning a new exercise regimen, however, a person should consult their doctor about how to do this in a safe way. Limiting salt intake: Salt can cause the retention of excess fluid in the body. By managing the amount of salt in one’s diet, therefore, chronic heart failure can be managed. A doctor will advise on how much salt should be consumed. Weighing yourself daily: It is important for people who have been diagnosed with chronic heart failure to weigh themselves daily. If a person’s weight increases by around 2 kg (roughly 4 lb) over a period of 1 to 3 days, they should contact a doctor. This is a sign of fluid retention and may require intervention. People with severe chronic heart failure may be asked to limit the amount of fluid, including water, they consume. Doctors will advise on exactly how much fluid to drink and how to do this in a safe way.\n\nThe type of medications prescribed will depend on the type of chronic heart failure being experienced, its underlying causes and its severity. In many cases, a combination of medications will be necessary; this combination may need to be altered over time, depending on whether hypertension and left ventricular ejection fraction has been controlled and, importantly, whether the affected person is still displaying symptoms. Some of the most common medications prescribed to help manage chronic heart failure include: 2 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can help to prevent a buildup of fluid and may be able to slow the progression of heart failure. Beta blockers: Usually taken in combination with ACE inhibitors, this type of medication can help to protect the heart and slow the progression of heart failure. Diuretics (water tablets): This type of medication helps the kidneys to pass extra urine, helping to ease excess fluid retention. Mineralocorticoid/aldosterone receptor antagonists (MRAs): This type of medication also helps to prevent excess fluid retention. Doctors will advise on how and when to take medications. Reading the enclosed instruction leaflet is also recommended.\n\nIn some cases, alternative treatment methods may be recommended by doctors. Often, these methods will be used to treat the underlying cause of chronic heart failure. Devices, such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and pacemakers, may be fitted in some people. In some severe cases, surgery to replace or fix the affected heart valve may be recommended. In rare cases, a heart transplant or the implantation of a left ventricular assist device may be necessary.",
    "prevention": "A number of measures can be taken to help lessen the risk of developing chronic heart failure. These include: Taking regular exercise, such as walking or swimming Maintaining a healthy weight Maintaining a healthy and nutritious diet with plenty of vegetables and lean meats Limiting alcohol intake Stopping smoking It is also important to address any underlying risk factors, such as high blood pressure and anemia . Doctors are able to advise on how best to manage these conditions.",

    "chronic_heart_failure_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between acute and chronic heart failure? A: Chronic heart failure is generally a condition that develops gradually over time, whereas acute heart failure, in most cases, occurs very suddenly and should be considered a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. The two types of the condition share symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fluid buildup and chest pain, but the pace of their development differs. Read more about Acute Heart Failure » Q: What is the relationship between sleep apnea and chronic heart failure? A: Sleep apnea , as well as other sleep-related disorders, often occur in people with chronic heart failure. 6 Such conditions can place extra strain on the heart during sleep, which can cause heart failure to worsen and may worsen the prognosis for some people. People who have sleep apnea and chronic heart failure should inform their doctor, who will be able to recommend a variety of treatment options. Q: Is chronic heart failure hereditary? A: While it may not be accurate to say that chronic heart failure is hereditary, a number of the risk-factors that can lead to the condition can be hereditary. These include coronary heart disease and high blood pressure. 7 8 As well as a genetic link, it is often the case that family members also share lifestyle and environmental factors which can lead to chronic heart failure. Q: What is the life expectancy for chronic heart failure? A: With prompt and proper treatment, the life expectancy for a person with chronic heart failure can be improved. The prognosis for the condition also greatly depends on the severity of the underlying cause. Chronic heart failure, however, is a serious condition, with, only around 15 percent of people surviving for over 10 years after an occurrence, according to one study. 9"

    "condition": "Chronic Idiopathic Constipation",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-idiopathic-constipation/",
    "what_is_chronic_idiopathic_constipation": "Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is an ongoing condition without any known cause or identified underlying illness. Constipation is a condition which can be defined as a state of unsatisfactory defecation, with characteristic features of infrequent stools and difficulty in passing stools, or both. Eight million people in the US seek medical care for constipation every year, and one million are hospitalized. 2 It is likely that many people who have CIC do not report the condition to their doctors because they are embarrassed or do not see it as a major problem requiring medical care. CIC and Irritable Bowel Syndrome both present as chronic constipation, 2 and are distinct from acute constipation. Acute constipation usually has an organic cause, such as medication or a medical condition, while chronic constipation usually does not, although medication can sometimes play a role. 3 The term idiopathic means that the disorder arises spontaneously, without any known cause. Chronic idiopathic constipation, therefore, is a type of chronic constipation that has no obvious cause. It is a form of functional constipation. CIC is characterized by infrequent stools which are often difficult to pass. It typically affects women and older adults. The typical symptom of this condition is passing fewer than 3 bowel movements per week for more than 6 months. To diagnose CIC, a physician usually excludes all other causes of constipation. The treatment options are limited but include dietary changes and physical exercise.",
    "symptoms": "Infrequent bowel movements and difficulty passing stool, are the most common symptoms. If you experience any of the symptoms listed below more than 25% of the time for six months or more, you may need to be assessed for CIC: 2 4 Straining Hard stools A feeling of incomplete evacuation, i.e. a sensation of stool remaining in the bowel after defecating A feeling of blockage in the anus or rectum Use of manual maneuvers, such as using the hands, to facilitate defecation In addition, a major symptom is having fewer than three bowel movements a week. Good to know: Irritable Bowel Syndrome shares some symptom s with chronic idiopathic constipation, but people with IBS report pain and bloating more often than people with CIC, and report that their symptoms improve after defecation. This is not the case with CIC. People with CIC almost never experience diarrhea without using laxatives. They also experience normal loose stools only rarely.  If you are experiencing uncomfortable symptoms, you can do a symptom assessment using the free Ada app at any time. There are several gastroenterological symptoms which indicate that chronic constipation may have a serious medical condition as its underlying cause, rather than being idiopathic. These include: 2 3 4 Distended abdomen/severe bloating Vomiting Blood in the stool Hematochezia 5 Unintended weight loss Anemia Severe constipation of recent onset Rapid worsening of constipation Family history of colon or rectal cancer These symptoms are more likely to indicate a serious underlying condition in people who are over 50 years of age at the time of symptoms first appearing. Good to know : Constipation is a possible symptom of colorectal cancer , a common gastroenterological cancer that usually affects people who are older than 60 years of age. It is associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis . For more information, see this resource on colorectal cancer. If you or someone you care for are experiencing symptoms that are worrying you, you can do a free symptom assessment at any time using the Ada app .",
    "causes": "CIC is most commonly seen in women and older adults. The causes of chronic idiopathic constipation are largely unknown. However, possible causes include a reduction in fluid and fiber intake in the diet, changes in water balance, and changes in contractility of the colon. There are several different forms of CIC: 4 Normal transit constipation, where the stool may be harder than normal and therefore more difficult to pass, but moves through the colon at a normal speed Slow transit constipation, where stools move through the colon more slowly than usual Disorders of defecation or evacuation Disorders of defecation or evacuation include: 4 Rectocele, a condition where the wall of the rectum bulges into the wall of the vagina inside the body and forms a pouch Rectal prolapse, a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus and becomes visible outside the body Dyssynergic dysfunction Dyssynergic dysfunction arises from problematic co-ordination of the various muscles and sphincters that control defecation. Defecation requires the muscles involved to coordinate the creation  of increasing pressure inside the rectum, followed by relaxation of the internal and external anal sphincters and relaxation of the perineal muscles. This requires the coordination of the pelvic floor muscles, abdominal muscles, and the muscles in the rectum. 4 If these structures do not work together, defecation becomes difficult. People experiencing dyssynergic dysfunction often report a feeling of obstruction and incomplete evacuation. Complications of dyssynergic dysfunction include rectocele, anal fissure and rectal prolapse. In some cases, chronic constipation may be caused by certain medications, such as: 3 Antihistamines Antipsychotic medications Antispasmodic medications Opioids General anesthetics Antiparkinsonian drugs Good to know: Medication-related constipation may be chronic (long-lasting) or acute (short-term), and may improve if use of the medication that is causing it is stopped.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms that a person is experiencing and on conducting a physical examination. To confirm the diagnosis, all other causes of constipation – for example a medical condition, or medication – should be excluded. Doctors who treat constipation are often specialists in gastroenterology. There are various international gastroenterological criteria that help doctors to determine whether CIC, rather than IBS, is present. Some tests that may be done to aid diagnosis include: 2 4 Colonoscopy, in which an endoscopic camera is inserted into the colon, used to identify structural problems. See this resource for more information on preparing for a colonoscopy . Blood tests to check for infection and other disorders. See this resource for more information on blood test results . Colonoscopy is used conservatively. MRI scans are also used sometimes. Good to know: If the person with CIC does not meet the criteria for being at high risk of colorectal cancer, doctors will usually be conservative about ordering diagnostic tests and instead rely on taking a history from the affected person and evaluating their symptoms. Tests such as manometry, motility capsules, Sitz markers and scintigraphy are generally rarely used.",
    "treatment": "As it is not possible to determine the cause of CIC, the treatment options tend to be limited. Dietary changes, like increasing dietary fiber and water intake are usually helpful, as is doing regular physical exercise. However, diet, fluid intake and exercise are not uniformly effective, and some people with CIC may be recommended to use: 2 Fibre supplements such as psyllium, calcium polycarbophil, inulin and maltodextrin Osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose Stimulant laxatives such as bisacodyl, glycerol or sodium picosulfate Laxatives can help with softening stool and improving regularity of bowel movements. Fibre supplements have a similar effect. People who do not find that laxatives provide enough relief from the symptoms of CIC, or for whom laxatives are not recommended, may find serotonin agonists, such as prucalopride or velusetrag, useful. However, the main medications that are recommended when laxatives do not work or cannot be used are lubiprostone (a fatty acid) and linaclotide (an oligo-peptide agonist). These medications work by increasing the amount of chloride that is secreted into the gut, which increases the amount of fluid in the gut, which in turn stimulates bowel movements. 2 One side effect of linaclotide is diarrhea. Otherwise, both drugs are very effective for CIC. People with CIC resulting from dyssynergic dysfunction may find biofeedback useful. (see FAQs ). If done by a trained therapist, biofeedback can be used to correct incorrect defecatory technique and in that way “retrain” the pelvic floor. Probiotics, which replenish or balance the growth of healthy intestinal bacteria, may be helpful for some people.",

    "chronic_idiopathic_constipation_faqs": "Q: How should CIC be treated in children? A: Young children may not be able to describe the symptoms of chronic idiopathic constipation to their caregivers, so it is important to be vigilant for signs of abdominal distress or discomfort in children, especially surrounding bowel movements. Treating constipation in children promptly can prevent it from becoming chronic. Frequent soiling is a symptom of CIC which is specific to children. 6 Children may experience feelings of shame and therefore not report discomfort to their caregivers. In addition, the feelings of discomfort and difficulty during bowel movements may mean that children begin to resist going to the bathroom or withhold stool. CIC in children can arise due to a number of different factors, such as a low-fiber diet and or taking certain medications, that may interact with one another. While the condition cannot be cured, it can be treated. Treatment options include laxatives and enemas, as well as a special individualized diet. Children with CIC may be treated by teams of specialists including gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons and urologists. Q: Do people with CIC need to be hospitalized?? A: People with CIC do not need to be hospitalized in most cases. Treatment procedures such as management of fecal impaction, use of laxatives, the administration of enemas, biofeedback therapy, and the manual management of minor rectal prolapse can all be done as outpatient procedures or at home. 10 However , complications that may arise from CIC, such as moderate or severe rectal prolapse and rectocele may need surgical treatment, and this will involve hospitalization. 11 In very rare cases, people with chronic idiopathic constipation related to obstruction or slow transit may need surgery to remove a portion of the sigmoid colon. 13 14 Q: Are there any home remedies that can help manage chronic idiopathic constipation? A: Taking steps to manage chronic idiopathic constipation at home is possible, and home management often accompanies medical treatment. Weight management, plentiful fluid intake and regular exercise are important in preventing severe constipation. Eating a diet high in fibre is also helpful in most cases. Although it is anecdotally believed that hot coffee beverages can stimulate bowel movements, this has not been conclusively scientifically established. 15 Some people with CIC may find following a low FODMAP diet helpful, as it can reduce bloating, flatulence and cramps, as well as diarrhea or constipation. FODMAP stands for “Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols”, short-chain carbohydrates which are poorly absorbed by the body. It should be noted that a low FODMAP diet is generally considered to be more useful in cases of IBS than CIC. 16 Because FODMAP can become complicated, people who are considering it as a method of managing CIC or IBS should consult a dietitian first. Q: What is biofeedback? A: Biofeedback is a method by which people can learn to control bodily processes that were previously believed to be involuntary or out of their control. Biofeedback can be used to treat symptoms, as well as boost overall wellness. It should be noted that, although it is non-invasive, painless, and usually free of side effects, biofeedback needs to be done by a qualified therapist and requires input and effort from the person receiving biofeedback as treatment. 17 In people affected by constipation, biofeedback is concentrated on learning to voluntarily relax the muscles that govern the opening and closing of the anal sphincter muscles. The process uses a computer, special sensors that are placed inside the body, and verbal reinforcement and encouragement from the therapist. It is usually completely painless. In biofeedback, sensors measure electrical currents produced by the activity of muscles in the affected areas. These currents are displayed as information on a computer monitor. Being able to see muscle movement in an easily-understandable form like this helps the affected person to visualise what is happening inside their body. In this way, they can learn what is happening and how to control it."

    "condition": "Chronic Laryngitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-laryngitis/",
    "what_is_chronic_laryngitis": "Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or last for a longer time. Chronic laryngitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the larynx (voice box) which persists for more than three weeks. Laryngitis may have infectious or non-infectious causes. It can affect people of every age and gender, but is more common in men of middle age. However, an increasing number of women work in industrial environments and/or smoke tobacco, and so the prevalence of chronic laryngitis is rising among women. 1 The main symptom of chronic laryngitis is vocal hoarseness, which occurs due to inflammation of the vocal cords in the throat. When the vocal cords are inflamed, this distorts the sounds made in speech, when air passes over them, resulting in hoarseness of voice.",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Typical symptoms of long-lasting laryngitis include: Vocal hoarseness Sore throat Coughing Swallowing problems",
    "causes": "Laryngeal symptoms such as cough, sore throat and hoarse voice are frequently caused by prolonged irritation of the larynx and vocal cords. If laryngitis persists for weeks or months, this can result in vocal cord strain and injuries and growths or polyps developing on the vocal cords. Non-infectious causes of persistent laryngitis can include: Overuse of the voice, which puts a strain on the larynx Overuse of alcohol Smoking Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bacterial infections Autoimmune disorders Postnasal drip Allergies Surgery or injury to the larynx Cancer Good to know: Bacterial infections rarely cause chronic laryngitis, although MRSA-related chronic laryngitis is becoming more common. 2\n\nMany people who use their voice for a living, such as teachers, call-center employees, singers and lawyers, risk overusing their vocal cords and developing laryngitis as a result. 3 It is possible for prolonged vocal strain to lead to nodules and growths on the vocal cords; these may themselves lead to hoarseness or loss of voice.\n\nCommon commercial alcohol beverages can contain not only ethanol but various other compounds and substances that act as irritants in the throat. Smoke, air pollution and fumes from tobacco products, burning materials, wildfires, industrial processes, chemicals and engines can also irritate the larynx and lead to laryngitis. 1\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of chronic laryngitis. In this condition, acid from the stomach rises up the esophagus and can cause irritation and a burning sensation in the throat and chest. This acid can cause hoarseness and a painful throat (known as pharyngitis . If you are concerned that you may have GERD that is causing a sore throat or hoarseness, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nWhile viral infections rarely lead to chronic laryngitis, bacterial causes are more common. Bacteria that can lead to chronic laryngitis include: 4 Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens Good to know: Chronic laryngitis caused by MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa need to be confirmed by a doctor’s examination and will require antibiotics to treat. 2 Some diseases caused by bacterial infections, such as syphilis , may also cause chronic laryngitis. While fungal infections can cause chronic laryngitis, they are extremely rare in people who have healthy immune systems. People affected by immunosuppressive drugs or who have health conditions that lead to weakened immune systems may, however, be vulnerable to chronic laryngitis as a result of fungal infections. 1\n\nSome autoimmune disorders can also increase the risk of developing chronic laryngitis. These include: 1 Wegener’s granulomatosis Amyloidosis Relapsing polychondritis Systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis",
    "diagnosing_chronic_laryngitis": "Because laryngitis is usually acute, meaning that it goes away on its own after around two weeks, it is wise to seek medical attention if symptoms, including hoarseness of the voice due to inflamed vocal cords, sore throat and/or cough, remain present after this time. The diagnosis of persistent laryngitis is usually made by assessing the symptoms and examining the throat. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have laryngitis, chronic or acute, or another disorder that is causing hoarseness or throat pain, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nIn some cases, a doctor will examine the throat of someone who may have chronic laryngitis with a small instrument known as a laryngoscope. This is often done if the affected person has trouble breathing or swallowing, or earache. 6 There are three types of laryngoscopy: ref6 Indirect laryngoscopy Direct fiber-optic laryngoscopy Direct laryngoscopy In an indirect laryngoscopy, the doctor will use a light and mirror to see the back of the throat and the trachea. This procedure is not painful, although doctors can numb the throat using an anesthetic spray if necessary. In a direct fibre-optic laryngoscopy, also known as a flexible laryngoscopy, a flexible tube with a lens on the end is threaded up the nose and down the throat. Often a decongestant and a numbing spray are used to minimise discomfort. Indirect and direct fibre-optic laryngoscopies do not take very long, sometimes as little as ten minutes. However, a direct laryngoscopy , in which the tongue is pushed down and the epiglottis lifted up, can take up to 45 minutes and is usually performed under general anesthetic. A direct laryngoscopy can be used if the doctor needs to obtain a tissue sample or remove a small growth. 6",
    "treatment": "Treatment for long-lasting laryngitis depends on the source of the issue. If the laryngitis is caused by gastric reflux, that underlying condition should be treated. If the inflammation is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotic medications are normally taken. Aside from addressing the root cause with appropriate medications and/or therapies, treatment for persistent laryngitis mainly involves resting the voice and soothing the throat, to give the larynx and vocal cords a chance to heal. Self-care remedies that may be helpful include: Giving up tobacco products, especially smoking, which can dry out the throat and vocal cords. Choosing non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages, which can dehydrate the body, aggravating laryngeal symptoms. Drinking plenty of water, to thin mucus in the throat, so that it clears easily. This decreases congestion and helps minimise the need to cough. Using natural products that fight infection, like ginger and turmeric extracts. These can be added to hot drinks, can reduce the need to cough and help fight infection. Keeping clean, by using antibacterial handwashes and wipes at regular intervals throughout the day, particularly after coughing. This will also help prevent the transmission of laryngeal infection to others. Avoiding breathing in fumes from smoke or household chemicals, which can cause vocal cord irritation.",
    "preventing_chronic_laryngitis": "Prevention can be achieved by treatment of a gastric reflux condition, avoidance of smoking and smoke exposure, and moderate use of the voice.",
    "other_names_for_chronic_laryngitis": "Infectious or allergic chronic laryngitis Reflux laryngitis Chronic inflammation of the larynx",
    "chronic_laryngitis_faqs": "Q: Can chronic laryngitis indicate cancer? A: Although hoarseness that lasts three weeks or more can be a sign of laryngeal cancer, it is much more likely to be caused by something else. Other potential causes of laryngitis include postnasal drip, allergies, GERD or even thyroid problems . However, if prolonged hoarseness accompanies one or more of the symptoms listed below, the affected person should seek medical assistance: 7 8 A sore throat that does not respond to treatment Constant coughing Shortness of breath Difficulty or pain when swallowing Ear pain Difficult or noisy breathing Feeling of a lump in the throat A mass in the neck Halitosis, or persistent bad breath If you are concerned about cancer or laryngitis in yourself or a loved one, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time. Q: How can a person affected by chronic laryngitis get their voice back? A: Soothing and resting the vocal cords is key for people affected by chronic laryngitis. To do this, affected people should: 3 Stay well-hydratedQuit smoking and avoid secondhand tobacco smoke Keep alcohol consumption to a minimum and preferably cease to drink alcohol entirely and even avoid using alcohol-based mouthwashes Avoid using medication that dries out the mucus membranes Use a humidifier in dry weather or dry climates Maintain a healthy diet Q: How long does chronic laryngitis last? A: The exact duration for which chronic laryngitis lasts depends on the underlying cause and whether it is being treated. However, it is generally agreed that to be categorized as chronic laryngitis, the condition must last for three weeks or more. Q: Is chronic laryngitis contagious? A: Chronic laryngitis itself is not contagious, but some of the underlying bacterial or viral causes may be. Q: Can vaping cause chronic laryngitis? A: Yes, vaping can cause chronic laryngitis, in much the same way that traditional smoking, i.e. using a pipe or cigarettes, does."

    "condition": "Chronic Pancreatitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-pancreatitis/",
    "what_is_chronic_pancreatitis": "Chronic pancreatitis is a continuing, chronic, and irreversible inflammatory process of the pancreas without the possibility of healing , which worsens over time, leading to permanent damage and tissue scarring. The pancreas is the organ behind the stomach, connected to the bowel. It produces enzymes necessary for digestion and helps regulate the body's glucose levels by producing the hormones insulin and glucagon. Symptoms of chronic pancreatitis are pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. The most common causes are chronic consumption of large amounts of alcohol over many years, using tobacco products, autoimmune conditions, and repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes, chronic pain, malnutrition, and, in a small number of cases, pancreatic cancer. 1 Treatment for chronic pancreatitis involves painkillers and fluids, usually given intravenously during hospitalization. Complications arising from this condition can be managed with enzyme and nutritional supplements as well as surgery. Chronic pancreatitis causes around 86,000 hospital stays in the United States each year. 2 Chronic pancreatitis is a serious condition and may be debilitating . It is not curable but can be managed with treatment. The prognosis can be significantly improved by not drinking alcohol .\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a long-lasting condition. Episodes of acute pancreatitis can be fully treated, usually through hospitalization, and will resolve in a few days. Acute pancreatitis is commonly caused by gallstones or by drinking large amounts of alcohol . Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to chronic pancreatitis.",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptom of chronic pancreatitis is very strong pain in the abdomen , often in the mid-abdomen or left upper abdomen area, and that can radiate to the mid-back area. This is comparable to an episode of acute pancreatitis. Pain is usually: 3 4 5 Severe enough to need strong painkillers Initially sporadic but may become continuous Present after eating or drinking Partly relieved by sitting up or leaning forward Around 10 to 15 percent of people with chronic pancreatitis do not experience pain . In these cases, the condition is often discovered by investigating the reasons for significant weight loss. Chronic pancreatitis causes weight loss because the digestive system stops properly absorbing some nutrients following the pancreas no longer producing enough necessary digestive enzymes (malabsorption). A small number of people may report that their pain decreases as the condition progresses, a phenomenon referred to as burn-out. However, most people’s experience of pain is likely to be erratic. 6 Other symptoms of chronic pancreatitis can include: 3 4 Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Greasy-looking, bad-smelling stools Pale or clay-colored stools Weight loss Flatulence Distended abdomen Tiredness\n\nFor some people with chronic pancreatitis, the first noticeable symptoms may actually be caused by complications rather than the condition itself. The pancreas produces enzymes which aid digestion. If a person has chronic pancreatitis, the pancreas may become so damaged that it cannot produce enough enzymes to absorb nutrients from food. This can lead to a condition called malabsorption , which causes symptoms of: 3 7 Weight loss Diarrhea Greasy-looking stools, known as steatorrhea Flatulence The pancreas also produces insulin, which is important for regulating blood sugar. If the pancreas is damaged to the extent that it can no longer produce enough insulin , a person with chronic pancreatitis may develop diabetes . 3 8 Around 6 percent of people with chronic pancreatitis develop a blockage in their bile duct , and 1 to 2 percent will develop a blockage in their small intestine . Both conditions can cause pain, nausea and vomiting, while a blocked bile duct can also cause jaundice. Both conditions may need a surgical bypass. 9 10 Pancreatic pseudocysts develop in 20 to 40 percent of people with chronic pancreatitis, rising to up to 64 percent in people with alcohol-caused chronic pancreatitis. A pseudocyst is a sac filled with pancreatic enzymes, tissue and blood . They form when ducts in the pancreas become blocked. Pseudocysts may become infected, rupture or press on nearby organs. Symptoms of pseudocysts include: 11 12 13 Bloating Abdominal pain Nausea Vomiting Loss of appetite A leaking pseudocyst makes it more likely to develop ascites. Pancreatic ascites is the name for a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity that surrounds the stomach, intestines and liver. It causes abdominal pain and tenderness, a distended abdomen and weight loss. Pancreatic enzymes leaking into the abdominal cavity can directly damage body tissue. 14 Up to 45 percent of people with chronic pancreatitis develop a blood clot in the vein of the spleen . This can lead to internal bleeding and the spleen may need to be surgically removed. Other complications may develop with the spleen because of leaking pancreatic enzymes, owing to the proximity of the spleen and pancreas. These complications include: 15 16 17 Blood clot in the splenic vein Pseudocyst in the spleen Spleen rupture Disruption of blood supply to the spleen, causing damage to tissue Hematoma, a solid swelling of clotted blood, in the spleen Bleeding from damaged parts of the spleen Necrosis, or death of cells, in the spleen People with chronic pancreatitis, particularly post-menopausal women, men over 50 years old and people who also have malabsorption are at risk of developing problems with their bones . Osteopenia and osteoporosis are conditions that are at increased likelihood of developing. 18 19 Chronic pancreatitis increases the risk of developing pancreatic cancer . However, most people with chronic pancreatitis will not develop pancreatic cancer. 20",
    "causes": "Chronic pancreatitis occurs when there is damage to the pancreas that does not heal or improve. There are several causes of chronic pancreatitis . Repeated heavy alcohol use accounts for around 50 percent of chronic pancreatitis cases in the United States . More men than women develop alcohol-related pancreatitis. Using tobacco products is also a risk factor for chronic pancreatitis. 3 21 Genetics may be a cause of some cases of chronic pancreatitis. Around 85 to 95 percent of people with cystic fibrosis will develop some form of pancreas condition , including scarring of the pancreas which can lead to chronic pancreatitis. 22 Autoimmune conditions, where the immune system attacks its own body, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism and sclerosing cholangitis - a rare chronic liver condition - can cause chronic pancreatitis, as can certain genetic mutations. The most common symptoms of autoimmune pancreatitis are jaundice, weight loss and mild pain . Severe pain is unusual in autoimmune pancreatitis. 23 Other causes of chronic pancreatitis include: 4 Blockage in pancreatic duct High levels of fats, known as lipids , in the blood High levels of calcium in the blood Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis In some cases of chronic pancreatitis, the cause is unknown, or idiopathic .",
    "diagnosis": "Chronic pancreatitis can be difficult to definitively diagnose, particularly in the early stages . People with the condition often present with symptoms caused by complications, such as weight loss, pain or greasy stools. Imaging tests and tests for pancreatic function can diagnose chronic pancreatitis, but the results may not point to a conclusive diagnosis in the early stages. 24 Diagnosis will start with taking a medical history and a physical examination. Blood tests may be performed which can also be used to identify or exclude other potential causes for the symptoms, such as problems with the gallbladder or bile duct. 25\n\nThere are various imaging tests for chronic pancreatitis that can provide information about inflammation, scarring and other damage: CT Scan detects changes to the pancreas such as calcification, changes to pancreatic ducts or pseudocysts. CT scans are generally inconclusive in the early stages of chronic pancreatitis but are helpful to rule out other possible causes, such as [pancreatic cancer[(/conditions/pancreatic-cancer/). 3 24 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) , which focus on the area around the pancreas, are more accurate than a CT scan and are good for detecting masses in the pancreas and changes to pancreatic ducts. 3 24 26 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which combines endoscopy and x-rays, to diagnose problems of the bile and pancreatic ducts. As this diagnostic test is invasive, requiring a flexible camera to be inserted into the upper gastrointestinal tract, it is usually performed when a doctor expects to be able to treat a condition at the same time. 27 Endoscopic ultrasound is more invasive than CT or MRI scans, but allows for close-up examination of the pancreas. 3 24\n\nPancreatic function tests check how well the pancreas is working . A person with chronic pancreatitis will produce fewer digestive enzymes and less insulin as the pancreas becomes damaged. Direct pancreatic function tests use an endoscope , which is a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached, to measure levels and stimulate the pancreas to produce enzymes. Direct pancreatic function tests can diagnose most cases of late stage chronic pancreatitis but can miss up to 25 percent of early stage cases. 3 24 Indirect pancreatic function tests measure the effects of chronic pancreatitis . For example, a high level of fat in the stool may indicate malabsorption. Indirect pancreatic function tests include: 3 24 28 29 30 31 Fecal fat test, which measures the amount of fat in the stool Serum trypsinogen test, a blood test that measures trypsinogen, which is produced by the pancreas and converts to the digestive enzyme trypsin Blood tests to measure levels of lipase and amylase, which are other digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas Blood glucose test, which can indicate diabetes Fecal chymotrypsin and elastase tests, which can measure reduced levels of digestive enzymes in the stool These tests are generally better at detecting chronic pancreatitis in its later, rather than early, stages, as they rely on identifying complications of the condition rather than changes to the pancreas itself.",
    "treatment_for_chronic_pancreatitis": "For anyone with chronic pancreatitis, it is very important that they do not use tobacco products or drink alcohol , as this makes the liver deteriorate, leading to further complications which  cause chronic pancreatitis to become worse. As well as not drinking or using tobacco products, it is important for people with chronic pancreatitis to eat a healthy diet that the body can digest . This includes: 1 Limiting the amount of fat Limiting the amount of caffeine Drinking lots of non-alcoholic fluids Making sure to get enough vitamins and minerals Eating small, frequent meals to aid digestion If the pancreas is no longer producing enough digestive enzymes, pancreatic enzyme supplements can help support the digestive system . Supplements for vitamins A, D, E and K can also be helpful for people with malabsorption. For more information, see these resources on vitamin D deficiency and vitamin K deficiency . If a person with chronic pancreatitis has also developed diabetes, they should be referred to an endocrinologist. This type of diabetes is called pancreatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes mellitus . In type 3c diabetes, blood glucose control may be more difficult to achieve. Treatment may vary for people  with chronic pancreatitis as opposed to people with type 2 diabetes . 3 32 Surgery can be used to clear blockages in the pancreatic duct . In serious cases, the pancreas may be partially or wholly removed. If a person still has hormone-producing islets in the liver, these may  be removed and re-inserted into the body to continue producing insulin, without which the person will develop type 3c diabetes. 33 34 Where a person with chronic pancreatitis experiences pain, this can be managed with painkillers . Mild to moderate pain can be managed with painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol. More serious pain may require stronger painkillers. 3 35 Episodes of acute pancreatitis will often require a stay in hospital, to be treated with: 1 33 Fluids administered intravenously Painkillers Drugs to reduce nausea and vomiting Feeding by tube or intravenously if the person cannot eat Antibiotics if the person has an infection in the pancreas",
    "preventing_chronic_pancreatitis": "Drinking alcohol and using tobacco products are risk factors for developing chronic pancreatitis. The risk of developing chronic pancreatitis is reduced by avoiding alcohol and tobacco products. Repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis increase the risk of developing chronic pancreatitis. It may be possible to reduce or avoid episodes of acute pancreatitis by stopping drinking alcohol and eating a healthy diet; this can help prevent episodes of acute pancreatitis caused by formation and interruption of the normal flow of the pancreatic duct fluid by gallstones.",
    "other_names_for_chronic_pancreatitis": "Pancreatic insufficiency - chronic",
    "chronic_pancreatitis_faqs": "Q: Can chronic pancreatitis go away? A: No. Chronic pancreatitis means that problems with the pancreas will not improve and leads to permanent damage. Careful management of the condition can make it easier to live with. Acute pancreatitis, on the other hand, is a form of pancreatitis that lasts a few days and then goes away. Q: Is chronic pancreatitis fatal? A: Chronic pancreatitis is a serious illness and, in some cases, can be fatal. A small number of people with chronic pancreatitis will develop pancreatic cancer, which can be fatal. Small numbers of people with chronic pancreatitis may die from complications following surgery or from a digestive hemorrhage. Another complication of chronic pancreatitis is diabetes, which may reduce life expectancy. If a person with chronic pancreatitis drinks alcohol and smokes they will likely have a poorer life expectancy. However, up to 80 percent of people with chronic pancreatitis will have a life expectancy of at least 10 years after the initial diagnosis. 36 Q: Can you drink alcohol with chronic pancreatitis? A: A person with chronic pancreatitis should not drink alcohol. Continuing to drink alcohol will cause pain and damage the pancreas even further. Drinking alcohol makes the person’s overall prognosis worse and increases the risk of developing complications such as diabetes and pseudocysts. Life expectancy is reduced for people with chronic pancreatitis who continue to drink alcohol. 36 37"

    "what_is_chronic_pelvic_pain": "Chronic pelvic pain, or chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is a long-term condition characterized by abdominal pain in the area below the belly button . To be classed as chronic, the pain must be present for at least six months and be severe enough to require treatment or cause functional disability. 1 Chronic pelvic pain can affect men, but is most common in women. This resource, therefore, will primarily focus on the condition in women. 2 There are many possible causes for pelvic pain, including underlying medical conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease and irritable bowel syndrome , as well as nervous system dysfunction. 1 The condition is also associated with social and psychological factors, including physical and mental abuse. 3 Often, when there is no obvious cause, diagnosis can be difficult, leading to a delay in treatment which can lead many people with chronic pelvic pain to feel dissatisfied or frustrated. This resource will focus on the condition in women.",
    "symptoms": "The most typical symptom of chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below the belly button, which must last for a period of at least six months to be considered chronic. The specific characteristics and location of the pain typically differs from person to person. Some women describe the pain as constant, while others see it come and go, sometimes triggered by menstrual periods or activities such as eating or heavy lifting. The pain may be stabbing in sensation and focussed on a specific area, or it may be dull and spread out over a wider area. In many cases, the severity of the pain is enough to cause significant distress and interfere with normal activities, such as going to work, exercise and sexual activity. 4 How the pain feels and when it occurs are often helpful factors in identifying the cause of the pain. Other possible symptoms of chronic pelvic pain include: Abdominal tenderness Pain or difficulty while urinating A feeling following urination that the bladder has not been completely emptied Waking frequently during the night with the need to urinate Pain or difficulty during sexual intercourse Pain during menstruation, normally accompanied by abdominal cramps Headaches Other symptoms related to the underlying cause of the pain may also occur in some people. People experiencing possible symptoms of chronic pelvic pain should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The pelvis is the lowest portion of the abdomen, containing a number of organs and complex layers of muscles, nerves and blood vessels. The pain associated with the condition can originate from any part of the pelvis. The reasons why some people develop chronic pelvic pain are not well understood. However, a number of conditions affecting the reproductive organs, digestive tract, urinary system, muscles and nerves have been associated with chronic pelvic pain. In some cases, psychological factors may also play a role. 1 5\n\nIt is estimated that 20 percent of women experience chronic pelvic pain as a result of an underlying condition or problem linked to the reproductive system. Possible gynecologic causes include: 1 Endometriosis Uterine fibroids Adenomyosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Pelvic adhesive disease While pregnancy may cause pelvic pain that lasts for over six months, this is not classed as chronic pelvic pain by medical professionals. Due to difficulties in defining the disorder, some doctors also exclude endometriosis as a cause of chronic pelvic pain. Good to know: Endometriosis is often cyclic in nature, while CPP is not generally considered to be cyclic.\n\nOther, non-gynecologic causes of chronic pelvic pain include: Irritable bowel syndrome Painful bladder syndrome and interstitial cystitis Diverticulitis Pelvic pain dysfunction Abdominal myofascial pain Fibromyalgia\n\nIn some cases, psychological problems may contribute to the onset of chronic pelvic pain. Moreover, it is thought that the psychological stress that can often result from chronic pelvic pain may help to perpetuate the condition. Possible psychological factors associated with chronic pelvic pain include: 2 3 5 Physical, mental or sexual abuse Depression Anxiety",
    "diagnosing_chronic_pelvic_pain": "Due to the high number of possible causes of the condition, it can often be difficult to identify the exact source of the pain. A doctor will typically first inquire about the affected person’s symptoms, their medical history and carry out a physical examination. At this stage, the affected person may be required to fill out a symptom questionnaire, as well as undergo a single digit or bimanual vaginal examination. If there is no obvious cause of the condition after the initial stage of diagnosis, a number of diagnostic tests will typically be carried out. 2 These tests may include: 1 6 Laboratory tests: Such as a blood test, e.g. a white blood cell count , and a urine test. Pelvic ultrasound: In which sound waves are used to examine the organs and structure of the pelvic region. Pelvic MRI: Magnets and radio waves are used to create an image of the pelvis. Pelvic laparoscopy: A procedure involving the insertion of a small, wand-like instrument containing a camera into the pelvis, allowing doctors to view its interior. Although usually considered routine, this procedure does pose risks to the affected woman. In some cases, tests may not be able to identify the cause of pelvic pain. Although this can make treatment more difficult, it does not rule out treatment altogether. In situations such as these, treatment will be focussed on managing the symptoms rather than treating the underlying cause.",
    "chronic_pelvic_pain_treatment": "There is no single way of treating chronic pelvic pain. Treatment will be tailored to the individual and depend on the underlying cause of the condition, its severity and its frequency, and will often involve a number of different methods.\n\nPain relief medication will often be recommended to those affected by chronic pelvic pain. At first, over-the-counter medications, including ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin, may be effective. Later, stronger prescription medications may be prescribed by a doctor. Some women may benefit from use of antidepressants. 7\n\nPhysical therapy can help manage the pain in some cases. Methods include the use of hot and cold applications, stretching and positioning techniques, massage, nerve stimulation and pelvic floor training. 7 8\n\nSome causes of pelvic pain may respond well to surgical treatment. This may involve the removal of the endometrium, a hysterectomy to remove the uterus or a presacral neurectomy, a procedure to remove a group of nerves responsible for sending pain signals from the uterus to the brain. 1 There is no guarantee that surgery will be effective, and it is usually only considered if the condition has not responded to any other treatment methods.\n\nSome women may find that counseling is effective in helping to manage the symptoms of chronic pelvic pain. This may involve one-on-one psychotherapy with a trained psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker, group therapy with other people affected by the same or a similar condition or online or local support groups. Relaxation techniques and biofeedback, a method by which people can learn to control bodily processes that were previously believed to be involuntary or out of their control, may also be effective in some cases. 1",
    "chronic_pelvic_pain_prognosis": "Typically, chronic pelvic pain can be effectively managed, but not completely cured. In many cases, the condition may go into remission for a period before once again returning, making long-term treatment necessary. In people who have undergone surgery to manage the condition, pain may still recur, owing to other, undiagnosed sources of pain. Pain may also occur in other areas, such as the lower back or legs, owing to a predisposition to the excessive perception of pain in some people.",
    "chronic_pelvic_pain_faqs": "Q: Can men experience chronic pelvic pain? A: Yes, men can experience chronic pelvic pain. In men, the condition is known as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS). The key symptom is pain in the pelvic area, usually centered around the penis, scrotum and perineum. Generally, the pain must be experienced for at least three months to be diagnosed as chronic. The cause of the condition is not yet fully understood. Nerve problems, prostate infection and autoimmune problems have all been suggested as causes, but there is no medical consensus on the issue. Because of this, treatment can be difficult, and most men will be required to consult a specialist. 9"

    "condition": "Chronic Pharyngitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-pharyngitis/",
    "what_is_chronic_pharyngitis": "Also known as a persistent sore throat, chronic pharyngitis differs from acute pharyngitis in that it lasts for a considerably longer time and does not respond to treatments for acute pharyngitis. Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the back of the throat, the pharynx. Acute pharyngitis is more common, and symptoms usually resolve within ten days. 1 Treatment for acute pharyngitis is usually focussed on treating the symptoms. Most cases of acute pharyngitis are viral, but some are bacterial. Antibiotics are only helpful if bacterial infection is the cause for acute pharyngitis. But even if it clearly is bacterial, which can sometimes be hard to tell, antibiotic treatment is not necessarily recommended for all patient groups. However, chronic pharyngitis can be caused by a number of different factors besides infection. In chronic pharyngitis, the soreness either does not go away or recurs frequently. Pharyngitis may be chronic if the sore throat lasts for more than a few weeks. There are several underlying causes for chronic pharyngitis, and treatment depends on what the underlying cause is.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of chronic pharyngitis resemble those of acute pharyngitis, and include: 2 3 Discomfort or pain in the throat Cough Hoarseness A tickling sensation in the throat A sensation of something stuck in the throat Difficulty swallowing A tired voice, more common among people who sing or speak for a living Headache Fever",
    "causes": "Chronic pharyngitis has many potential underlying causes, and if a sore throat does not clear up even after a course of antibiotics, it is best to seek further medical advice. Chronic pharyngitis may be caused by factors such as: Smoke or environmental pollutants Infection Allergies or allergic reactions, such as eosinophilic esophagitis Acid reflux Throat cancer, in rare cases\n\nSmoke contains fine particles of solid, gas and liquid matter carried in air, and may include harmful chemicals as well as fragments of burnt material. 4 Smoke may be generated by burning tobacco, wood, grass, coal, plastic, structures, burn pits, landfill fires, traffic exhaust, industrial exhaust or almost any other combustible material or activity that involves carbon combustion. 5 The exact chemicals and particles carried in smoke depend on what is producing the smoke. Fine particle pollution is a common problem in urban areas as well as in households and undeveloped areas that rely on wood and coal fires for heat and/or cooking. The degree to which smoke and other airborne environmental pollutants can cause throat pain and lung problems varies from person to person, but, when problems occur, they commonly manifest as a dry, sore throat, runny nose and coughing. 6 Long-term or frequent exposure to smoke can cause persistent pharyngitis.\n\nAnother common cause of persistent sore throat is an infection of the structures in or surrounding the throat. In people who still have their tonsils, these are the structures most often affected. This is known as tonsillitis , and other symptoms that may be present include: 7 8 Cough Fever Nausea and vomiting Painful swallowing Swollen lymph glands Headache Abdominal pain\n\nAllergic rhinitis is also known as hay fever and is a condition in which the body’s immune system responds aggressively to harmless particles such as pollen, mold or pet dander. Depending on what triggers the immune response, allergic rhinitis can cause symptoms seasonally or all year. 9 In allergic rhinitis, the body responds to the allergen by releasing histamines, which cause the lining of the sinuses, eyes and nostrils to become inflamed. Nasal congestion, sneezing, postnasal drip and an itchy throat are all common symptoms of allergic rhinitis. 10 See this resource on hay fever for more information. Good to know: In postnasal drip, the mucus glands of the nose and throat produce excessive amounts of thick mucus, which can cause the pharynx to feel swollen and irritated. 11 Postnasal drip and the itchy, painful throat associated with allergic rhinitis can both cause a recurring or constant sore throat.\n\nLaryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a disorder associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) , in which reflux of digestive acids from the stomach reaches the back of the throat and the nasal airway. In adults, the symptoms include: 12 Burning sensations or pain in the throat. Hoarseness. Postnasal drip. Difficulty swallowing. A sensation of something stuck in the throat.\n\nLPR can be caused by dietary problems, abnormalities of the sphincters of the esophagus and being overweight. In many cases, certain foods may be associated with LPR. These include: 13 Alcohol Caffeine Fatty foods Spicy foods Stress and smoking can also cause LPR. It is possible to have LPR without having GERD, or to have GERD without having LPR.\n\nEosinophilic esophagitis is a disorder of the esophagus, in which allergic reactions cause the esophagus to become irritated and sometimes to narrow. 14 . This irritation may result from food allergies or environmental allergies.It is not possible to diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis using standard allergy tests, and it is difficult to pinpoint which foods are causing the problem, as allergic reactions are often delayed in this disorder. 15 Symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis include: 14 15 Throat pain Heartburn Difficulty swallowing, especially dry or dense foods. Painful swallowing Recurring abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Food becoming lodged in the narrowed esophagus. Children with this disorder may refuse to eat, fail to thrive or vomit after meals, in addition to the above symptoms. Food becoming lodged in the esophagus (food impaction) is a medical emergency in children and adults, and if it occurs, medical help should be sought immediately.\n\nThroat cancer is a fairly rare cause of chronic sore throat, but is nevertheless quite serious should it occur. Throat cancer generally begins in the larynx (voice-box) or the pharynx, 16 and throat pain is only one of a number of symptoms. Other symptoms include: ref14 17 Difficulty swallowing Sore throat Shortness of breath Chronic cough Changes in the voice/hoarseness Feeling of something stuck in the throat Lumps in the neck or throat Swelling of the neck Bleeding in the mouth or nose Unplanned, unexplained weight loss The most important risk factors for throat cancer are smoking and alcohol consumption. 16 17",
    "diagnosis_and_treatment": "Chronic pharyngitis often indicates the presence of an underlying problem, and treatment to relieve it includes treating the underlying cause. To relieve the sore throat itself, people with chronic pharyngitis can gargle with warm saline solutions, stay well-hydrated, avoid smoking and manage pain with over-the-counter medication such as acetaminophen/paracetamol. However, the underlying cause must be addressed. In cases of chronic pharyngitis caused by smoke or environmental pollutants , the person must be removed from the environment where the smoke is present. Tonsillitis is generally treated with an intensive course of antibiotics. If the disorder recurs often, or is particularly severe, tonsillectomy may be considered. A tonsillectomy is a relatively minor surgical procedure and is not associated with much postoperative pain. 7 For more information, see this resource on tonsillitis . Allergic rhinitis is often treated with nasal sprays, saline sprays and over-the-counter allergy medications. 18 In more severe cases, an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist should be consulted. For more information, see this resource on allergic rhinitis . Laryngo-pharyngeal reflux can be treated with lifestyle changes to remove triggers, such as stress and excess weight, dietary changes and medication. Proton-pump inhibitors, such as esomeprazole or omeprazole are often the first-line medications used to treat LRP in cases where lifestyle changes do not seem to be sufficient. 19 People whose LPR is the result of physical abnormalities in the esophagus may need surgery to alleviate the disorder. Eosinophilic esophagitis is usually diagnosed by a gastroenterologist or an ENT specialist and is treated with elimination or elemental diets to isolate and then remove the food triggers. Alongside the diet plan, symptoms may be treated with corticosteroids, 14 and proton-pump inhibitors. 15 Throat cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer, its location, and how advanced it is. 16 If a diagnosis of throat cancer is confirmed, treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgery results in cure for up to eight in ten cases of early-stage throat cancer 20 , while radiotherapy is also often successful. In some cases, surgery and radiotherapy may be used in combination. ref19"

    "condition": "Chronic Renal Failure",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/chronic-renal-failure/",
    "what_is_chronic_renal_failure": "Chronic renal failure is a condition involving a decrease in the kidneys' ability to filter waste and fluid from the blood. It is chronic, meaning that the condition develops over a long period of time and is not reversible. The condition is also commonly known as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Chronic renal failure is typically caused by certain other medical conditions that put strain on  the kidneys over time, including diabetes, high blood pressure or hypertension, and long-term inflammation of the kidneys. Early symptoms of reduced kidney function include urinating more frequently, high blood pressure, and swelling of the legs.\n\nAround 15 percent of adults, or 30 million people in the United States, are thought to have kidney disease at some stage. Because the condition takes some time to develop, it most commonly affects older people. Women are affected slightly more often than men, and people of African, Latin American, and Native American descent are at higher risk of CKD. 1 People who are at risk of chronic renal failure should have regular health checks, which include evaluating the glomerular filtration rate. This is a more reliable method of diagnosing the early stages of chronic renal failure than waiting for symptoms to appear. Treatment consists of managing the underlying condition and supporting kidney function. Chronic renal failure requires careful, lifelong management and can progress to end-stage kidney failure which requires dialysis or transplant. However, many cases of chronic renal failure are mild to moderate and can be managed by patients with support from a doctor. 2",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "In the early stages of chronic renal failure, affected people often do not experience any symptoms. However, symptoms that may emerge during the early stages of chronic renal failure include: 3 4 The urge to urinate more frequently Urine may be pale and foamy Hypertension , also known as high blood pressure Swelling of the legs Poor appetite Weight loss. As the condition progresses, affected people may develop other symptoms such as: 3 4 5 6 Muscle cramps or twitches Developing brown spots on the skin Worsening of swelling, including on the hands, ankles, feet and around the eyes Drowsiness or lack of concentration Feeling lethargic and without energy Bruising easily Blood in the stool Amenorrhea (periods stopping) Itchy, dry skin Pain in the bones Increased susceptibility to infection Nausea and vomiting.",
    "what_causes_chronic_renal_failure": "Chronic renal failure mostly occurs in people who have other medical conditions which cause damage to the small units in the kidneys, called nephrons, which are responsible for filtering waste and fluid from the blood. Common conditions which can cause chronic renal failure include: 1 Diabetes . One in three adults with diabetes is likely to develop chronic renal failure Hypertension . One in five adults with high blood pressure is likely to develop chronic renal failure People with diabetes and hypertension, who are at high risk of developing chronic renal failure, should have regular health checks to measure their glomerular filtration rate. Diabetics should also have regular microalbumin tests. These tests can detect early signs of the condition. Less common conditions that can cause chronic renal failure include: 4 7 8 Polycystic kidney disease, a range of genetic disorders Nephrotic syndrome , also called nephritis and glomerulonephritis, is a condition that damages the glomeruli 9 and can be caused by strep throat and lupus, among other conditions Inflammation of the kidneys Repeated kidney infections and frequent kidney stones . People who have some malformation of their kidneys or urinary tract are at higher risk of eventually developing chronic renal failure. Once the kidneys have lost a significant amount of function, they may not be able to recover, and the person may progress to end-stage renal disease.",
    "chronic_renal_failure_diagnosis": "Chronic renal failure can be diagnosed by measuring kidney function and is typically tested for by taking blood and urine samples to measure creatinine levels. This is a waste product of creatine, which is a chemical the body produces to supply energy, primarily to muscles and the brain. 10 The two main diagnostic tests are: 11 12 13 Glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Checks how well the glomeruli 9 are working. To check the filtration rate, a blood sample is taken, which is then tested in a lab. The results are combined with factors including age, ethnicity, gender, height, and weight to estimate a person’s glomerular filtration rate. Creatinine clearance test. Another way of calculating the glomerular filtration rate. To perform the test, a person needs to collect all their urine for a 24-hour period and then provide a blood sample. Comparing creatinine levels in the blood and urine allows a person’s glomerular filtration rate to be estimated. If a person has a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60mL/min/1.73m2 for three months or more, they are classed as having chronic renal failure or kidney damage. 14 Normal results are in the 90mL/min/1.73m2 to 120mL/min/1.73m2 range. 11 Additionally, an ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract may be necessary. In some cases, it may be necessary to take a small sample of the kidney, called a biopsy, in order to find the underlying cause for the condition. 4 Diabetics should have regular microalbumin tests in addition to other tests. This test is used to detect very small levels of albumin, a protein usually found in the blood, in the urine. If the kidneys are damaged, albumin leaks into urine. 15",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_chronic_renal_failure": "Treatment involves controlling the condition that is harming the kidneys. In particular, people with hypertension or diabetes should make sure that these conditions are well controlled. Keeping blood sugar and blood pressure under control will slow down further kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred option for managing hypertension. 3 Other medical conditions involving the kidneys can be managed with the help of a nephrologist (a specialist kidney doctor). If chronic renal failure is diagnosed early and carefully managed, this may help to prevent the condition from worsening and progressing to end-stage renal failure. People with kidneys that no longer work well enough to filter blood and fluid may need dialysis, a process in which the blood is cleaned by a machine. Everyone with end-stage renal failure should be evaluated for a kidney transplant. 5 3",
    "prevention": "Good control of medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes is important in preventing chronic renal failure. Other actions that can help prevent chronic renal failure include: 5 16 Regular health check-ups, including evaluation of kidney function in high-risk populations Losing weight Taking regular exercise which can help regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels Eating a healthy diet Stopping smoking Drinking less alcohol Taking all prescribed medication as directed Avoiding certain over-the-counter painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen.",
    "complications": "If kidney disease progresses, it can lead to kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal disease. This means that the kidneys will no longer be able to process waste and remove it from the body. This will require dialysis or, potentially, a kidney transplant. 3 4\n\nAnemia is a common condition in people with chronic renal failure that tends to occur after a person loses 20 to 50 percent of kidney function. Damaged kidneys do not produce enough of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO), which promotes the creation of red blood cells. 17 Read more about Anemia »\n\nPeople with chronic renal failure do not process vitamin D as efficiently as people with healthy kidneys and are at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

    "condition": "Cluster Headaches (CHs)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cluster-headaches/",
    "what_are_cluster_headaches_chs": "Cluster headaches (CHs) are a relatively uncommon headache disorder . This kind of headache affects people in bouts (clusters), over periods of weeks or months. According to the World Health Organization, CHs affect around one in a thousand people. They primarily affect adults, and the first episodes usually begin to appear during a person’s 20s or thereafter. The most notable characteristic of CHs is the unprecedented intensity of the pain which those affected experience during a headache attack. Cluster headaches are described as one of the most painful types of headaches. The exact causes of cluster headaches are unknown, but they are six times more likely to affect men than women. 1 Currently identified possible triggers include stress, exposure to allergens and heavy alcohol use.\n\nAn affected person may experience bouts (clusters) of 1-8 headaches per day, also known as cluster periods, for intermittent periods of time lasting weeks or months, usually followed by remission periods when the headaches stop. During remission, no headaches occur for months and sometimes even years. The cycles might be in step with the changing of the seasons. However, some chronic,year-round, presentations of the condition do not seem to have any connections to seasonal or environmental triggers. 2 Although CHs are incredibly painful, they are not life-threatening, and treatment can reduce the frequency and severity of the headaches. In the short term, treatment for cluster headaches focuses on lessening the symptoms of the headache attack. This usually involves specialized painkillers and/or oxygen therapy, i.e.inhaling pure oxygen through a face mask. Long-term treatment of CHs focuses on lifestyle changes and prevention.",
    "symptoms": "CHs are a subtype of headache called trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC). Headaches of this kind are unilateral, meaning that they affect one side of the head and face: 3 Cephalalgia is the medical term for a dull, persistent, and usually moderately intense, pain in the head region. Trigeminal refers to the trigeminal nerve, responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. Correspondingly, the area affected by CHs is the facial area and the eye area in particular. CHs can affect either the left or the right side of the head, but most people find that they are usually affected on the same side each time. Autonomic refers to the fact that the body performs the symptoms of CHs automatically, e.g. a runny nose and teary eyes. Cluster headaches are associated with pain which develops very suddenly and is incredibly intense. It has been described as an unbearable, piercing, burning, and excruciating sensation. 2 The intensity of the pain may cause people to move in an agitated manner during a CH attack. It is common for people to pace up and down during a headache attack, and some people even report making desperate attempts to bang their heads on walls and objects in response to the intensity of the pain. In addition to its characteristic pain, one or more of the following symptoms may be present during a CH: 2 4 A reddened, teary eye Shrinking of the pupil in the eye A drooping or swollen eyelid A blocked and/or stuffy nostril When they occur, these symptoms will be located on the side of the head affected. Other symptoms of CHs which may be present during an attack include: A sweaty face and forehead A pale or flushed face Restlessness (pacing and agitated movement) Spreading of the pain to the face, head, neck and shoulders A need to avoid light and sound Many people only experience one or two of these symptoms in addition to the painful sensation, and it is possible for a person’s symptoms to vary between attacks. However, most people’s symptoms only vary very slightly from one headache attack to another. 5",
    "duration_and_frequency": "The natural duration of a cluster headache is usually approximately between 15 minutes and three hours, if there is no specialized treatment to reduce its pain and duration. CHs usually occur one to eight times per day, at the same time or times. It is most common for CHs to occur at night, one to two hours after falling asleep, waking up the affected person. 6 After the headache, the pain usually alleviates very suddenly, leaving the affected person pain-free, and, usually, physically tired.\n\nIn people with episodic cluster headaches, CHs will occur every day for periods of weeks or months; six to twelve weeks is normal. This is the case in around 80 percent of people affected by CHs. 7 The rest of the time, a person affected by episodic CHs will experience periods of remission with no CHs. These periods of remission may last months or even years before the next cycle of headaches occurs. Periods in which CHs occur, will usually happen at the same time or times each year. Many affected people experience CHs during Spring and Fall.\n\nFor 20 percent of people affected by CHs, the condition is chronic, meaning that the headaches occur all year round rather than in periodic or seasonal cycles. CHs are considered chronic if a bout of CHs lasts for more than a year and/or if periods of remission typically last for less than one month. 7",
    "causes": "Only a small amount of information about the physiological mechanism that leads to cluster headaches is known. CHs are linked to increased activity in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which contains a control center for many of the functions of the autonomic nervous system. A greater intensity in the activity of the hypothalamus during CH attacks has been detected by brain imaging studies on people affected by CHs. 8 However, the exact relationship between CHs and the activity of the hypothalamus is not yet understood. They are also been linked to a person having elevated levels of histamine, a chemical produced as part of the body’s immune response to allergens. According to historical research into cluster headaches, people affected by CHs are likely to develop a headache attack when histamine is medically administered. 9 A person’s food intake may contain histamine-rich foods, which can cause CHs. Histamine levels in foods vary, depending on how processed, ripe or matured they are. Foods that are rich in histamine and may cause CHs include salty foods such as crisps and cured meats, alcohol, vinegar, cocoa and chocolate, shellfish, beans and pulses, and matured cheeses. Keeping a food diary may help to identify foods that are causing CH bouts or attacks. Furthermore, having elevated levels of serotonin , a neurotransmitter has also been linked to CHs. Serotonin is mainly produced in the brain and is found in the nervous system and gut. It promotes feelings of well-being. However, the relationships between having elevated levels of histamine and/or serotonin and the development of CHs are also unknown.\n\nHowever, it is important that people who are using SSRIs inform their doctor when seeking treatment for CHs: SSRIs have cross-reactivity with certain medications used to treat CHs. For example, the first-line treatment for CHs, sumatriptan, from the triptan class of medications, works by stimulating serotonin receptors in the brain. The stimulation of the serotonin receptors resulting from the use of triptans has an effect called negative feedback regulation on the brain’s 5-HT synthesis. This effect leads to a larger than normal amount of serotonin being available for use by the brain. Due to this effect, triptans may cause serotonin syndrome when used in conjunction with SSRIs. Serotonin syndrome is a condition involving high body temperature, sweating and tremors, occurring as a result of too much serotonin in the body.",
    "what_triggers_cluster_headaches": "In people who are affected by cluster headaches, certain triggers have been identified which may bring on a bout of cluster headaches. These factors have also been found to trigger headache attacks during a period when a person is experiencing a bout of CHs. Known triggers of CHs, in people already affected by the condition, include: 4 11 Seasonal changes - CHs are believed to be linked to circadian rhythmicity and are therefore likely to occur as the body adjusts to taking in more or less light during the day: a property of the shoulder seasons rather than the extreme ones. Weather changes Exertion Drinking alcohol Smoking tobacco Stress Exposure to allergens, such as pollen and pet dander Strong smells, such as paint, petrol or perfume Temperature changes - hot towels, hot showers High altitudes - air travel, trekking Nitroglycerin, a chemical compound which is used in some medications for chest pain Foods high in nitrates, e.g. preserved meats Elevated levels of histamine Elevated levels of serotonin Cocaine",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_cluster_headaches": "The exact cause of cluster headaches is unknown, but certain factors render a person at increased risk of developing cluster headaches. These include: Being male Using tobacco products; however, quitting using tobacco products is not known to affect a person’s chances of developing the condition Drinking alcohol Being older than 20 Previous trauma or surgery to the head A family history of cluster headaches Research investigating CHs in various population groups has reliably identified that a small proportion ‒ up to 20 percent ‒ of participants have relatives who are also affected. A significant proportion of people who develop cluster headaches use tobacco products and/or consume alcohol heavily.",
    "cluster_headaches_diagnosis": "Anybody who thinks they may have experienced a cluster headache should seek medical attention without waiting for a repeat occurrence. To reduce the potential severity and overall impact of CHs on a person’s quality of life, it is important to diagnose and begin treating the condition as soon as possible. There are no specialized diagnostic tests to establish whether a person is affected by cluster headaches. To diagnose CHs, a doctor will assess the following criteria: Brain function. In order to rule out any neurological problems, such as brain or vessel abnormalities, which may be the cause of the headache(s), a brain scan will be performed. If any previously-unknown abnormalities are revealed, these will be considered to be the cause of the headaches, and a diagnosis of CHs will not be given at this time. Instead, the abnormalities will be investigated further and treated. In otherwise-healthy people affected by CHs, the brain scan will be normal with no abnormalities. Doctors can then be confident that the CH attacks are caused by CH disorder rather than any impairment of brain function. Doctors will also assess a person’s medical history with a focus on whether the person’s symptoms could relate to any other headache disorders, and find out whether a person has a family history of cluster headaches. Although the link between genetics and CHs is not understood, people with relatives affected by CHs are more likely to develop the condition. Finally, doctors will find out whether a person’s experience of their headache(s) matches the diagnostic criteria for a cluster headache, which include: Having at least one symptom which is ipsilateral (on the same side of the head as the pain) in the eye, nose or face Restlessness or agitation A duration of 15 minutes to three hours without effective response to medication or painkillers A frequency of between one attack every other day or eight attacks per day and an incredibly severe pain\n\nDoctors will be aware that a person may be affected by other primary headache disorders , which may result in them experiencing headaches that are similar to cluster headaches. These include: 3 12 13 Trigeminal neuralgia. A chronic pain disorder affecting the same nerve that is involved in cluster headaches. Migraine. Some headache attacks can feature autonomic features such as teary eyes. Migraines can also often occur in bouts, which leads to the widespread misconception that a person is experiencing cluster headaches, when they are in fact experiencing clusters of migraines. Hemicrania continua. A chronic, persistent headache that usually occurs on the same side of the face and head, usually consisting of a constant dull pain which intermittently becomes piercing. Short-lasting, unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT). Like CHs, SUNCT headaches are a subtype of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia headaches, but their duration is much shorter than cluster headaches.",
    "cluster_headaches_treatment": "People who have been diagnosed with CHs are usually treated by a type of doctors specialising in brain and nerve conditions called a neurologist. Those affected by CHs will require both short and long-term treatment in order to manage their headache disorder: Short-term treatment for CHs focuses on relieving headache attacks themselves by reducing their pain and duration Long-term treatment of CHs aims to reduce the frequency of headache attacks and to prolong the periods of remission between bouts. With effective treatment, a person affected by chronic CHs may be able to reduce the frequency of their headaches to the point at which their CH disorder becomes episodic.\n\nAfter having diagnosed CHs, doctors will discuss a range of treatments which a person can use during a headache attack in order to relieve their pain. The pain associated with a CH is so severe that it cannot be alleviated with traditional over-the-counter (OTC) painkillers. Specialized treatments for CHs can usually relieve headache pain in 15-30 minutes. These treatments are called abortive agents because they begin to relieve (abort) pain more quickly than OTC painkillers, which are designed to be swallowed. They can be administered by vaporisation, i.e. breathing them in through the nose, or by injection into a muscle, or vein. 14 The principal abortive agents used to relieve the symptoms of a CH attack are oxygen therapy and sumatriptan injections.\n\nThis treatment involves breathing in pure oxygen through a mask at the start of a CH attack. Masks and containers of pure oxygen will be provided by a person’s doctor, and they will be shown how to use the equipment so that they can carry out this treatment themselves, independently, whenever a CH strikes. The rate at which the oxygen is dispensed from the container can be adjusted, and people are usually recommended to breathe in oxygen at a rate of around 15 litres per minute at the start of the attack, which they can decrease to a rate of six to eight litres per minute when the symptoms subside. It is important to continue breathing in the oxygen for five to ten minutes after the attack has finished, otherwise it may return.\n\nSumatriptan is a medication which is used in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain, which stops the transmission of pain signals. Sumatriptan works best as an abortive agent when injected into the skin and can be injected into the outside of the thigh or upper arm. Never inject sumatriptan into a vein or muscle. 15 A person’s doctor will demonstrate how to inject sumatriptan, and these injections are then safe to use independently, ideally at the first sign of a CH attack. Sumatriptan is most effective when used at the start of a CH attack. Doctors will recommend the appropriate dose and dosing schedule in each case. 16 It is also possible to use sumatriptan as a nasal spray, but this method of administration is considered to be significantly less effective at reducing CH symptoms than sumatriptan injections. Always inform a doctor if a person is on a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) medication before taking sumatriptan. SSRIs increase the levels of serotonin in the brain, a property which sumatriptan shares. Using two serotonergic medications, agents which increase serotonin levels, simultaneously can lead to serotonin syndrome: an adverse reaction to having too much serotonin in the body.\n\nCH attacks can be physically exhausting. Although the pain of a cluster headache will alleviate after using an abortive agent, the affected person is likely to benefit from a period of recovery, which may involve resting, spending time in a calm, quiet room and drinking water to stay hydrated. If a person is likely to be affected by CH attacks at work, it is recommended that they inform their workplace, so that their employers understand the nature of the condition and can accommodate their needs. During a bout of CHs, these may include working from home or taking several breaks to manage attacks. 17\n\nFor people who experience cluster headaches so frequently that they cannot manage the condition effectively using oxygen therapy or sumatriptan injections, additional treatments may be recommended. These include: 18 19\n\nThis treatment involves providing the affected person with a small, handheld device which they can use to treat CH attacks when they occur. The device can also be used in between attacks to reduce their frequency. The TVNS device works by emitting a low-voltage electrical current, which, when applied to the skin on the neck near the vagus nerve, will stimulate it, relieving tension and pain. However, TVNS can, in rare cases, cause a CH attack to develop, and this treatment option may therefore be unsuitable for some people. 20\n\nThe sphenopalatine ganglion is a nerve bundle which is located behind the nose. In people affected by CHs, low-voltage electrical stimulation of of the SPG can relieve the pain of a CH attack. SPG stimulation requires the implantation of a device – which is smaller than an almond – into the side of the face. General anaesthetic is used to implant the device, and a small incision is made in the upper gum on the side most affected by CHs. The implantation procedure takes around an hour, and there is no visible scarring. After implantation, people affected by CHs can activate the device to stimulate the SPG by using a handheld monitor when they feel an attack coming on. The SPG can also be stimulated between attacks to reduce their frequency.",
    "how_to_prevent_cluster_headaches": "The causes of cluster headaches are unknown, so it is not possible to prevent the development of the CHs disorder itself. However, using tobacco products is a known cause of CHs, and giving up tobacco products may therefore reduce a person’s chances of developing CHs. People who are affected by CHs can take measures to prevent headache attacks, including avoiding triggers and making healthy lifestyle choices.\n\nKeeping a diary of the circumstances surrounding one’s CHs can help a person to identify any possible triggers of headache attacks within a bout of CHs. Logging one’s CHs can also potentially help to establish the overall triggers of CH bouts, such as seasonal changes. The affected person can then make lifestyle choices aimed at avoiding triggers, e.g. not wearing perfume in Spring and Fall, if their bouts of CHs generally occur during seasonal changes and strong smells are found to be a likely triggering factor.\n\nPreventative medications for CHs vary in effectiveness between people, and a person may need to try several different forms of medication to find the one that is right for them. A person may take preventative medication all year round in the case of chronic cluster headaches, or periodically to prevent headache attacks during a bout. 2 Doctors will help to decide on the preventative medication(s) that are most suitable for each person, according to their pattern of CH bouts and general health. The first-line medication for preventing CHs is a type of medication regularly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, called a calcium channel blocker. In this case, it works to reduce vasoconstriction, which helps prevent CH attacks. These kinds of medications may cause heart problems to develop in some people, so a person’s heart will be monitored regularly, using an ECG machine when they are using this medication, to safeguard against this. 21 Other medications which may be prescribed to as preventative treatments for CHs include: 21 22\n\nThese medications are usually used in bursts of 2-3 weeks, generally to help break a cycle of CHs or in conjunction with other therapies that take longer to take effect. Due to the side-effects associated with long-term use, such as high blood sugar and the thinning of bones, these medications are suitable for short-term use only.\n\nThis treatment involves injecting an anaesthetic and steroid medication into the nerves that supply the scalp, at the back of the head. It is carried out in hospital by a doctor and can bring about periods of remission in people with CH disorder lasting a month or more. The procedure takes around a minute to perform and can be repeated every two months.\n\nMost often prescribed to treat chronic cluster headaches, this oral medication can help to re-regulate hormonal imbalances within the brain, reducing the frequency of CH attacks. However, use of this medication must be accompanied by regular blood tests to measure the levels of lithium in the blood. Having elevated levels of lithium for prolonged periods can cause problems such as kidney damage. Problems such as this can be avoided with close medical supervision. 23\n\nThese kinds of medication have been found to be effective in inducing periods of remission in people affected by CHs and in reducing the frequency of attacks when taken long-term. It is taken orally, and the dosage is usually increased over time at the discretion of a person’s doctor. 24\n\nAlthough medical treatments are usually needed in order to bring cluster headache disorder under control, many people who are affected by CHs find that making certain changes to their lifestyle can help them manage the condition and reduce the frequency of headache attacks. These include: Relaxation: Practicing relaxation skills such as yoga and deep breathing can help to diffuse stress and aid muscle relaxation. Setting aside periods of the day for relaxation and taking regular breaks from activities that involve sitting or standing in the same position can help to diffuse the buildups of muscle and nerve tension that contribute to CHs. Resting well : Getting eight hours of sleep a night and going to bed at the same time each day can help to reduce stress, which can reduce the frequency of CHs. Exercising regularly: Exercise releases beta-endorphins in the body, which can relieve stress. Exercising for 20 minutes, three times per week, can help to decrease the frequency of CHs and the severity of individual attacks. Staying hydrated: Drinking eight glasses of water or other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages per day can help. For people who are affected by chronic or persistent CHs, opting for non-alcoholic beverages instead of drinks containing alcohol all year round can help to prevent CHs. Cutting down on, or cutting out, caffeine can also help prevent CHs. Seeking help to quit using tobacco products: The likelihood of being affected by CHs is greater among people who consume tobacco products than those who do not. In people with CHs, quitting is recommended. Doctors will be able to provide a range of resources on quitting smoking and connect a person to support programs suited to their needs.",
    "complications_associated_with_cluster_headaches": "Although  a person may worry that they are dying during a cluster headache due to the intensity of the pain, this condition is not life-threatening and does not pose any direct health risks. However, relative to the general population, people affected by CHs may be more prone to certain behaviors which carry severe health risks, including: Injuring themselves during CH attacks Alcohol abuse Other forms of substance abuse Suicide attempts, in particular in cases of severe and persistent CHs) Diagnosing and beginning treatment for CHs is the best means of minimising these risks and avoiding complications. For people who have been correctly diagnosed with this condition, and who are being treated effectively, the most likely negative impact of CHs is a reduced quality of life, due to having to spend time away from work, education or social events during headache attacks. The extent to which a person’s quality of life is reduced by CHs can, in many cases, be lessened by accessing effective treatment options.",
    "cluster_headaches_faqs": "Q: What are the key differences between a cluster headache and a migraine? A: Cluster headaches are unilateral (affecting one side of the head). This is one of the principal factors which distinguish CHs from migraines. Migraines involve a more generalized pain and typically affect both sides of the head at once. Additionally, the duration of a migraine is usually much longer than that of a CH, up to 72 hours. 25 People affected by a migraine tend to want to sit or lie down, whereas a person experiencing a CH is prone to agitated movement. Q: Are any home remedies or natural products effective at treating CHs? A: The two most popular natural remedies for cluster headaches are: Melatonin. Taking supplements of melatonin, a hormone found naturally in the body which helps regulate sleep cycles, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks. 26 Capsaicin. Using a nasal spray or cream containing capsaicin, a compound with anti-inflammatory properties, found in hot peppers, has been found to help reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks. 27 Good to know; Not much clinical research has been carried out to establish the efficacy of either treatment in comparison to conventional treatments for cluster headache relief, such as suboptical steroid injections. In the evidence-based guidelines on treatments for cluster headaches devised by the American Headache Society, melatonin supplements are rated at grade C, i.e. possibly, rather than probably or certainly, helpful as a treatment for CHs, and intranasally applied capsaicin is rated at grade U, meaning that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation. 28 If a person wishes to incorporate natural remedies such as these into their treatment plan for CHs, they should consult a doctor before choosing natural products or beginning to use them. These treatments may not be suitable for everyone. Furthermore, some natural products may contain ingredients which do not combine safely with other treatments or medications."

    "condition": "Celiac Disease",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/coeliac-disease/",
    "what_is_celiac_disease": "Celiac disease is a serious, lifelong condition caused by the immune system reacting to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley and several other grains. It causes inflammation and damage in the small intestine and can result in a wide range of symptoms throughout the body. 1 2 Symptoms of celiac disease in adults and children may include: 1 3 Abdominal (belly) pain or discomfort Diarrhea Fatty, pale, smelly stools that float in the toilet Rash Fatigue Irritability and depression However, many people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms, which can make a timely diagnosis challenging. Celiac disease often goes unrecognized; only a small fraction of people with the condition are diagnosed. 5 2 Celiac disease can affect anyone, of any age, though it tends to be more common among women than men. It occurs in approximately one out of every 100 people. There seem to be two peak periods in the appearance of symptoms – one in the first year of life, between eight and 12 months of age, and the second between approximately 20-40 years of age. Celiac disease is linked to certain genes and is often found to run in families. 1 3 6 In people with celiac disease, eating food that contains gluten causes a severe response from the immune system; it mistakenly damages the lining of the small intestine, leading to difficulty absorbing nutrients and a number of potential complications. 1 2 There is currently no cure or way to prevent celiac disease. The only treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet. Following a strict gluten-free diet allows the lining of the small intestine to heal, clearing up symptoms and reducing the likelihood of developing complications. Any ingestion of gluten will result in damage to the intestine and a relapse of symptoms. 1 3 2",
    "celiac_disease_symptoms": "The symptoms of celiac disease can vary widely and range from mild to severe. If present, they are typically persistent. Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in adults may include: 5 1 3 7 Transient abdominal (belly) pain Bloating Flatulence or excess wind Fatty, pale, smelly stools that float in the toilet Diarrhea or, rarely, constipation Poor appetite Nausea and vomiting Other signs and symptoms of celiac disease in adults may include: 5 1 8 7 Fatigue and lethargy Anemia Severe or persistent mouth ulcers , or canker sores Dermatitis herpetiformis, a type of rash Unintentional weight loss Lack of menstruation Infertility Repeated miscarriage Osteoporosis Unexplained bone or joint pain Dental enamel problems Ataxia, loss of coordination Peripheral neuropathy; tingling, numbness or pain in the hands and feet Headaches Irritability Depression or anxiety Dementia, in older people Many adults with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms. People experiencing symptoms that they suspect may be linked to celiac disease can carry out an assessment using the free Ada app .",
    "causes": "Celiac disease is caused by a severe response to gluten, a type of protein found in wheat, barley, rye and several other grains. In some people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, eating foods containing gluten can trigger the body’s immune system to mistakenly damage the lining of the gut. 1 It is not understood exactly why this happens. 9 Reacting to gluten, the immune system causes inflammation and irritation in the lining of the small intestine. The villi, which are tiny, tube-like projections in the lining and play a key role in the absorption of digested food, become flattened. This is called villous atrophy and can lead to malabsorption, with serious nutritional deficiencies and health complications as a result. 5 1 3 2\n\nCeliac disease can affect anyone, of any age and racial background. However, certain factors may make a person more likely to develop celiac disease. These include: 1 8 Having a close relative, e.g. a parent or sibling, with celiac disease; this significantly increases one’s risk Having another autoimmune condition, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis , type 1 diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis Turner syndrome, a disorder in which a female only has one out of two X chromosomes Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21\n\nThe terms “leaky gut” and “leaky gut syndrome” are often encountered by people looking for information on celiac disease and/or gluten sensitivity. Leaky gut and leaky gut syndrome are not recognized medical terms. They refer to something known as intestinal permeability, which means the ease with which substances are able to move through the mucosal barrier, or wall, of the small intestine. 10 11 12 13 In a healthy intestine, the gaps between cells in the mucosal barrier are usually very small, only allowing appropriately digested nutrients and other substances through to the bloodstream. However, certain substances and conditions can cause the gaps to widen or the intestinal barrier to become “loose” or “leaky”. Celiac disease is one such condition. It is thought that gluten may cause increased intestinal permeability in a number of people without celiac disease, too. 10 11 12 13 There is a theory that increased intestinal permeability might allow potentially harmful substances, e.g. undigested proteins, bacteria and toxins, to pass from the gut into the bloodstream and cause widespread inflammation in the body, with a range of resulting health problems. 10 11 12 13 There is not enough evidence to confirm many of the ideas about leaky gut and the possible effects it may have in the body. Doctors generally recommend eating a balanced, healthy diet for optimal digestive and overall health. 10 11 12 If you have any questions about your digestive health, it is recommended that you consult a medical doctor.",
    "diagnosis": "After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically order blood tests if celiac disease is suspected. If the results suggest that celiac disease is present, a biopsy will then be recommended to confirm the diagnosis. 1 Good to know: If you think that you might have celiac disease, it is very important that you do not go gluten-free until you have spoken to a doctor and been tested, if necessary. Adopting a gluten-free diet can interfere with the blood test and biopsy results and may cause a false negative. 1 9\n\nA blood test is used to check for the antibodies, proteins that typically fight infection and which are typical of celiac disease. These include IgA tissue transglutaminase (IgA tTG), endomysial IgA and IgG deamidated gliadin peptide. The levels of these antibodies are usually only high in people with celiac disease. 9 A doctor may also recommend blood tests to check for nutritional deficiencies, e.g. iron deficiency. 1\n\nIf the blood test shows high levels of the antibodies found in celiac disease, a diagnosis will typically need to be confirmed with a biopsy of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. This involves a doctor taking a small sample of tissue, typically using an endoscope – a thin tube that is passed down the throat into the stomach and intestine. The sample is examined for signs of the characteristic damage caused by celiac disease. 1 9\n\nIn some cases, it may be possible to have a test to check for the presence of the genes that are associated with celiac disease. Not having HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 genes means that developing celiac disease is highly unlikely. However, having the genes does not mean that a person will develop celiac disease; the majority of people with a genetic predisposition to celiac disease never develop the condition. 14 15",
    "celiac_disease_treatment": "There is currently no cure for celiac disease – treatment requires adopting a completely gluten-free diet. In addition, certain supplements and vaccinations may be recommended to help prevent complications from celiac disease. 5 1\n\nThe only effective treatment for celiac disease is a diet that is 100 percent free of gluten. Following a strict gluten-free diet typically results in a rapid improvement in symptoms; a person will usually start to feel better within a couple of weeks, and the lining of the small intestine will start to heal. 5 1 3 2 A strict gluten-free diet must be followed for life; the consumption of even a very small amount of gluten can cause damage to the small intestine and trigger a relapse of symptoms. 1 Gluten is found in the following grains: 5 1 3 Wheat Rye Barley Spelt Einkorn Kamut Triticale Any foods that contain the above, e.g. breads, pastries and many cereals, will therefore also contain gluten, and must be avoided. Sauces, snack foods, ready-made meals, beers and even medicines are among the many products that often contain gluten; labels should always be checked carefully. Gluten is not found in the following unprocessed starches: Rice Potatoes Corn\n\nThere are differing opinions on whether oats are suitable for people with celiac disease. Oats contain a protein called avenin, which is similar to gluten. For some people with celiac disease, this does not seem to be a problem. However, others find that it causes a relapse of symptoms and/or damage to the small intestine. Furthermore, some brands of oats may be contaminated with gluten from the factories they are processed in. Some celiac disease authorities advise that oats be included in a person’s diet, while others recommend avoiding all oats and oat products. A doctor may be able to advise on what is most appropriate for a particular person’s dietary needs. 16 8 17 18 Good to know: It is possible to enjoy a balanced, healthy diet that does not contain any gluten. Fruit, vegetables, dairy, soya, eggs, fish and meat are all gluten-free, and gluten-free breads, snacks and other products are increasingly available. A doctor will be able to offer advice and/or refer a person to a dietician, support groups and information resources.\n\nA doctor may recommend the following measures to help prevent nutritional deficiencies and other complications from celiac disease: 1 19 Taking a vitamin, calcium or iron supplement, for at least six months after diagnosis Having the seasonal “flu jab”, the yearly influenza vaccination Having other vaccinations, e.g. the Hib vaccine to prevent blood poisoning and pneumonia , and the pneumococcal vaccine 20",
    "complications": "Maintaining a strictly gluten-free diet is essential to prevent symptoms and lower the likelihood of complications from celiac disease. Eating even a tiny amount of gluten can cause symptoms and increase the risk of developing complications. 1 Complications associated with poorly managed celiac disease include: 5 1 9 Vitamin D deficiency , iron deficiency and other nutrient deficiencies Osteoporosis Skin problems, e.g. dermatitis herpetiformis Ulcers in the intestine, known as ulcerative jejunitis Weakened functioning of the spleen and possibly the immune system as a result 20 Other autoimmune conditions, e.g. type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis Anxiety and depression Rarely, lymphoma, a cancer of the intestinal lymph system, and other cancers of the gastrointestinal tract 21 Infertility In undiagnosed women having a child, low birth weight, premature birth or miscarriage In children, stunted growth, delayed puberty and dental problems\n\nAbout one in 10 people with celiac disease will continue to experience symptoms after they have switched to a strict gluten-free diet. This is often caused by hidden sources of gluten in the diet, but may also be the result of: 5 9 Food intolerances, e.g. lactose, a sugar found in cow’s milk Food allergies Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine Irritable bowel syndrome Microscopic colitis A deficiency of pancreatic enzymes Refractory celiac disease\n\nA small number of people with celiac disease may continue to experience gastrointestinal symptoms even on a confirmed gluten-free diet, or experience short-term relief when going gluten-free and then a recurrence of symptoms. This is called refractory celiac disease. The cause is unknown, and the condition requires treatment with immunosuppressive medication, e.g. steroids. 9",
    "prevention": "Previously, it was thought, by not introducing gluten into a baby’s diet until they were 4-6 months old, it might be possible to prevent or slow the development of celiac disease. However, recent research shows that the period at which gluten is first introduced does not affect the development of the condition. It is not yet possible to prevent celiac disease in children or adults. 22 23 Nonetheless, early diagnosis and treatment can help to prevent further development of, and complications from, celiac disease. It is recommended that anyone who experiences symptoms, or could be considered to be at risk for the condition, ask a doctor about screening. For people who are diagnosed with celiac disease, following a strict gluten-free diet can help to prevent further damage to the digestive tract and other complications. 23",
    "celiac_disease_in_children": "Celiac disease can affect people of any age, including infants and children. If present, symptoms of celiac disease in children are typically persistent. Gastrointestinal (digestive tract) symptoms in children may include: 24 25 Diarrhea or constipation Fatty, pale and smelly 1 stools that float in the toilet Bloating or abdominal (belly) pain Flatulence, commonly known as gas Weak appetite Nausea and vomiting 1 Other signs and symptoms in children may include: 24 25 Fatigue Anemia Unexplained weight loss or difficulty gaining weight Delayed growth and/or puberty Severe or persistent mouth ulcers , or canker sores Dermatitis herpetiformis, a type of rash Dental problems, e.g. discolored teeth or grooves in the teeth Thinning of the bones Anxiety and/or irritability 26 Sleep disturbances Many children with celiac disease do not have any symptoms, or only have mild symptoms. If a child is suspected of having celiac disease, a doctor will typically recommend blood tests before making any dietary changes and, if the result is positive, a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for celiac disease in babies and children is the same for adults and requires a strictly gluten-free diet. While this may be challenging for the family, it is necessary at all times, without exception and must be continued for the rest of the person’s life to avoid complications. Support groups are available to assist families in adjusting to and managing a 100 percent gluten-free lifestyle.",
    "other_names_for_celiac_disease": "Coeliac disease (UK spelling) Celiac sprue Non-tropical sprue Gluten-sensitive enteropathy Gluten intolerance (however, celiac disease is more serious than the mild sensitivity to gluten experienced by many people)",
    "celiac_disease_faqs": "Q: Is celiac disease genetic? A: Yes. Celiac disease is said to be genetic, because it typically develops in people who carry genes called HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These genes are found in about 30 percent of people. However, not everyone who has these genes will develop celiac disease; only about one in every 30 people will develop the condition. It is triggered by a combination of genes and environmental factors. If a close relative has celiac disease, a person’s likelihood of developing it is higher, and screening may be recommended. 5 2 26 Q: Is there a test for celiac disease? A: Yes. There is a blood test that can detect the antibodies – proteins that typically fight infection – found in celiac disease. If the test is positive for these antibodies, diagnosis is typically confirmed with a biopsy, where a small sample of tissue is taken from the small intestine and checked in a laboratory. 1 Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and gluten sensitivity? A: Some people who do not have celiac disease may nonetheless experience similar symptoms when eating foods containing gluten, and they may feel better when they exclude gluten from their diet. This is called non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or simply gluten sensitivity. 14 Q: What is the difference between celiac disease and a wheat allergy? A: Celiac disease is a severe response to gluten, a type of protein which is found in wheat and many other grains. Eating foods containing gluten causes a long-term autoimmune reaction, where the body is attacked by its own immune system. Symptoms may not appear immediately. A wheat allergy, on the other hand, is an immediate, short-term reaction to proteins found in wheat specifically. Eating foods containing wheat or being exposed to wheat in other ways causes the immune system to try and attack these proteins as if they were invading germs. The immune system does not attack the body. The symptoms of celiac disease and wheat allergy are different. 27 28 Q: Is there a celiac disease vaccine? A: Not yet. A vaccine for celiac disease is currently being researched and tested in clinical trials to see whether it works and whether it is safe for people to receive. It is called Nexvax2® and aims to desensitize people with celiac disease to gluten, so that it no longer triggers an autoimmune response. 30"

    "what_is_colorectal_cancer": "Colorectal cancer, also known as bowel cancer, is a cancer that begins in the large intestine, the endpoint of the body’s digestive system, which food waste travels through, before exiting the body. Most of the large intestine is called the colon. The final part that food travels through before exiting the body as stool is called the rectum. Seven out of ten cancers of the large intestine begin in the colon, while the remainder start in the rectum. 1 Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the U.S. 2 Symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on how large the cancer has grown and how far it has spread. There are likely to be no symptoms in the early stages of colorectal cancer, which is why attending regular screening is important. When symptoms begin, they may include blood and mucus being visible in feces, as well as an uncomfortable feeling in the bowel. 3 Colorectal cancer is more likely to affect people when they are over 50. It is also more likely to affect a person whose family has a history of colorectal cancer. Certain inherited conditions, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), are strong risk factors, but these are very rare. 4 5 Avoidable risk factors include obesity, smoking tobacco products and low levels of exercise. ref3 The cancer is diagnosed through certain tests that allow a doctor to look inside a person’s large intestine. This can be achieved by inserting a camera into a person’s body, such as in a colonoscopy or by using X-rays. 6 Surgery is normally the only way to cure colorectal cancer. 7 However, depending on how developed the cancer is, surgery may no longer be an option for some people. In those cases, medication can be used to manage symptoms and attempt to prolong a person’s life. The best way to prevent the more dangerous forms of colorectal cancer is to attend regular screening for the condition.",
    "symptoms": "Colorectal cancer is unlikely to cause any symptoms initially. Early stage colorectal cancer is usually detected through regular screening , rather than through any suspicion that the person has the condition. 8 Signs of colorectal cancer include: 8 9 10 Blood or mucus in the feces Changes in bowel habits, such as having diarrhea or being constipated A feeling of needing a bowel movement that does not go away after having one Pain from gas, bloating, cramps or a feeling of being full Bleeding from the anus Iron-deficiency anemia Unexplained and/or unintended weight loss Tiredness or feeling weaker than normal Where in the large intestine the cancer is found has some effect on the likely symptoms. Tumors in the right side or early part of the colon are more likely to cause the following symptoms: 8 11 Bleeding Diarrhea Iron-deficiency anemia Tumors in the left side or latter part of the colon are more likely to cause the feeling of bowel obstruction. They are also likely to be detected later on than ones in the right side. 8 Many of the symptoms are similar to other bowel conditions, such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure . Begin your personal health assessment on the Ada app .",
    "causes": "The majority of colorectal cancer develops out of small clumps of tissue, known as polyps, that form out of the lining of the large intestine. Colon polyps are very common, affecting between 20 and 30 percent of adults in the U.S. at some point in their lives, and most will never become cancerous. 12 Non-cancerous polyps are also called benign polyps. Benign polyps mutate into cancerous or malignant polyps due to a change in their gene chemistry. 13 This is usually due to the activation of a gene in a cell that makes it more likely to develop cancer. However, it may also be caused by genes that help prevent the development of cancer somehow becoming suppressed. Once cells in the large intestine become cancerous, they can break away and spread to other parts of the body in a process known as metastasis. The cancer is usually spread through the lymphatic system 14 or the bloodstream.",
    "risk_factors": "Genetically inherited conditions, preexisting health conditions and a person’s lifestyle can all be factors contributing to the development of cancer of the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer is more likely to affect a person when they are over 50, but some younger people, especially those with certain health conditions, are at an increased risk. 4 5\n\nA diagnosis of colorectal cancer is more likely if a family member has been affected by the condition in the past or has developed benign polyps in the colon before they are 60 years old. 15 Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare hereditary condition that prompts the development of hundreds or even thousands of polyps in the large intestine. If left untreated, people affected by this condition are almost certain to develop colorectal cancer by the age of 40. A milder version of FAP exists, called autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis, in which dozens, rather than hundreds, of polyps form. A person with a family history of this condition or a family history of colorectal cancer more generally should be tested by a doctor. 13 16 People affected by FAP should ideally start being screened for polyps when they are between 10 and 12 years of age. 17 Lynch syndrome or HNPCC carries a 40 percent lifetime risk for developing colorectal cancer. Lynch syndrome affects the ability of DNA to self-repair; this can lead to cells mutating and becoming cancerous. 13 15 Other genetically inherited conditions that lead to the formation of polyps in the bowel, such as hamartomatous polyposis syndrome, are a rare risk factor. 15 A person diagnosed with any of the above conditions will be a candidate for regular colorectal cancer screenings at a younger age. 17\n\nColorectal cancer is more likely to affect people who: 13 15 Are obese, particularly men Do not exercise regularly Consume high quantities of alcohol Smoke tobacco products A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes is also a risk factor for colorectal cancer.\n\nThe conversation about the contribution of dietary factors to colorectal cancer is continually evolving. However, there is strong evidence that the following increase the possibility of being affected by the condition: 13 15 High intake of red and processed meat, as well as animal fats Low intake of fiber, particularly whole grain and cereal fiber Low intake of folate , found in broccoli, brussels sprouts, leafy greens Low intake of calcium, found in dairy products, leafy greens and nuts Low intake of fruit and vegetables generally Eating more fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt and sour cream, offers some protection against colorectal cancer, research suggests. 13\n\nPeople with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), i.e. Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis , are at increased risk of being affected by colorectal cancer. There seems to be a link between inflammation of the gut and the mutation of cancerous cells. As a result, the longer the person is affected by IBD, the greater the risk. After a diagnosis of an IBD, a doctor will likely recommend a person for early colorectal cancer screening.",
    "diagnosis": "The earlier cancer is detected, the easier it is to be treated. Regular screening considerably lowers the risk of colorectal cancer reaching a more harmful stage. if symptoms are present, then a person is likely to be physically examined and asked questions about what they have been experiencing before doctors run tests.\n\nA colonoscopy is the most accurate test for colorectal cancer. In a colonoscopy, medical professionals use a thin and bendy tube, called an endoscope or colonoscope. This tube has a camera attached to the end that is used to examine the inside of the large intestine. 19 Before a colonoscopy, the entire colon and rectum needs to be cleaned out, usually by using laxative medications to provoke temporary diarrhea. The person’s diet may need to be restricted in the runup to the procedure. Sedation, a calming drug, is generally required during the procedure to avoid pain. 20 Polyps or other growths that are found can be removed using a wire loop attached to the endoscope. These growths can then be examined under a microscope in a process known as a biopsy. Read more about Preparing for a Colonoscopy »\n\nA sigmoidoscopy is a less invasive version of a colonoscopy. This procedure also involves using a tube with a camera attached to the end to inspect the inside of the bowel. However, a sigmoidoscopy can only be used to assess the rectum and the lower part of the colon, known as the descending or sigmoid colon. A colonoscopy can look for evidence of cancer in the entirety of the large intestine. Before a sigmoidoscopy, a person will need to evacuate their bowels. This generally involves avoiding solid foods beforehand, followed by an enema, which is when fluid is inserted through the rectum to provoke laxative effects. 21\n\nA CT colonography is a CT scan of the large intestine. This is less invasive than a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and also allows a doctor to assess the entirety of the bowels. A CT colonography may be recommended if a person is unable to undergo a colonoscopy. Similarly to before a colonoscopy, laxatives will be required to clear out the bowels, and a restricted diet will need to be followed in the run-up to the procedure. 22 If cancer is suspected after a colonography, then it is likely that the person being tested will have to undergo a traditional colonoscopy as well. 22 This is because a biopsy will generally be required to make a firm diagnosis, and polyps cannot be removed during a CT colonography.\n\nTest kits exist that can be used at home to detect whether there is any blood present in a person’s feces. If this is the case then a person is likely to have some sort of bowel issue, which may be colorectal cancer. Completing a stool test involves collecting a small sample of feces in a container and sending it to a lab for testing. There are two types that are commonly used for colorectal screening: 23 24 A fecal occult blood test (FOBT), also known as a guaiac test A fecal immunochemical test (FIT) An immunochemical test is easier to use and is better at detecting abnormalities, but it is generally more expensive than a guaiac test. If either test gives an abnormal result, i.e. a significant amount of human blood in the feces, then a colonoscopy will be required. A positive result of blood in the feces does not necessarily mean a person has colorectal cancer. There are several other conditions that can cause this symptom, including hemorrhoids and anal fissures . Stool tests are useful for letting doctors know if a person should have a colonoscopy. However, they are not enough to rule out the presence of colorectal cancer alone and should not replace regular colonoscopy screenings.",
    "colorectal_cancer_screening": "Colorectal cancer screening is very effective, and all the diagnostic tests described above reduce the risk of developing the disease considerably. There is some debate about what age people should begin being screened and how regularly screening should happen.\n\nIn the U.S., the current guidelines are that regular screening for colorectal cancer should begin at the age of 50. 25 26 27 For those at increased risk of colorectal cancer, e.g. people with a family history of the condition, doctors may recommend that regular screening begins at an earlier age, usually around 45. However, this depends on the condition. For example, people affected by FAP are recommended to begin being tested between the ages of 10 and 12. The American Cancer Society even argues that regular screening should begin for everyone, not just high risk groups, once they reach 45 and even earlier for people with high risk for colon cancer. 27 In England, the National Health Service (NHS) recommends regular screening from the age of 55 onwards. 28 However, NHS England is set to lower that age to 50 in the coming years, bringing it into line with the NHS in fellow U.K. countries Scotland and Wales. The conversation around these guidelines is continually evolving. It is generally recommended to see a physician for regular health check-ups. In cases of any doubt about symptoms or test results, a proper diagnostic work-up is recommended, even if someone is younger.\n\nThe regularity of testing depends on the test chosen. For example, some people choose to try and avoid more invasive tests, such as a colonoscopy. However, this usually means that they will require testing more regularly. A doctor will be able to advise on the differing testing methods. In the U.S., the guidelines are as follows: 25 Colonoscopy testing every 10 years Flexible sigmoidoscopy testing every 5 years Double-contrast barium enema testing every 5 years 29 Computed tomographic (CT) colonography testing every 5 years A person will only have to undergo one of these types of test at the time intervals listed above, e.g. a sigmoidoscopy at ages 50, 55, 60 and so on. However, a colonoscopy will generally be required if any of the other tests listed above comes back with an abnormal result. Stool-based FOBT and FIT tests should take place yearly if that route is chosen. FIT tests for DNA do not necessarily have to take place every year, but the gap between tests should be a maximum of three years. Guidelines differ by country. The NHS in England offers a one-off flexible sigmoidoscopy, known in the U.K. as bowel scope screening, for people aged 55. 30 A stool test is then sent to people aged over 60 to complete every two years. If either of the two above tests produces abnormal results, then a colonoscopy is likely to be recommended.",
    "colorectal_cancer_staging": "Once colorectal cancer is diagnosed, doctors will try to find out whether it has spread and, if so, how far, in a process known as staging. The staging system most often used for colorectal cancer is the TNM system, developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). In the TNM system: 31 T refers to tumor size N refers to the number and location of lymph nodes 14 with cancer M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized or spread The tumor may also be given a grade, which describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under the microscope and may be factored into the staging. The cancer may then be given a number stage from 0 to 4, often followed by subdivisions of a, b or c. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. An overview of the stages for colorectal cancer is as follows: 31 32 33\n\nThis describes when the cancer is at the earliest stage possible and only exists in the mucosa 34 of the bowel. Stage 0 colorectal cancer is also described as carcinoma in situ.\n\nThe cancer has spread into the submucosa, a layer of tissue that connects the mucosa to the muscular layer of the bowel. Cancer may have also reached the muscular layer at this stage. However, it has not spread to other parts of the body or to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe cancer has grown and moved to the outer layer of the bowel and potentially: Through the muscle wall To nearby tissue outside the bowel and potentially nearby organs The cancer has not spread to distant parts of the body or to the lymph nodes.\n\nThe cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the fat that surrounds the lymph nodes, but not to distant parts of the body.\n\nThe cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the liver or lung.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of colorectal cancer depends on what stage the condition has reached and where in the large intestine the cancer begins. Colorectal cancer, particularly in its early stages, may be curable. However, a cure may not be possible in some cases. At that point, treatment will be guided towards either slowing down the growth of the cancer or to easing the symptoms that the cancer is causing. 35\n\nTreatment for stage 1, 2 and 3 rectal and colon cancers, i.e. before the cancer has spread to other organs or distant sites in the body, will generally all involve surgery. Surgery is the only way to cure colorectal cancer.\n\nDuring colon cancer surgery, any cancerous growths in or around the colon will be removed. The surgical removal of part or the entirety of the colon is known as a colectomy. There are two ways the procedure can be done: 36 35 An open colectomy involves making a large incision in the abdomen and removing the cancerous section of the colon A laparoscopic colectomy is a less invasive form of surgery. Small incisions are made in the abdomen and a camera guided inside. The surgeon uses the live video feed and surgical tools to bring the colon out through the incision so it can be operated upon outside the body. Usually, only a part of the colon will be removed. However, for people with colon cancer linked to genetically inherited conditions such as FAP and HNPCC then a total colectomy, in which the entire large intestine is removed, may be required. In either case, a colostomy may be a temporary or permanent requirement.\n\nRectal cancer surgery also requires the removal of cancerous growths. If the cancer is caught very early, then this may be possible to achieve during a colonoscopy. However, in most cases a larger part of the rectum as well as surrounding tissue will need to be removed. 36 If the cancer is in the upper part of the rectum, it may be possible to remove just a part of the rectum and then reconnect the colon to the lower part. However, if the cancer is in the lower section then the entire rectum and anus may need to be removed through a type of surgery called an abdominoperineal resection. The latter option will require a permanent colostomy. 37\n\nAfter rectal or colon cancer surgery, a doctor may need to perform a colostomy. A colostomy is an operation which allows the body’s waste to be diverted out of the large intestine through a hole in the abdomen. Over this hole is a pouch, known as a colostomy bag, in which the waste can be collected. A colostomy may be required: If the doctor wants the remaining parts of the bowel to heal before being joined back together. In this case, the colostomy may be temporary. If enough of the bowel has been removed that it can no longer control bowel movements, such as when the rectum and anus are removed. In this case, the colostomy is likely to be permanent. Colostomies cause a considerable amount of change to a person’s life and will take some time to get used to. However, after a period of adaptation, most people can live relatively normal lives.\n\nThe standard treatment for stage 4 colorectal cancer is chemotherapy aimed at managing symptoms rather than curing the disease. However, there are a number of cases where surgery may still be an option if the spread is limited to certain organs, such as the liver or the lung. A doctor will be able to advise on whether this is a possibility. 38\n\nChemotherapy is the use of drugs and medication to treat cancer. Radiotherapy is the use of beams of radiation to kill cancer cells. Neither of these treatments can entirely remove colorectal cancer on their own. When they are used alongside surgery in an attempt to rid the body of cancer, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are called adjuvant. If the cancer has spread to the point where surgery is no longer an option, then chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be used to manage symptoms and prolong a person’s life.\n\nChemotherapy is usually administered for three to six months after surgical treatment for cancer in the colon or rectum. The aim of this will be to kill any remaining cancer cells in the body. Post-surgery radiotherapy is usually only used when the cancer is located in the rectum and is generally given alongside chemotherapy. 37 39 When the cancer is located in the rectum, then it may be recommended to use a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in advance of surgery. This is known as neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In some cases, a short course of just radiotherapy may be given ahead of surgery. Neoadjuvant treatment will almost always need more chemotherapy and sometimes more radiotherapy, after surgery has taken place.",
    "prognosis": "In many cases, colorectal cancer can be cured. However, this generally depends upon the stage of the cancer’s development. The survival rate for those diagnosed with stage 0 or stage 1 colorectal cancer is very high. Screening for colorectal cancer has significantly contributed to a drop in both the number of people being diagnosed with the condition and the number of deaths. 40 Despite these improvements, over a third of U.S. adults aged between 50 and 75 have never been screened for colorectal cancer. 41 Once colorectal cancer has spread to other parts of the body, it is much harder to treat, which is why regular screening for the condition is so important.\n\nThe National Cancer Institute has produced five-year relative survival rates for different stages of colorectal cancer. This refers to the percentage chance a person diagnosed with that stage of colorectal cancer has of surviving compared to the general population. This is a more useful statistic than the plain survival rate, as some people with colorectal cancer are likely to have died after five years for unrelated reasons. The relative survival rate factors in this possibility and, as a result, gives a more accurate forecast of the disease’s dangers. The relative five-year survival rates for cancer located in the colon are as follows: 42 92 percent at stage 1 Between 65 percent and 87 percent at stage 2 Between 53 percent and 72 percent at stage 3 12 percent at stage 4 The relative five-year survival rates for cancer located in the rectum are as follows: 42 88 percent at stage 1 Between 50 percent and 81 percent at stage 2 Between 58 percent and 83 percent at stage 3-13 percent at stage 4 The large amount of variation at different stages is because of the complexity of the staging system. For example, the cancer may have grown very aggressively in the colon, but not spread to other parts of the body. It is unclear why the relative survival rate was better at stage 3 than stage 2 for rectal cancer.",

Most colds are caused by a group of viruses known as rhinoviruses, of which there are over a 100 different types. 3 After having a cold, the affected person becomes immune to that particular virus strain. However, due to the large amount of cold-causing viruses, many people still experience an average of two to three colds per year. As children tend to spend a large amount of time in close contact with other children and are less aware of the methods of preventing a cold, they are prone to experiencing an average of 8-12 colds per year. Colds are normally spread through hand-to-hand contact and less commonly through coughing, sneezing or touching a surface that has been exposed to the virus.",

The information leaflet that accompanies the product should always be read before use and their guidelines should be followed. 5 Painkillers: Ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen may be effective for the relief of a fever and as general pain relief. Children may be given painkillers, though age-appropriate versions (usually available from pharmacies) are generally advised. Children should never be given paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time. Some people prefer  to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) medications such as aspirin to help relieve the symptoms of a cold. Under no circumstances should a child 12 years or younger be given these medications. Decongestants: Oral or spray decongestants may be effective in relieving a runny or blocked nose and help ease breathing problems. They should not be taken by children under 6, and only on the advise of a doctor in children under 12. The effects of decongestants only last for a short period and should not be used for over a week. Cold medicines: All-in-one cold medicines generally include a combination of painkillers and decongestants, making them effective at relieving a variety of cold symptoms. Generally, these medicines should not be taken in combination with any other medication. Lozenges: Oral lozenges help to lubricate the lining of the throat, making them effective at relieving a sore throat.

They are most often found on the hands or fingers , but can also occur in any other non-genital location. Common warts are caused by an infection with certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) – an umbrella term for a large group of viruses causing different conditions. 1\n\nHPV is contagious , meaning common warts can be passed from person to person, whether through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly through contact with a surface or object that is carrying the virus. People with weakened immune systems and children are more at risk of developing common warts. The condition is generally considered to be non-serious and will often clear naturally without treatment. However, if necessary, treatment options, including minor removal procedures and home remedies, are available. 2",

HPV infects the skin through small cuts, scrapes, or weak spots, with warts appearing approximately two to six months later. The virus causes the protein keratin to develop in excess on the surface of the skin, resulting in the appearance of a wart. 5 6 Common warts are particularly prevalent in children and young adults , as well as people with weakened immune systems as a result of conditions such as HIV/AIDS , certain other severe and long-lasting medical conditions, receiving certain kinds of chemotherapy, or after procedures such as organ transplantation and the ensuing treatment. 5 HPV is contagious and is passed on through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirect contact with objects or surfaces. Damaged or wet skin is most likely to pick up the virus, meaning locations such as swimming pools and showers, especially public ones, are particularly common sources of infection. 7",
    "diagnosing_common_warts": "In the majority of cases, a doctor or dermatologist will be able to diagnose common warts through a simple physical examination . If further confirmation is needed, a skin biopsy may be ordered. To do this, the top layer of a wart will be scraped off and sent to a laboratory for testing. This is a straightforward and minimally invasive procedure. 8",
    "common_warts_treatment": "Common warts will often disappear without treatment, especially in childhood . However, common warts can also be persistent and last for a significant amount of time. They can sometimes be painful and unsightly, especially when they form in clusters. In these cases, treatment options are available. 8\n\nPrescription wart treatments may be used in conjunction with home remedies or when home treatment options seem unlikely to clear the condition. The method chosen by the doctor or dermatologist will depend on the severity of the warts, the symptoms, and the general health of the person. 2\n\nSalicylic acid: This is a popular method for treating warts. Salicylic acid works by gradually dissolving layers of the wart tissue, eventually resulting in total removal. It is generally applied to the wart as a gel or liquid. Though salicylic acid is also available in over-the-counter products, prescription varieties are typically stronger and more effective. Along with peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also encourage the body’s immune system to combat the virus. Cryotherapy: Generally performed by a doctor or dermatologist, cryotherapy is a method of freezing warts using liquid nitrogen. After around a week, the resulting dead tissue can be sloughed off. Repeated cryotherapy sessions may be necessary.\n\nIf the above options are ineffective, other, less common treatment methods may be used. These include: 8 Trichloroacetic acid: This is a strong acid applied by a doctor or dermatologist to the warts. 9 Immunotherapy: The affected person is given antigens, substances which encourage the body’s immune system to fight the wart itself. This treatment is generally reserved for those with recurring common warts. 10 Electrosurgery: This method involves burning away the wart tissue using a specially designed heated needle. A local anesthetic will usually be required to numb the pain, and scarring is possible. Laser treatment: A laser is used to burn off the skin tissue and remove the wart. It is generally considered to be a last resort option due to the likelihood of scarring and the extended recovery time. 11\n\nGiven that common warts are generally non-serious, some people may choose to try and treat them at home, possibly after visiting a pharmacy , or before seeking professional medical advice. Common techniques for doing this include: 2 Salicylic acid products: Non-prescription salicylic acid products, such as plasters, gels, and rubs, are available from most pharmacies. These salicylic acid products work in the same way as the prescription version, though may be less powerful. Repeated application will generally be necessary. Liquid nitrogen: Non-prescription liquid nitrogen products are generally available from pharmacies for application at home, usually in the form of a liquid or gel. Apple cider vinegar: A possible remedy is to mix two parts apple cider vinegar with one part water, apply this to the wart using a cotton ball, and leave the wart to soak in the solution for at least 20 minutes. Repeat this process until the warts have disappeared. Discontinue or consult a medical professional if you experience severe skin irritation or severe pain, and in case of any doubt, always consult a doctor first. 11 12 It can take a significant amount of time before home remedies make a difference, and they may not result in wart removal or cause side effects. If treatments prove ineffective or side effects are strong or worrying, seeking professional medical advice is recommended.",
    "common_warts_prevention": "It can be difficult to fully avoid contracting common warts, and most people experience them at some point in their life. However, certain preventative measures can help reduce the risk. These include: Avoiding contact with other people’s warts Avoiding contact with clothing, objects, or surfaces that may be carrying the virus, e.g. by wearing water shoes or flip-flops in a public pool or public showers If a person already has warts, they should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to other areas of the body or other people. They can: Avoid unnecessarily touching or scratching the warts Cover warts with a plaster, especially when swimming Wash your hands regularly, especially after contact with the warts Avoid sharing towels and clothing that may come in contact with warts",
    "other_names_associated_with_common_warts": "Verruca vulgaris Palmar warts, sometimes misspelled as palmer warts",
    "common_warts_faqs": "Q: Are common warts contagious by touch? A: The virus that causes common warts, human papillomavirus (HPV), is contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of contracting HPV, which can be spread through skin-to-skin contact or through contact with an object or surface carrying the virus. The risk of contracting HPV is especially high in warm, wet conditions, such as those found at a swimming pool or in a locker room. 4 Q: Are common warts HPV? A: Common warts are caused by infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), which is an umbrella term for over 100 types of viruses. Certain strains of HPV can cause common warts to develop on the hands, fingers and other non-genital areas of the body. Other strains of HPV can cause different wart types to appear on different parts of the body, including sexually transmittable genital warts , or different conditions altogether, including, in rare cases, cervical cancer or anal cancer . Q: Are common warts the same as genital warts ? A: No, common warts are not the same as genital warts. Though both types of warts are caused by the HPV group of viruses, the strains that cause each type are different and so are the methods of transmission. Unlike common warts, genital warts are spread through sexual contact, they are an STI/STD. Common warts cannot spread to the pubic area and genital warts cannot spread to the hands or other parts of the body. 1 13 Read more about genital warts. Q: Can you get a common wart on your arm? A: Yes. Though common warts often develop on the hands or fingers, they can also appear anywhere else on the body other than the genital area. Q: What is the difference between common warts and plantar warts? A: Both common warts and plantar warts are a product of the human papillomavirus (HPV) group of viruses. Unlike plantar warts, however, common warts can develop anywhere on the body, though most typically grow on the hands and fingers. Plantar warts are found on the feet only. Q: What is the difference between common warts and water warts? A: Common warts are caused by infection with HPV. Water warts, also known as molluscum contagiosum, are caused by infection with the molluscum contagiosum virus. The infection causes small, painless raised bumps or lesions on the skin, which often appear in groups and typically clear up on their own. 14 Q: What kind of wart do I have? A: If you are concerned about a wart or another skin condition, you can use the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. To receive a confirmed diagnosis, however, it is necessary to see a licensed doctor. Q: Do common warts bleed? A: A common wart should not bleed unless it is scraped, scratched, or injured in some way. If a wart bleeds without a clear cause or bleeds profusely after injury, it is important to consult a doctor without delay. 6 Q: Can common warts be painful? A: While most warts do not cause pain, some can, especially if they grow in an area that is pressed on often, e.g. a fingertip. If a common wart is painful, it is recommended that you see a doctor to make sure it is not serious and to receive appropriate treatment. 15 Q: Can a common wart get infected? A: A wart itself is the result of infection of the skin with HPV. Warts do not generally become infected with bacteria unless they are scratched, cut, or otherwise injured in some way. In such cases, it is possible that bacteria may enter the wart or surrounding area, and a bacterial infection may result, causing pain, discoloration, and other symptoms. If you are concerned that a wart may be infected, it is advisable to consult a doctor. 16 Q: Should I be concerned about common warts during pregnancy ? A: No, infection with HPV should not pose any risk to your baby. As in any case of common warts, no treatment may be necessary, though options are available over the counter and from doctors. 17 Q: Does duct tape work on common warts? A: Occasionally recommended as a home remedy for warts, duct tape has not been confirmed as an effective treatment. Research is conflicting, but some people believe that doing the following may help to get rid of a common wart: Covering the wart with a small piece of duct tape Removing the duct tape every three to six days and gently using an emery board or pumice stone on the wart Covering the wart with a fresh piece of duct tape about 10 to 12 hours later Results may only be seen after a number of weeks, if at all. Duct tape can cause skin irritation, bleeding, and pain when removed. It should never be used in sensitive areas, such as the underarms or face. 18 Q: What are the signs that a common wart is going away? A: When it is clearing up, or “dying”, a wart may shrink and start to disappear. This may happen on its own or with treatment. 19 Q: What should I do if a common wart won’t go away? A: If a wart does not go away after treatment with prescription and/or home remedies, it is recommended that you see a doctor to rule out other conditions and ensure that the most appropriate treatment is being used."

    "condition": "Congenital Hypothyroidism",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/congenital-hypothyroidism/",
    "what_is_congenital_hypothyroidism": "Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition that can affect newborn babies. The word congenital means present at or before birth, while hypothyroidism refers to insufficient levels of thyroid hormone. While congenital hypothyroidism is a serious condition, it can generally be detected and treated early enough to prevent complications, thanks to routine screenings after birth in many parts of the world. 1 The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower part of the neck, just below the voice box. Hormones released by the thyroid control the body’s growth and metabolism . They affect key physical processes like heart rate, digestion, weight and temperature. Adequate levels of thyroid hormone are essential for the healthy physical and mental development of a baby. Congenital hypothyroidism affects approximately one in every 2000 to 4000 newborns 5 and has been found to be more common in female babies. 1 The condition occurs when the baby’s thyroid gland does not develop or function properly. In the majority of cases, the gland itself is absent, smaller than normal or located in the wrong place. However, congenital hypothyroidism may also result when the gland is normal, but there are problems with the production of thyroid hormone. 6 In the USA, UK and many other parts of the world, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism within a few days of birth. A simple heel-prick blood test is typically used, and if the results suggest the presence of congenital hypothyroidism, further tests will be done to confirm the diagnosis. Where necessary, treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone will be started without delay. 1 6 7 If left untreated, congenital hypothyroidism can lead to severe, irreversible mental impairment and poor growth. However, with prompt, proper treatment and monitoring, the prognosis is excellent, and infants with congenital hypothyroidism will usually grow up to lead normal, healthy lives. 1 6",
    "congenital_hypothyroidism_symptoms": "Most newborn babies with congenital hypothyroidism show no obvious signs of the condition. 5 This may be because they receive some of their mother’s thyroid hormone before being delivered. They may also be able to produce a small amount of their own. 1 However, some babies affected by congenital hypothyroidism may be less active, sleep a lot and be difficult to feed. 6 9 If congenital hypothyroidism is severe, the following signs and symptoms may also be present: 1 5 ref9 Weak cry Poor feeding Constipation Dry skin Poor muscle tone (floppiness) Cold hands and feet - they may also be mottled Prolonged jaundice , which is when the skin has a yellow color Puffy face Large tongue Swollen stomach Umbilical hernia Large fontanels, which are the soft spots on a baby’s head. It is important that a newborn baby be screened for congenital hypothyroidism as early as possible in order to prevent complications. In many countries, babies are screened sufficiently soon after birth that they will generally not have symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism. However, in rare cases, a baby with the condition may have symptoms immediately after birth. 5 In parts of the world where screening is not performed, a baby may not show symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism initially, but they will typically develop symptoms in the first few months after birth. 5 If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can do a free assessment using the Ada app .",
    "congenital_hypothyroidism_causes": "The most common cause of congenital hypothyroidism is the baby’s thyroid gland not developing properly. The gland may be absent, smaller than normal or positioned in the wrong part of the neck. It is not known why this happens, but the malformation is not usually inherited – meaning that any siblings are unlikely to be born with the same thyroid condition. Other less-common causes of congenital hypothyroidism include: 1 Problems metabolizing thyroid hormone; this may be inherited Problems with the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, two very important, connected parts of the brain that regulate a large number of bodily processes Iodine deficiency in the parent during pregnancy , though this is uncommon in developed countries High levels of thyroid antibodies 10 in the parent during pregnancy Antithyroid medication taken during pregnancy, in a small number of cases Excessive iodine intake, congenital liver hemangiomas (non-cancerous growths of blood vessels) and certain gene mutations may also be factors in the development of congenital hypothyroidism. 11",
    "diagnosis": "In many countries, all newborn babies are screened for congenital hypothyroidism shortly after birth. This is done in hospital using a pinprick test that draws a small amount of blood, usually from the baby’s heel, to check their thyroid hormone levels. The baby will typically be checked for other conditions such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease at the same time. 1 If the baby’s thyroid hormone levels are not within the acceptable range, a doctor will order further blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. They may also request a thyroid ultrasound scan to be performed in order to assess the physical status of the thyroid gland. Treatment will be started immediately. 1",
    "congenital_hypothyroidism_treatment": "Treatment for congenital hypothyroidism typically involves medication, monitoring and assessment of the baby’s development.\n\nThe standard treatment for congenital hypothyroidism is the prescription of synthetic thyroid hormone in the form of levothyroxine (L-T4). In many cases, it will be necessary to take levothyroxine for life, even into older adulthood. 9 Levothyroxine comes in tablets, which should be crushed and given to the baby in a small amount of water or milk every day. A doctor will advise on the dose needed, as well as what foods to avoid giving the baby before and after taking the medication. It is important not to mix the tablets with soy formula or any preparation containing concentrated iron or calcium. When the child is older, they can swallow the tablets on their own with a cup of water. The dose will need to be adjusted as the child grows up. 5 9 Prompt, proper treatment with levothyroxine can generally prevent complications from congenital hypothyroidism. The medication is generally considered safe and has no side-effects at the correct dose. If the dose is too low, symptoms of hypothyroidism may develop, while too high a dose can lead to symptoms of hyperthyroidism .\n\nIn many cases, a doctor will recommend working with a pediatric endocrinologist, a specialist in childhood conditions related to hormones, to help manage the baby’s congenital hypothyroidism as they grow up. 9 The baby will need to have regular medical check-ups to make sure that their thyroid hormone levels are adequate for healthy growth and development. Regular blood tests will also be required. Until the baby is one year old, tests will usually be necessary every one to three months or more frequently. Thereafter, it may be possible to reduce the frequency of blood tests. A doctor will adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed. 9\n\nA doctor will also monitor the height, weight and overall growth and development of the child. They will periodically assess the child’s language and communication skills, motor ability and behavior. 1 If it seems necessary, a doctor may recommend having the child’s development formally evaluated. Should there be any delays in speech or learning, an early intervention program can often be arranged to assist the child. ref3",
    "prevention": "It is generally not possible to prevent congenital hypothyroidism. 9 However, pregnant people with a history of thyroid conditions, as well as those taking any medications or supplements, are advised to consult with medical practitioners before, during and after pregnancy in the interests of optimal health management. Read about Thyroiditis »",
    "congenital_hypothyroidism_faqs": "Q: Will a baby with congenital hypothyroidism grow up normally? A: If a baby with congenital hypothyroidism is diagnosed and treated promptly and correctly, the outlook is excellent. The child has a good chance of leading a normal, healthy life. If diagnosis and treatment is delayed, however, serious developmental problems may occur. 1 9 In babies with severe congenital hypothyroidism, it is possible that there may be long-term neurocognitive, i.e. mental, effects. If treatment is not started promptly or the dosage or administering of levothyroxine is incorrect, the child may experience developmental delays. 9 Q: Is congenital hypothyroidism curable? A: Children who have an underactive thyroid from birth can be treated with synthetic thyroid hormone . In many cases, this medication will need to be taken for life. Some infants may experience transient hypothyroidism, which is when the condition goes away over time. However, it should never be assumed that a baby’s thyroid problem will clear up on its own. It is important to follow the treatment plan recommended by the doctor to avoid serious complications. 12 13 Q: Is levothyroxine safe for babies? A: Yes. Levothyroxine is a synthetic version of the thyroid hormone produced by healthy thyroid glands. It is very effective and is considered safe to take every day for babies, children and adults with hypothyroidism. However, it is important to check the baby’s thyroid levels regularly and adjust the dose of levothyroxine as needed. This is because too much levothyroxine can cause [ symptoms of hyperthyroidism ](symptoms of hyperthyroidism, while too little can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism . 9 If you are concerned about any symptoms, you can do a free assessment using the Ada app . Q: Does congenital hypothyroidism run in families? A: In a small number of cases, congenital hypothyroidism is caused by an inherited condition . In these instances, the thyroid gland itself typically appears to be healthy, but there is a problem with the production of thyroid hormone. If a doctor suspects a hereditary condition, they may refer the baby and parents to a specialist in genetics to confirm the diagnosis and advise on future family planning. Q: Is congenital hypothyroidism an autoimmune disease? A: There are a number of possible causes of congenital hypothyroidism . One less common cause is the presence of thyroid antibodies 10 in the mother during pregnancy, which may be associated with an autoimmune thyroid condition . However, this does not mean that congenital hypothyroidism is an autoimmune condition. Q: Is congenital hypothyroidism rare? A: Congenital hypothyroidism occurs in an estimated one in every 2000 to 4000 newborn babies. 5",

    "condition": "Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/conjunctivitis/",
    "what_is_conjunctivitis_pink_eye": "Conjunctivitis is the medical name for inflammation of the conjunctiva; this is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids and which also covers the white part of the eye. Commonly known as pink eye, conjunctivitis is often caused by a virus (see viral conjunctivitis ), bacteria (see bacterial conjunctivitis ), allergies (see allergic conjunctivitis ), or other non-infectious causes. Conjunctivitis is a common eye condition and is not usually serious. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nGeneral symptoms of conjunctivitis include: 1 2 3 4 5 Pinkness or redness of the eye, hence the name “pink eye” Burning, itching, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye Discharge from the eye; this may be watery or thick and pus-like, depending on the cause Formation of a crust around the eye from discharge Swollen and/or reddened eyelids\n\nDepending on the type of conjunctivitis, other signs and symptoms may be present. One or both eyes may be affected by conjunctivitis. When only one eye is affected, it is called unilateral conjunctivitis. When both eyes are affected, it is called bilateral conjunctivitis. Many cases of mild conjunctivitis clear up on their own, without specific treatment. Home remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) treatments may be useful. Cleaning the eyes with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, applying warm or cool compresses, and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antibiotics, antiviral medication or allergy medication may be necessary in more serious cases of conjunctivitis. 1 2 3 4 5 Most people make a full recovery from conjunctivitis, and the condition does not typically cause any complications. However, in a small number of cases, pink eye can be very serious and may cause damage to the eyes if it is not treated effectively. Conjunctivitis can affect people of any age, though bacterial conjunctivitis tends to be more common among children than adults. 3 Bacterial and viral conjunctivitis are highly contagious, which means that the infection can spread easily from one person to another. It is important that a person with infectious conjunctivitis take steps to avoid passing it on to others, such as practising good hygiene.\n\nAnyone with severe conjunctivitis symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include: 3 5 Intense pain in the eye Extreme redness in the eye Inability to open the eye Severe sensitivity to light Blurred vision that persists after wiping away discharge If symptoms are mild but do not go away, medical advice should also be sought. Furthermore, if conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be very severe, and medical advice should be sought without delay.",
    "how_to_diagnose_pink_eye": "If symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of conjunctivitis can generally be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be managed at home with home remedies and OTC eye drops. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms seem severe, seeing a doctor is very important. A doctor will take the person’s medical history and examine their eyes to determine whether pink eye is present, and if so, what type of conjunctivitis it is. They will rule out other eye conditions like dry eye syndrome and more serious concerns such as uveitis and keratitis, which is an inflammation of the cornea, the front part of the eye. In some cases, laboratory tests may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. 2 4",
    "types": "There are three main types of conjunctivitis or pink eye:\n\nBacterial conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by infection with bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia, or, less commonly, the bacteria chlamydia (causing chlamydial conjunctivitis) and gonorrhea (causing gonococcal conjunctivitis), which are sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Read more about bacterial conjunctivitis, including specific symptoms, treatment approaches including antibiotics, possible complications and prevention strategies.\n\nViral conjunctivitis is pink eye that is caused by infection with a virus, e.g. adenovirus – the group of viruses that cause the common cold , herpes simplex or herpes zoster ophthalmicus . Read more about viral conjunctivitis, including specific symptoms, treatment options including antiviral medication, possible complications and prevention strategies.\n\nThe third type of conjunctivitis is not caused by bacteria or viruses and is not infectious, meaning it cannot be spread from person to person. There are several different subtypes of non-infectious conjunctivitis. These include:\n\nAllergic conjunctivitis is the most common subtype of non-infectious conjunctivitis/pink eye and is caused by an allergen, e.g. pollen, dust or animal dander. Read more about allergic conjunctivitis , including specific symptoms, types including giant papillary conjunctivitis and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, treatment options and possible complications.\n\nSometimes mistaken for an allergic reaction, this type of conjunctivitis can be caused by irritation from a variety of substances. These include cosmetic products, soaps, swimming pool chlorine and other commonly used chemicals, smoke, dirt and other objects that may get into the eyes. 2 9 10 11 If the eye suffers physical trauma, for example by being hit or scraped, symptoms of conjunctivitis may also develop. 11 This can be very serious, and a doctor should be seen without delay to prevent complications. Mild cases of irritant-related conjunctivitis can usually be treated by removing or avoiding the irritating substance, flushing the eyes with water and applying compresses and lubricating eye drops to the eyes. However, more serious cases may require specialist medical treatment. If symptoms are severe, or the irritant is a toxic substance, e.g. a strong chemical, medical attention should be sought urgently.\n\nThis type of conjunctivitis is also often mistaken for an allergic reaction and can be considered a subtype of irritant conjunctivitis. However, toxic conjunctivitis is caused by the use of certain eye care products or eye medications for a long period of time. It most commonly occurs in people with glaucoma . Toxic conjunctivitis tends to be commonly caused by preservatives in eye medication, contact lens solutions, and artificial tears. 12 A doctor can advise on the best treatment approach.",
    "conjunctivitis_in_newborn_babies": "Newborn babies can be affected by various types of pink eye, including viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis, as well as irritant-caused conjunctivitis. Regardless of the cause, pink eye in infants is called neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum. Babies with conjunctivitis usually develop puffy, red eyelids and discharge from the eyes within 1-14 days of birth. 3 13 During the childbirth process, an infant’s eyes may become infected with a virus or bacteria from the mother. In some cases, this may be the bacteria linked to chlamydia and gonorrhea , or, rarely, the herpes simplex viruses that cause oral herpes and genital herpes . 13 14 Silver nitrate solution, traditionally administered to a newborn’s eyes to prevent conjunctivitis, can actually cause irritant conjunctivitis. For this reason, many doctors now avoid using silver nitrate and use antibiotic eye drops instead. However, some babies may develop irritant conjunctivitis from the chemicals in these eye drops, too. 13 15 16 Sometimes, a case of conjunctivitis in a baby is confused with sticky eyes caused by a blocked tear duct. However, a blocked tear duct will not cause the redness or swelling seen in conjunctivitis. 3 Conjunctivitis in babies can be extremely serious, and any infant showing signs of conjunctivitis should be taken to a doctor immediately. Treatment with antibiotic, antiviral or other medication may be necessary, together with referral to an ophthalmologist. 14",
    "conjunctivitis_treatment": "In many cases, conjunctivitis in adults and children will clear up on its own, without specific treatment. To relieve discomfort, the following home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may be helpful: 2 3 17 18 Gently wiping discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad, or cotton wool soaked in water Applying lubricating eye drops, called artificial tears, which are available without a prescription, to the eye Applying a cold or warm compress – a clean cloth that has been soaked in water – to the eye Avoiding rubbing the eyes, as this may aggravate symptoms Avoiding the use of contact lenses and makeup until the conjunctivitis has cleared In the case of allergic conjunctivitis, avoiding exposure to the allergen, e.g., dust In serious cases of conjunctivitis, prescription eye drops and other medicines, such as antihistamine tablets for allergic conjunctivitis, antibiotics for bacterial conjunctivitis, and antiviral medication for viral conjunctivitis, may be recommended. Sometimes, a person will be referred to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for treatment. 19",
    "associated_terms_used_for_conjunctivitis": "Pink eye, or pinkeye Eye infection or inflammation Madras eye",
    "conjunctivitis_pink_eye_faqs": "Q: Are conjunctivitis and pink eye the same thing? A: Yes. Conjunctivitis is the medical term for the common eye condition known colloquially as pink eye or pinkeye. Q: Is conjunctivitis contagious? A: Whether conjunctivitis is contagious or not depends on the cause. Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria or conjunctivitis caused by a virus is highly contagious and can be spread easily from person to person. However, pink eye caused by allergies or irritants is not contagious and cannot be transmitted to other people. Q: Is conjunctivitis airborne? A: In some cases, it can be. For example, in the case of allergic conjunctivitis, the condition can be caused by airborne allergens such as pollen. In the case of viral conjunctivitis, it is possible that infection may occur by coming into contact with airborne droplets released when an affected person coughs or sneezes. In many cases of infectious conjunctivitis, however, it is spread by hand-to-eye contact or direct contact with a contaminated object, for example when other family members share towels or washcloths with an infected person. 20 Q: Can conjunctivitis go away by itself? A: Yes. In many cases, pink eye is mild and will clear up on its own without any specific treatment. However, in some cases, the condition can be severe and may require treatment with prescription medications. If you have any concerns about an eye condition, it is advisable to consult a doctor. Q: Can pink eye cause a sore throat? A: Pink eye itself cannot cause a sore throat. However, pink eye and sore throat may be two symptoms caused by infection with a cold virus, which is a common cause of conjunctivitis. There may also be a runny nose and other signs of a common cold . 21 While uncommon, a person can also experience strep throat and pink eye at the same time. The bacteria that cause strep throat can also cause conjunctivitis. 22 Q: I have had conjunctivitis for several weeks. Do I need to see a doctor? A: How long pink eye lasts often depends on the cause: most mild, uncomplicated cases of viral conjunctivitis and bacterial conjunctivitis clear up within 1-2 weeks. If symptoms do not improve after a few days or they get worse, or there is any confusion about what is causing eye symptoms, it is advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. If antibiotic medicine has been prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis and symptoms do not begin to improve after 24 hours, a doctor should also be seen. 2 23 If you are concerned about any non-severe symptoms, you can use the Ada app for a free assessment."

    "what_is_contact_dermatitis": "Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin triggered by a substance the skin has come into contact with. The substance may be an allergen, something that provokes an allergic reaction, or an irritant, something that damages the skin. 1 Inflammation commonly results in red, itchy and cracked skin. 2 Contact dermatitis is a common condition that is more likely to affect people who work with their hands, such as healthcare workers, food-industry workers, cleaning staff, hairdressers and some factory workers, especially when the work exposes the skin to possible irritants. It is generally a non-serious condition that will clear up with treatment. People with symptoms that may be linked to contact dermatitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "contact_dermatitis_vs_atopic_dermatitis": "Contact and atopic dermatitis are related conditions with similar symptoms and treatment options. However, while contact dermatitis has a direct cause, an allergen or an irritant, the causes of atopic dermatitis are less clearly identifiable. Why some people develop the condition, is not fully understood, but studies suggest that some people may be genetically predisposed to developing it. Read more about Atopic Dermatitis »",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of contact dermatitis occur on the part of the skin that has come into contact with the cause of the irritation. These include: The hands The face Areas of skin that have been in contact with certain metals, for example in jewellery Areas of the skin that have been in contact with clothing Typical symptoms of contact dermatitis include: Swelling Itchy skin A red, blotchy rash Dry and scaly skin Fluid-filled blisters People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to contact dermatitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "There are two types of contact dermatitis: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Of these, irritant contact dermatitis is the more common, accounting for roughly 80 percent of all cases. 1 Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a substance that irritates the skin. Irritants come in many forms, and may include: 3 Prolonged exposure to water can cause skin irritation, especially if the water contains chlorine or is hard or chalky Detergents, such as washing-up liquid, laundry soap or bleach Solvents, such as petrol or chemicals found in the workplace Acids and alkalis Dust, soil and powders Certain plants, such as clematis, hellebore and poison ivy The condition may develop following a single exposure to a very strong irritant or develop from frequent exposure to a weaker irritant. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with a specific substance which triggers an allergic reaction, known as an allergen. The allergen can be something the skin has newly been exposed to or something it has been exposed to many times before. Why some people develop allergic contact dermatitis and some do not is not entirely clear. 1 3 A wide array of substances can cause an allergic reaction, though some of the most common include: 3 Nickel, a substance common in metal alloys used in everyday items, such as jewellery, clothes and bra straps Cobalt, a metal sometimes found in jewellery Chromate, a metal sometimes found in cement mixtures Cosmetics, such as perfumes, hair dyes and nail varnish",
    "diagnosing_contact_dermatitis": "Irritant contact dermatitis is diagnosed by trained medical professionals, according to the person’s history of exposure to irritants and through an examination of the area of skin that is affected. In addition to an examination of the affected area, a patch test will be carried out to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis. This involves applying small patches containing common allergens to the skin, typically on the back, leaving them for a set amount of time, normally around two days, and then inspecting the skin beneath them for signs of dermatitis. The results will allow the dermatologist to identify which allergen is responsible for the reaction. 4",
    "contact_dermatitis_treatment": "Treating contact dermatitis will typically involve moisturizers, topical corticosteroids and/or steroid tablets. A dermatologist will be able to advise on the best course of treatment for each person. 5 Moisturizers are often useful in the treatment of dry and scaly skin. A variety of different emollients are available, and a dermatologist will be able to offer advice on which type is most suitable. 5 Topical corticosteroids are steroid-containing creams and ointments that are applied directly to the affected skin. They can be effective in treating the redness and pain of dermatitis. Topical corticosteroids are available in a range of strengths. The strength of the preparation the affected person is prescribed depends on the  severity and location of the dermatitis. 5 In severe cases, particularly when the dermatitis covers a large area of skin, steroid tablets may be prescribed. 5 Always follow the instructions provided by the doctor when taking this kind of medication. In mild cases, home remedies such as cool baths or cool, wet compresses may be effective in soothing the symptoms of contact dermatitis.",
    "contact_dermatitis_prevention": "Avoiding contact with the irritant or allergen that is causing contact dermatitis is the most effective way of preventing the condition. If total avoidance is not possible, creating a barrier between the substance and the skin, for example by wearing gloves or closed shoes, is recommended. Carrying out a patch test before using new cosmetics or detergents, and using barrier creams may also help to prevent the onset of contact dermatitis.",
    "contact_dermatitis_complications": "In most cases, contact dermatitis does not cause complications. If the condition is not treated effectively, however, complications are possible.\n\nContact dermatitis can lead to a bacterial skin infection. This is made more likely if the skin is broken, for example by an injury, or if the affected person persistently scratches their skin. An infection can cause the symptoms of dermatitis to worsen rapidly. If the following occurs, a doctor should be consulted: 6 The skin becomes redder, hotter and more painful The rash begin to ooze and/or crust over You feel generally unwell and/or have a fever A skin infection can typically be treated effectively using antibiotics. A skin infection from Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria can also lead to a condition called impetigo. Impetigo will usually also require antibiotics to treat. Read more about Impetigo »\n\nIf symptoms are particularly severe or long-lasting, this can affect a person’s quality of life. The condition may impact upon a person’s ability to do their job, for example, or cause them to become unhappy or depressed . A person who feels that contact dermatitis is affecting their quality of life should discuss the issue with their doctor.",
    "other_names_for_contact_dermatitis": "Contact eczema",
    "contact_dermatitis_faqs": "Q: Can contact dermatitis affect the eyelids? A: Yes, contact dermatitis may affect the eyelids. The upper or lower section of either eyelid may develop symptoms, which can include itching, burning, redness and scaliness. Contact dermatitis of the eyelids can be allergic in nature or caused by an irritant, such as soaps and detergents, dust particles and chemicals. 7 Q: Can contact dermatitis affect babies and children? A: Yes, contact dermatitis can affect people of any age. Irritants are the most common cause of the condition in babies and children. Potential irritants include: 8 Soaps Saliva and urine Detergents Baby lotions Perfume Metals, such as nickel, chrome and mercury In infants, contact dermatitis caused by urine is often called diaper rash or nappy rash . Symptoms are similar to those experienced in adults, and treatment will depend upon the child’s age and the severity of the condition. A doctor will be able to outline specific treatment methods but, in some cases, identifying and avoiding the cause of the reaction will be the first step in remedying the symptoms. If the cause is urine, barrier creams and regularly changed diapers are effective in managing the condition. Parents or carers who suspect their child may be displaying symptoms related to contact dermatitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment. Q: Can contact dermatitis affect the vulva? A: Yes, contact dermatitis can affect the vulva. The vulva is particularly vulnerable to the condition due to the sensitivity of the skin in that area. Common irritants and allergens include: 9 10 Soaps, detergents, shampoos and conditioners Deodorized tampons and pads Feminine hygiene products Nylon underwear Vaginal secretions, sweat and urine Spermicides and lubricants Medicines, such as benzocaine, neomycin and chlorhexidine Latex Symptoms typically include itching, burning, redness and skin thickening. In severe cases, the affected person may also experience pain during intercourse or when a tampon or speculum is inserted. 10 People displaying symptoms of contact dermatitis of the vulva should see a doctor for evaluation. Treatment will typically involve avoidance of the irritant or allergen and the use of a topical corticosteroid ointment. 10 Q: Is contact dermatitis contagious? A: No, contact dermatitis is not contagious. It is caused by contact with either an allergen or an irritant; it cannot be caught from another person. Q: Are there any home remedies for contact dermatitis? A: People affected by contact dermatitis should consult a doctor for evaluation and treatment. Not doing so could risk the condition becoming more severe. However, in some mild cases, a doctor may recommend home remedies such as cool baths or cool, wet compresses, which may be effective in soothing the symptoms in the short-term. 5"

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/contusion-bruise/",
    "what_are_contusions": "Contusion is the medical term for a bruise.A bruise forms when small blood vessels under the skin burst. This is usually due to an injury to soft tissues. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, muscle soreness and bluish discoloration of the skin that will usually start to decrease after a couple of days. Diagnosis is usually based on a physical examination of the bruised part of the body. Imaging tests may be needed to rule out other causes. Treatment may include resting the affected body part, applying cold packs, compression bandages and taking painkillers. Bruises can be avoided through proper protection against injuries. Depending on its severity, a contusion can take anywhere from a few days to weeks to fully heal. If you think you might have a contusion, try using the free Ada App to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "contusion_causes": "Contusions are caused by blunt trauma to the body. 1 It might be a direct blow or repetitive blows causing tissue damage and bleeding in the injured area. Bruises are among the most common sports injuries. ref2 2 3 But bruising may also result from car accidents, falling, landing on or running into an object or hard surface. 4 Sometimes contusions are caused by seemingly minor traumas. A bruised knee or toe may be a result of a simple bump into a chair or a table. So the location of the injury often depends on the circumstances. For instance, contact sports are a common cause of quadriceps contusion or a bruised thigh. 5 Bruised shoulder is a common injury in athletes playing sports such as football or hockey. Skiing, snowboarding or skateboarding can often lead to bruised thighs, hips, knees or elbows. A coccyx contusion or a bruise to the tailbone can be the result of an injury to the tailbone area or damage during childbirth. Prolonged pressure on the tailbone, such as from sitting, is another cause. Bruises can also be a sign of physical abuse. 1",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of contusions may include: Pain Swelling Tenderness Blue or purple discoloration of the skin Stiffness of the bruised area. 1 2 4 It is often difficult to freely move the injured part of the body. It might mean difficulty walking, bending or straightening the limbs. The muscles might feel weak too and sometimes a collection of blood might form a palpable lump. Bruises change color over time from pink through bluish, greenish-yellow until it comes back to the normal color of the skin. Do these symptoms sound familiar? Try Ada to find out more.",
    "diagnosing_bruises": "To assist with the diagnosis of a contusion a doctor will have to take the person’s medical history and conduct a physical examination. It is important to establish what exact trauma has led to the symptoms. History of easy bruising or bleeding might be a significant reason to explore other possible causes. Imaging tests such as X-ray, ultrasound, CT or MRI may be necessary to assess the extent of the injury in detail. They can also help to rule out other conditions. 1",
    "treatment": "There are established measures to take as soon as possible to relieve the symptoms of contusions. They are also crucial for the proper healing of the bruised part of the body.\n\nInitial treatment should always follow the RICE protocol: R for rest . Try to avoid strenuous activity involving the bruised part of the body. This means cutting back on physical exercises or sports. I for ice . Apply ice packs on the bruised area using a cloth or a towel to wrap the ice. Don’t place the ice directly on the skin. You could even use a bag of frozen vegetables. Apply the ice for up to 15 minutes several times a day. C for compression . It means continuous pressure of the bruised area. Wearing an elastic bandage around the injured part of the body may help reduce swelling. E for elevation . Try to raise the bruised area above the level of the heart. It, too, can help with the swelling. Cushion or pillows may come in handy when elevating your limbs. Follow these principles in the first 24 to 48 hours after the injury. This period is called the acute phase. During this time don’t put any heat on the contusion. Massaging the bruise should also be avoided.\n\nIn case of mild injuries, pain can be tolerable. However, taking painkillers may sometimes be needed. The following can be recommended to relieve contusion-related pain: Acetaminophen Anti-inflammatory painkillers. They are also called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and a number of them can be purchased over the counter (e.g. ibuprofen). 1\n\nSevere injuries require proper management after the acute phase. The recovery from a contusion may involve physical and occupational therapy. Education and instructions from specialists can help to adjust the routines after the injury. Returning to regular physical activity may take several weeks. Sometimes special equipment (e.g. padding) is used to prevent reinjuries.",
    "preventing_contusions_and_bruises": "Contusions can be avoided by reducing the risk of injuries: Use protective sports equipment (pads, guards, helmets) Wear proper shoes Prepare for the exercise. Always warm up and stretch before a physical activity Exercise caution around the house (e.g. while housekeeping, climbing ladders, etc.) Wear seatbelts. 2 4 5",
    "prognosis": "The outlook depends on the severity of the injury. Proper management is an important factor as well. Generally, a contusion can take a few days or weeks to fully heal. The most severe contusions can prevent athletes from taking part in sport for months. Most people fully recover with no further consequences. However, possible complications of contusions include: compartment syndrome myositis ossificans rhabdomyolysis."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/conversion-disorder/",
    "what_is_conversion_disorder": "Conversion disorder is a condition in which people experience symptoms affecting the nervous system that have no physical explanation. This may include symptoms such as: 1 Weakness Movement problems, such as tremors or twitching Sensory issues, such as loss of sense of smell or touch Blackouts\n\nConversion episodes are nearly always triggered by an overwhelmingly stressful event, an emotional issue, or a mental health disorder, such as depression. Although there may be no medical or physical cause found to explain the symptoms, they are real to the person who is experiencing them. Conversion disorder is relatively common, with women more likely to experience the condition than men. It can affect people of any age but tends to be more common between the ages of 20 and 50. Symptoms of conversion disorder may be worrying to experience but they do not pose any long-term threat to health. Although symptoms will generally get better without treatment, they may recur if the underlying cause is not addressed. Treatment of the underlying cause makes recurrence less likely.",
    "conversion_disorder_symptoms": "People with conversion disorder may experience symptoms such as: 2 3 Blindness Double vision Weakness or paralysis Muscular spasms Seizures Loss of balance Trouble coordinating movements (ataxia) Numb skin or tingling limbs Loss of sensation in limbs Memory loss Unresponsiveness Deafness Difficulty swallowing Inability to speak (aphonia) Loss of sense of smell (anosmia) Motor tics Hallucinations False pregnancy Symptoms may begin without warning and can be debilitating. Episodes are typically short in duration, usually lasting days or weeks, though this can vary from person to person. Up to 25 percent of people with conversion disorder may experience a recurrence of symptoms or develop new symptoms in the future. People experiencing possible symptoms of conversion disorder should consult a doctor.",
    "causes": "Conversion disorder is believed to be an expression of psychologically stressful experiences. While many people experience physical changes related to their mindset, such as a racing heart when feeling nervous, people with conversion disorder tend to experience more dramatic symptoms when faced with psychological and emotional stress. Examples of such emotions causing physical symptoms in people experiencing conversion disorder include: A person suppressing anger and the desire to hit someone may experience numbness, tingling, or paralysis of the arm A person with a past history of traumatic experiences may experience seizures and loss of consciousness, due to suppressing memories of their experience(s) Conversion disorder is classified in the DSM-5 as a somatic symptom disorder, the symptoms of which were formerly known collectively as somatoform disorders. Somatization is a process in which psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms. Although there may be no medical or physical cause found to explain them, the symptoms are real, and affected people are encouraged to seek medical attention.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by a doctor or psychiatrist based on the history of the affected person’s symptoms, as well as a discussion about their life and feelings. It can be difficult to diagnose conversion disorder, and multiple tests are often performed to exclude other causes of the symptoms. A diagnosis is usually reached by the process of elimination. Tests are likely to concentrate on possible other causes for the neurological symptoms. One sign that a person has conversion disorder may be that symptoms differ from those of neurologic conditions. Key indicators that a person may be affected by conversion disorder, rather than a neurologic condition include: 2 The presence of physical symptoms that would need to involve multiple parts of the nervous system Assessment revealing that a person’s responses differ from those typically associated with neurologic conditions When no physical cause can be found for the symptoms, and there is a known cause of stress, a diagnosis of conversion disorder may be reached. Physical symptoms must also cause significant distress and impact the person’s daily life in order for a diagnosis of conversion disorder to be made. 4",
    "conversion_disorder_treatment": "Diagnosing conversion disorder and subsequently developing trusted relationships between health practitioners and the affected person is an important first step in treatment. That relationship can be used to begin education about the condition and counseling to address the cause of the stress. 5 Reassurance that symptoms are not caused by a serious underlying condition may also go some way to easing them. If the person with conversion disorder is also suffering from anxiety or depression, this can be addressed as part of the treatment and often helps to improve the symptoms. Treatments that can be recommended for conversion disorder include: 2 Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) or counseling Hypnosis Physical therapy Occupational therapy Practicing stress-relieving techniques, such as regular light exercise and enjoyable activities, such as gardening, can be helpful in preventing the symptoms of conversion disorder. It is also helpful to have a reliable source of emotional support during times of stress.",
    "conversion_disorder_prognosis": "People affected by conversion disorder generally make a full recovery. Even without treatment, symptoms are generally short-term, usually lasting a few days to a few weeks, and often resolve themselves. However, without treatment, recurrences are common. Treatment can provide reassurance and support during times when symptoms occur and may help to identify and address the underlying psychological cause of the condition.",
    "other_names_for_conversion_disorder": "Conversion neurosis Dissociative disorder Functional neurological disorder (FND) Functional movement disorder",
    "faqs_for_conversion_disorder": "Q: Is conversion disorder a disability? A: The United States Social Security Administration recognizes somatic symptoms and related disorders as a disability. However, the qualifying criteria are quite stringent and are based on detailed evidence of the disorder in a person’s medical profile, as well as its functional impact on their ability to go about their daily routine. Q: Can conversion disorder be cured? A: While it may not be appropriate to talk of “curing” conversion disorder, symptoms can be managed effectively through proper treatment, and, in time, the underlying psychological cause of the condition can come to be understood. This may involve a combination of counseling, psychotherapy, hypnosis, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Q: Can conversion disorder be fatal? A: It is not typical for the symptoms of conversion disorder to be fatal. They can, however, be debilitating and cause significant distress. People experiencing possible symptoms of conversion disorder should speak to a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment. Q: Can conversion disorder cause seizures? A: Yes, seizures can be a symptom of conversion disorder. Classed as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), they tend to resemble those experienced as a result of epilepsy but are not caused by a disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain. Instead, PNES are caused by emotional or psychological distress. 6 7 Seizures may never be witnessed or, alternatively, only occur while the affected person is around other people. Q: Can conversion disorder come and go? A: Yes, it is typical for the symptoms of conversion disorder to last for between a number of days and a few weeks and suddenly disappear. 1 Without effective treatment, symptoms may then reoccur at a later date. Q: Can conversion disorder cause hallucinations? A: Yes, hallucinations can be a symptom of conversion disorder. A hallucination is defined as seeing, smelling, or hearing something that seems real but is not. People experiencing hallucinations should seek medical attention urgently. 9"

    "condition": "Coronary Artery Disease",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/coronary-artery-disease/",
    "what_is_coronary_artery_disease_cad": "Coronary heart disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply the heart become hardened and narrowed over time. This results in a decreased supply of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle, the myocardium. This can cause serious complications, such as heart attacks and heart failure . Coronary artery disease usually has a slow onset, often beginning during adolescence, but only becoming symptomatic much later in life, in middle age. 1 The main symptom is chest pain or pressure that can radiate to the jaw, shoulder, back or arms. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and typically involves managing other health conditions that are contributing to CAD, making lifestyle changes, using medications and, in some cases, undergoing a procedure to widen the blood vessels of the heart. These treatments can help to prevent severe complications.\n\nDeoxygenated blood is transported to the heart from the body via the vena cava, a vein, entering through the right atrium and then traveling to the right ventricle. From here,  the blood flows to the lungs, where it is oxygenated  before returning to the heart, entering the left atrium and then passing into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, oxygenated blood leaves the heart for the body via the aorta, an artery. More than 3,000 gallons of blood pass through the heart every day; 1 it is one of the only muscles in the body that never rests. The heart muscle itself is supplied with blood by the left and right coronary arteries, which branch off from the aorta near where the aorta leaves the left ventricle of the heart. The left main coronary artery supplies the left side of the heart with blood, while the right coronary artery supplies the right side. 2 If either of the coronary arteries becomes narrowed or blocked, the heart muscle does not get enough blood to supply its needs, potentially causing stable or unstable angina or heart attacks . 3",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Symptoms of coronary artery disease may include: Angina, i.e. short-lived episodes of chest pain Shortness of breath Nausea Cold sweat Dizziness. In severe cases, a heart attack may occur . Chest pain, caused by an insufficient supply of blood, is the most characteristic symptom of coronary artery disease. The severity of the symptoms vary according to the extent to which the arteries are affected, and how much oxygen the heart needs at the time the symptoms appear. Shortness of breath typically manifests if the coronary artery disease is causing acute heart failure or chronic heart failure , each of which cause fluid to build up in the lungs. Acute and chronic heart failure are not the same as a heart attack, which is technically known as myocardial infarction.\n\nA heart attack is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical care. Not all people experiencing a heart attack will have all the symptoms. The location and nature of the pain experienced during a heart attack can differ between men and women, with women more likely to feel pain in the lower chest, upper back or abdomen and to experience other symptoms such as nausea and lightheadedness. 4 Not all heart attacks involve intense chest pain, and not all heart attacks are sudden, but may come on more slowly. 5 The chest pain caused by a heart attack may: 4 6 7 Feel like burning, crushing, squeezing or fullness Be felt in the jaw, neck, arm, upper back or abdomen Cause an abnormal heartbeat Last for more than 20 minutes. Other symptoms of a heart attack include: 4 5 6 7 Nausea and vomiting Pale, mottled and clammy skin Sweating Lightheadedness or dizziness Chills Shortness of breath Anxiety and restlessness Weakness. Not everyone will experience all of these symptoms.  Medical assistance is required as soon as possible in the case of a heart attack, even if not all of these symptoms are present. For more information, see this resource on heart attacks .\n\nAngina often feels like pressure or squeezing in the chest. The pain is often located in the center of the chest and may spread to the arms and jaw. It is typically described as similar to a heart attack in sensation. Angina tends to disappear with rest and worsen if the affected person engages in activity. It is often brought on by exercise. The pain is most likely to happen during or after exertion, eating, stress or excitement, or sudden exposure to cold conditions. 8 Some people may experience angina while resting. Depending on the onset of symptoms and some other criteria, it is possible to differentiate various forms of chest pain, related to angina, caused by CAD, including: Stable angina Unstable angina Myocardial infarction Sudden cardiac death. Unstable angina and myocardial infarction cannot be differentiated by symptoms. Instead, a doctor will rely on laboratory findings and ECG. Good to know: If an episode of angina takes more than about ten minutes to pass, comes on for the first time or without warning, or if there is no identifiable cause, it is known as unstable angina . 8 9 For more information, see this resource on unstable angina. Unstable angina pectoris is a medical emergency. Although the symptoms are similar, it is not necessarily a heart attack. However, it indicates that the affected person is at high risk of having a heart attack, and medical treatment should be sought as soon as possible. 9",
    "risk_factors_and_causes": "Coronary artery disease is slightly more common in men than women and is most common in middle-aged and older adults. Important risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, drinking alcohol, obesity and having a family member who has or had coronary artery disease. In the majority of cases, the underlying cause of coronary artery diseases is atherosclerosis .Risk factors for coronary artery disease can be divided into two main groups: modifiable and non-modifiable. Non-modifiable factors cannot be changed, while modifiable factors can. Non-modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease include: 3 10 Advancing age Male sex A family history of coronary artery disease. Men are at increased risk of developing coronary artery disease after the age of 45, while women are at increased risk from the age of 55. 10 People with a family history of coronary artery disease are particularly at risk if the affected relative is a parent or a sibling. Risk factors for coronary artery disease that can be modified include: 3 10 Smoking Physical inactivity Being overweight High blood levels of LDL cholesterol Low blood levels of HDL cholesterol Diabetes and/or high blood glucose levels and/or insulin resistance High blood pressure A diet low in Vitamins C, D and E, low in fruit and vegetables, and low in Omega 3s. Sleep apnea , high stress levels, alcohol consumption and a history of preeclampsia can also increase the chances of coronary artery disease developing. For ways to modify some of these risk factors, see below. For more information on the factors that affect someone’s chance of developing coronary artery disease or other heart conditions, see this resource on cardiovascular disease risk factors .\n\nMost cases of coronary artery disease are caused by atherosclerosis , a condition in which a fatty, waxy substance known as atherosclerotic plaque builds up on the inside of the arteries, 10 forming atheromas. Atheromas are made up of fatty materials, proteins, waste materials from the blood and cholesterol. Calcium may also accumulate in atheromas. Atheromas are usually hard and fibrous on the outside. ref1 Technically, atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body; 3 the form affecting the coronary arteries is known as coronary atherosclerosis . If atheromas develop in a coronary artery, they can protrude and interrupt the flow of blood through the artery. Atheroma can harden or burst. If they harden, blood flow through the artery is reduced. If they burst, a blood clot may form on the surface of the atheroma and interrupt blood flow. A blood clot that forms in a coronary artery is called a coronary thrombus. 1 If a blood clot forms, angina can occur. If the atheroma or blood clot is large enough, blood flow through the artery may be totally cut off, causing a coronary occlusion and leading to a heart attack . Atheromas can rupture even if they are not large enough to obstruct blood flow; the thrombus that forms if this happens can further narrow or even block the artery, causing the heart muscle to cramp. For more information, see our resource on atherosclerosis . A heart attack or angina may also occur if the artery spasms and becomes narrower due to the irritation caused by a thrombus. The interruption of blood flow through the artery, whether it is caused by an atheroma, a clot, or a spasm, causes a condition known as myocardial ischemia. 8 It is ischemia that causes the chest pain characteristic of coronary artery disease. The point at which ischemia occurs changes, depending on where in the coronary artery the flow is interrupted, 11 how large the interruption is and how much oxygen the heart muscle needs at the time. Ischemia causes acute coronary syndromes such as unstable angina and heart attack. 3 ref11\n\nIn a small number of cases, coronary artery disease can result from a spasm of the coronary artery. This is known as variant angina or Prinzmetal angina. These spasms can be caused by stress, exposure to cold, smoking, the use of drugs that cause blood vessels to narrow, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the use of stimulant drugs such as cocaine or nicotine. 12 It may also result from congenital heart defects or physical damage to the coronary arteries. In some cases, systemic lupus erythematosus can cause coronary artery disease. In some people, coronary artery disease is the result of endothelial dysfunction in the coronary arteries. Endothelial dysfunction occurs when the artery does not expand to accommodate an increased demand for blood in the heart muscle, such as during exertion. 3 Arterial dissection, where a tear develops in an artery’s lining, an embolism, aneurysm or vasculitis can also cause coronary artery disease. 11",
    "diagnosing_coronary_artery_disease": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination. An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) or an exercising ECG/EKG – useful for showing heart damage that only occurs when exercising – may also be used. Blood tests for cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels can also be helpful. Rarely, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) can be performed on the heart to examine the vessels.\n\nThere are a number of tests that may be ordered if coronary artery disease is suspected. An electrocardiogram, known as an ECG or EKG, records the electrical activity in the heart, measures the heart’s rhythm and speed and may show signs of heart muscle damage. Stress testing is related to the ECG and is done in conjunction with it, as the affected person undergoes an ECG while exercising. This test will show any changes and abnormalities in heart rate, blood pressure and heart rhythm. An echocardiography uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart and to show whether the valves and chambers are working properly. It can show areas where blood flow or muscle function is compromised. Cardiac angiography , where dye is injected into the heart blood vessels via a cardiac catheter and X-rays are taken, may help identify areas of narrowing or blockage in the heart arteries. 10",
    "treatment_management_and_prevention": "Treatment depends on the specific symptoms being experienced and their severity. For people with mild, predictable chest pain symptoms, treatment will generally involve thinning the blood to prevent blockages and taking medication to help open up the blood vessels. As the condition progresses, it may be necessary to have cardiac catheterization – the insertion of a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels– in order to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels with a stent, a small wire cage. Eventually, some people may need bypass surgery. The goal of all treatment for coronary artery disease is to: 3 Reduce the heart’s workload by controlling blood pressure Improve blood flow by stretching narrowed arteries Prevent complications and symptoms, such as angina and heart attacks Slow or stop the development of atheromas Lower the risk of blood clots There are many ways to do this, including basic lifestyle changes, medication and surgical options.\n\nMaking basic lifestyle changes is one of the first steps in the long-term treatment of coronary artery disease. These changes include adopting a healthy diet, limiting alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, learning to manage stress, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough exercise. Alcohol consumption should be limited to one drink a day for women and two for men. One drink is twelve liquid ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or one and a half ounces of liquor. Smoking should be discontinued immediately upon receiving a diagnosis of coronary artery disease, if not before, and if the affected person does not smoke, they should not start. Quitting smoking considerably decreases the risk of developing CAD. It is also important to positively manage stress and responses to stressful events , especially those involving anger. Yoga, meditation and stress-management courses may be useful for this. Physical activity should be increased to at least two and a half hours a week , if not more. For people who have not been exercising, a very gradual increase in the intensity of the exercise is recommended, and activities such as walking, swimming, cycling and rowing may be best. Also, strength training helps increase general strength levels, 3 making more aerobic types of exercise such as those listed more enjoyable, which in turn improves an affected person’s likelihood of sticking to an exercise regime. 13 The affected person’s body weight should be kept within, or lowered to, a BMI of between 18 and 25. ref3 10\n\nVarious foods promote heart health, and these should be included in the diet of people who have received a diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Dietary changes can be an important first step towards lowering cholesterol and high blood pressure. Foods that are beneficial to people with CAD include: 3 10 Fish high in omega 3, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines or tuna Fresh fruit and vegetables Complex carbohydrates in the form of whole grains, which contain soluble and insoluble fibres to assist digestive function and stabilize blood glucose levels Legumes Moderate amounts of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which can be found in nut and seed-derived oils, nuts and seeds, avocado, and soy products such as tofu. Foods that should be consumed only in extreme moderation include red meat, palm and coconut oils, and high-sugar foods, snacks and drinks. These foods tend to be high in saturated fats and trans fats, which increase LDL cholesterol. Salt and high-salt foods should also be consumed only in very small amounts.\n\nAlong with lifestyle changes, medication is another long-term method of managing coronary artery disease. Medications commonly prescribed include: 14 15 Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin, which reduce the likelihood of developing a blood clot around an atheroma Statins, which lower LDL cholesterol ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II inhibitors, which lower blood pressure and have other protective effects for the heart Beta blockers to slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure and reduce the heart’s demand for oxygen Calcium-channel inhibitors, which slow heart rate and widen blood vessels Nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, which cause the arteries to relax, reducing the blood pressure and reducing the heart’s workload All of these medications have side effects, and it is important to discuss the various options and potential combinations thoroughly with the physicians who prescribe them.\n\nIn some cases, surgical measures may be needed to widen narrowed or blocked arteries, or to bypass the areas affected by arteriosclerotic blockages. The two most common procedures to do this are the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\n\nThis procedure is also known as a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. It is less invasive than CABG and effective in more than 80 percent of cases. 3 However, it is not always possible. ref3 The procedure involves a small surgical balloon being attached to a catheter and threaded into an artery in the wrist or thigh. It is then directed to the aorta and from there into the affected coronary artery. The balloon is moved into place at the point where the artery is narrowed or blocked and then inflated. The pressure of the inflation stretches the artery and flattens the atheroma. 3 Once the artery is widened and the atheroma compressed, a wire mesh tube called a stent is inserted into the widened stretch. Most stents are impregnated with a drug that prevents the artery from blocking again. Because these impregnated stents can increase the risk of blood clots, the person who has undergone the PCI will need to take an antiplatelet drug and aspirin for between three to 12 months after the procedure and continue taking aspirin for the rest of their life.\n\nThis procedure is often referred to as bypass surgery or coronary artery bypass surgery. It is an invasive procedure and requires a short hospital stay of about a week. It is more likely to result in post-surgical complications, such as stroke or heart attack, than a PCI. In this procedure, a section from another artery or vein is used to replace the affected section of coronary artery. Leg veins are often used, or arteries from the forearm. Arterial grafts seldom develop CAD. 3",
    "preventing_cad": "Preventing coronary artery disease involves lifestyle and dietary changes. Being physically active, losing weight, ceasing to smoke and excluding alcohol from the diet can all help. Good management of other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol levels can also help to prevent the progression of coronary artery disease.",
    "other_names_for_coronary_artery_disease": "CAD Coronary heart disease Ischemic heart disease",
    "faq": "Q: What should people who have the non-modifiable risk factors for CAD do? A: If you have non-modifiable risk factors, it’s a good idea to work on improving the modifiable factors by making dietary changes, quitting smoking and increasing fitness levels. It may also be a good idea to visit a doctor in order to discuss medication or other management methods. In this way, blood cholesterol levels and hypertension can be managed, reducing the heart’s workload and lowering the chance of developing CAD or complications from CAD. Q: Which age groups are particularly affected by CAD? A: Between 5 and  9 percent of all people older than 20 years of age are affected by the most common form of CAD, coronary atherosclerosis. Men and women are affected by CAD, but before menopause, women are protected by high estrogen levels. This leads to men appearing to be affected at younger ages, and this leads to the appearance of higher rates among men. After the age of 55, however, the mortality rate among men decreases. Among people aged 75 and older, more women than men have CAD. However, CAD is the leading cause of mortality among both men and women in the developed world. 3 Q: How quickly does quitting smoking benefit people with CAD or the risk factors for CAD? A: Once a person has quit smoking, their risk of stroke or heart attack decreases within weeks. Within about two years, the risk of CAD, stroke and heart attacks decreases to the same as that of someone who has never smoked. 16 Q: How is CAD related to strokes? A: Coronary heart disease and stroke share many risk factors. 17 There are two main types of stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke . Ischemic strokes result from the blockage of a blood vessel in the brain by an atheroma. Atherosclerosis is a common cause of ischemic strokes. 18 Hemorrhagic strokes are more commonly associated with high blood pressure. 19"

    "what_is_costochondritis": "Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and the breastbone. The exact cause of costochondritis is unknown. Costochondritis tends to affect women more often than men, and it can affect people of all ages, but it's slightly more common in people over 40 years of age. 1 Costochondritis symptoms may typically include chest pain that could be worsened by some activities, such as taking a deep breath. The onset of costochondritis is often chronic. Diagnosis is mainly based on a physical exam, medical imaging, and blood tests. Physical therapy and painkillers may help. As the symptoms can be like a heart attack , it's important to consult with a healthcare professional. They can offer an assessment and advice. Costochondritis is a self-limiting condition and often goes away on its own. However, it can recur.",
    "causes": "The specific cause of costochondritis is still unknown. However, in some cases, costochondritis may occur due to the following: An injury or a blow to the chest 2 Physical strain, This could be caused, for example, by strenuous exercise or lifting heavy objects Severe coughing is also linked to costochondritis 2 This could also be because of the increased strain on the chest area when coughing. An infection, including respiratory tract infections, wound infections, or through hematogenous spread. 2 3",
    "risks": "Costochondritis occurs more often in females than in males, and it tends to affect people over 40 years of age. 1 People who have had trauma to the chest are at higher risk of developing costochondritis. This is also the case for people doing high-impact activities or sports using the chest muscles, like weightlifting. Some case reports have described costochondritis in vitamin D deficient patients that resolved with vitamin D supplementation 4 , which could also be a risk factor.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of costochondritis include: Pain in the area where the rib meets the breastbone, which is known as the costochondral joint (junction). The pain could shift to the back or upper belly. It may worsen during physical activity or when taking deep breaths or coughing. Costochondritis pain locations are most common in the 2nd to 5th ribs. 3 5 Tenderness in the costochondral joint. This can be elicited by pressing on it. The tenderness can also extend to the sternoclavicular joint and the muscles around the area. 3 Other Less common symptoms include: fever sweating redness on the chest dizziness, and nausea.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis of costochondritis is usually made during a physical exam. Before a diagnosis can be confirmed, your GP may ask to carry out some tests to exclude other possible causes of chest pain. These include a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), and blood tests. 2",
    "costochondritis_vs_tietze_syndrome": "Due to the similarities in symptoms, costochondritis is often confused with Tietze syndrome. They are similar in presentation, but there are a few differences between the two conditions: Costochondritis is more common than Tietze syndrome. It occures mainly in people older than 40. It affects mostly the 2nd to 5th rib, and swelling is rarely present. On the other hand, Tietze syndrome is rarer than costochondritis. It tends to affect people younger than 40. The most common site affected is the 2nd and 3rd rib, and there is commonly a local swelling. 2 5",
    "treatment": "The main aim of the treatment is to relieve pain. Treatment of costochondritis often involves: Rest and physical therapy Avoiding activities that worsen the pain Doing stretching exercises Simple painkillers Sometimes, the condition is caused by a bacterial infection, and for these cases, treatment may include antibiotics In some cases with severe pain and if simple pain killers are unsuitable or ineffective, corticosteroid injections may be prescribed. A doctor should administer these. 2",
    "prognosis": "The prognosis for costochondritis is generally very good. It tends to get better over time without any further problems. The condition may last from weeks up to a year. 3 In some cases, the condition may return or persist even with treatment. These cases are known as chronic costochondritis."

    "covid_19_coronavirus_disease_2019": "COVID-19 is the disease resulting from infection by a new respiratory virus (SARS-CoV-2), first identified on December 8, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China as the cause of a respiratory illness outbreak. The name ‘COVID-19’ was suggested by the WHO (World Health Organization), using established guidelines. 1",
    "reported_affected_areas": "In the beginning, most cases were detected in China. Europe and North America are now epicentres of the outbreak, however, all continents are reporting an increasing number of cases. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. 2",
    "causes_and_risks": "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause infection in a variety of animal species. Bats appear to be the reservoir of the COVID-19 virus, but the intermediate host(s) has not yet been identified. 3 Coronaviruses can also spread between animals and humans, and in some cases, also between humans. This is rare, but in the past, has led to outbreaks (MERS-CoV and SARS). Initially, many of the patients in the COVID-19 outbreak were linked to a large market selling seafood and live animals – suggesting it was spread by animal-to-person contact. However, subsequent cases did not have direct exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person transmission. 4 This has been observed both within and outside of China. The disease spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are passed when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on surrounding objects and surfaces. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they inhale droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs or exhales droplets. Studies suggest that the virus is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  While investigations suggest the virus may be found in feces in some cases, the risk of fecal-oral transmission seems to be low. 5 Your risk level depends on where you live, your age, and your overall health. The majority of cases are adults, with 2 percent younger than 20 years old. Most patients (80 percent) experienced mild illness and recovered without needing special treatment. Around 14 percent experienced severe disease, and 5 percent were critically ill. 6 Approximately 2–3 percent of people with the disease have died. 5",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Typical signs and symptoms include fever, dry cough, fatigue, coughing up phlegm, and shortness of breath. Some cases also report sore throat, headache, muscle pain, and chills. More serious cases develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis , and septic shock that can lead to death. People over 60 and those with existing chronic conditions (namely hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer) seem to be more vulnerable to severe illness and death. 3 5 Current estimates of the time between infection and onset of symptoms range from one to 14 days with average estimates of five to six days. While people are mostly infectious when they show symptoms, there are indications that rarely, some people might transmit the virus without showing any symptoms or before the symptoms appear. If this is confirmed, it would make early detection of COVID-19 infections more difficult. However, it is not unusual for viral infections of this type. For example, this is also seen with measles . 7",
    "diagnosis": "Outside of mainland China, laboratory testing of respiratory samples confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection. ref4\n\nPeo ple who have a sudden onset of at least one of the following should be tested: fever cough shortness of breath. Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Areas have different outbreaks, even within the same country, and testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at a national and local level. 7 Peo ple who, in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms, fulfilled at least one of the following criteria should also be tested: close contact with a COVID-19 patient (living in the same household, healthcare-associated exposure, working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment, or traveling together) a history of traveling to areas with ongoing community transmission of COVID-19 worked in or attended a healthcare facility where patients with COVID-19 infections were being treated.\n\nAs the measures differ between countries, contact your local public health authority to get advice on what to do. Before you go to a doctor’s office or the emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travels and your symptoms, and then, follow their advice. Avoid contact with others. Do not travel while sick. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol) if soap and water are not available. 8",
    "treatment": "To date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus. However, those infected with COVID-19 should receive appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness should receive optimal supportive care. Some specific treatments are under investigation and will be tested through clinical trials. 5",
    "prevention": "At present, there is no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Avoiding exposure to the virus is the best way to prevent infection. Standard measures to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses apply, which include: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol). Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough, maintain at least a 1-metre distance (social distancing). Stay home when you are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, and then throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. 9\n\nSeveral countries 8 10 11 have restricted travel to affected areas (those which are experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19). In general, avoid non-essential travel, both to reduce individual risk, as well as to prevent quarantine measures upon return. If travel cannot be avoided, or you are already in an affected area, please note the following: Avoid contact with sick people. Discuss travel to the affected area with your healthcare provider – older adults and people with underlying health issues may be at higher risk. Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and animal products such as uncooked meat Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol). 8 For even more details, read our Ada Editorial article on the novel coronavirus where one of our doctors, Dr. Gilsdorf, answers your most commonly asked questions."

    "condition": "Cradle Cap",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cradle-cap/",
    "what_is_cradle_cap": "Cradle cap is a common skin disorder affecting newborn babies, usually those younger than three months of age. The medical name for this condition is infant seborrheic dermatitis. It is generally not uncomfortable for the infant, except in severe cases when it may be itchy. 1 Cradle cap in children, teenagers and adults is usually known as seborrheic dermatitis, or seborrhea. Seborrheic dermatitis can affect any part of the body, whereas cradle cap is usually restricted to the scalp and face\n\nCradle cap is a form of seborrheic dermatitis, which is a form of dermatitis, or skin inflammation. It is related to eczema, or atopic dermatitis , another form of dermatitis. However, seborrheic dermatitis is not as itchy or inflamed as atopic dermatitis. For more information, see this resource on atopic dermatitis. Psoriasis is not a form of dermatitis, but it is often difficult to distinguish between psoriasis and dermatitis. Psoriasis, like seborrheic or atopic dermatitis, can affect the scalp or skin fold area. It is an inflammatory skin disorder, often appearing as red skin overlaid with white, flaky areas, which leads some people to confuse it with seborrheic dermatitis. However, psoriasis is caused by an overactive immune system causing inflammation, which causes new skin cells to be produced and pushed to the surface too quickly. Because the body cannot shed these cells quickly enough, they build up on the skin surface and form red, scaly, itchy plaques. 2 Read more about plaque psoriasis here >>\n\nYes, although in older children, teenagers and adults it is generally not known as cradle cap, but is instead called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea. Dandruff of the scalp is a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis commonly found in teenagers and adults.",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Cradle cap usually occurs on the parts of the body that have the highest density of oil-producing (sebum) glands, which produce an oily, waxy substance. The parts of the body that are affected by cradle cap in babies include: 1 3 The scalp The eyelids The face, around the nose, chin, and mouth The forehead, the back of the ears, or the back of the neck In other skin folds, for example in the armpits, inner elbows, and backs of the knees The buttocks, gluteal cleft (groove between the buttocks), upper thighs, and lower abdomen (the diaper area)\n\nIn cases of seborrheic dermatitis in toddlers, older children, teenagers, and adults, other parts of the body can be affected. 4 The general appearance of cradle cap/seborrheic dermatitis is the same in infants, toddlers, children, teenagers, and adults.\n\nCradle cap usually appears as a yellow or brown scaly layer on a baby’s scalp, that may look oily or waxy. The skin usually looks normal underneath the scales. However, the appearance of cradle cap can vary. It can also present as: 1 3 5 Mild, patchy scales Extensive, thick scaly patches Thick, oily yellow scales Brown crusting patches Red skin surrounded by pink patches; this is more common in skin fold areas Swollen areas of skin - more common in skin folds Cradle cap is not the result of bacteria, an allergy or an infection and should not feel hot to the touch, itch, smell or weep fluids . If the rash feels warm, smells bad or weeps fluids, infection may have occurred , 1 and medical help should be sought. 4\n\nHowever, although cradle cap is not always itchy, other skin conditions affecting babies do itch. These include diaper rash and atopic dermatitis , as well as ringworm. If you are concerned that your baby may have a skin condition, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nCradle cap is most common in babies younger than six months of age and often appears within the first few weeks of life. It usually goes away once the baby is older than nine months of age. In older children, conditions that cause symptoms that look like cradle cap include: 6 Atopic dermatitis Impetigo Psoriasis Contact dermatitis including diaper rash Ringworm\n\nCradle cap can spread to the diaper area, but diaper rash is a separate condition , which manifests as irritated, tender and red skin. This is caused by the infant’s skin coming into contact with a diaper that is soiled by urine or feces. 7 Babies with diaper rash tend to be irritable because of the discomfort. 8 For more information, see this resource on diaper rash.",
    "what_causes_cradle_cap_in_babies_and_adults": "What causes cradle cap is not entirely certain, but in babies it may be the result of overactive oil-producing sebaceous glands , which are stimulated by the mother’s hormones. 3 These glands produce sebum, an oily or waxy substance that lubricates and waterproofs the skin. Another factor contributing to cradle cap or seborrhea in adults may be the colonization of the sebaceous glands by natural yeasts, 3 specifically particular subspecies of the genus Malassezia. 5 It is possible that these yeasts do not cause cradle cap, but rather take advantage of the overproduction of sebum that is already happening. 6 It is also likely that stress, chemical irritants and dry, cold weather may play a role in causing cradle cap. 1 Cradle cap is not caused by bacteria, allergies, lack of hygiene or lack of care. ref1 It is not contagious. 3 Cradle cap can be treated quite easily and will usually clear up within a few weeks or months. In older people, cradle cap, or seborrheic dermatitis, can be caused by the same factors that lead to the condition in infants.",
    "diagnosis": "To diagnose cradle cap or seborrheic dermatitis, a doctor will make a visual inspection of the affected skin. Blood and other laboratory tests are not usually needed. However, if the condition does not improve with treatment, it is possible that it is not cradle cap or seborrhea, but something that looks similar such as psoriasis or an allergic reaction. In such cases it may be necessary to return to the doctor and possibly undergo tests to determine what is causing the problem.",
    "how_is_cradle_cap_treated": "Mild cradle cap can be treated at home with easily available remedies like baby shampoo, baby oil, or almond or olive oil. A pharmacist may recommend trying petroleum jelly or coal tar shampoo. In most cases, these monitoring and home remedies do work. However, if the rash bleeds, oozes fluid, is hot to the touch or spreads extensively, it is very important to see a  doctor. In more severe cases, a doctor may prescribe: 11 Topical steroids such as hydrocortisone Antifungals such as ketoconazole or imidazole\n\nHome remedies can be effective in reducing discomfort and improving symptoms of mild or moderate cradle cap. More severe, or persistent, cases may need specialized treatments prescribed by a doctor.  How long treatment is necessary for depends on the method being used and how severe the condition is.\n\nCradle cap in babies can be treated at home. One way to treat cradle cap is to warm a small amount of clean, natural oil such as jojoba, almond, coconut or olive oil, and massage it into the affected area. After 15 minutes, the flakes can be gently brushed off. The area should then be thoroughly shampooed, with special care taken to ensure that no oil remains on the skin. 3 Flakes can be removed from the skin by softly brushing with a soft brush or terry cloth towel. Do not scratch the scalp with fingernails or other implements, as this may break the skin. White petroleum jelly can be applied daily to the baby’s scalp and is known to soften scales, which can then be brushed off. Regular washing with baby shampoo is also useful. 5 In some cases, coal tar shampoo may be used, but this can sometimes irritate the skin. The same is true for shampoos devised to control dandruff on adult scalp; as these can sting, they are not very suitable for use on babies. 11 6\n\nSevere, persistent or recurrent infantile seborrheic dermatitis can be treated with shampoos, creams, and gels. Hydrocortisone, imidazole or ketoconazole are all available as prescription creams or gels for use in the treatment of severe cases of cradle cap. Imidazole or ketoconazole creams are applied several times a week, while hydrocortisone cream is applied daily. 12",
    "prevention": "Cradle cap cannot be prevented. However, it is easily treated and need not affect the infant’s quality of life. Not all infants will be affected by cradle cap. Some ways of reducing the chance of skin irritation include: Making sure that all traces of shampoo, soap or cleansers are rinsed off the body during bathing, to reduce the chance of skin irritation Dressing the baby in well-fitting clothing that allows air to circulate, reducing the chances of skin irritation Choosing clothes made of natural rather than artificial fibers, as these improve air circulation and moisture regulation",
    "faqs": "Q: Does cradle cap itch? A: Cradle cap in babies can, but does not always, itch. Adults with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, ears and/or body appear to be more itchy than babies with cradle cap of the scalp. Severe cases of cradle cap do itch. Q: Can cradle cap cause hair loss? A: In cases of significant cradle cap or seborrheic dermatitis, sometimes the process of brushing or combing the scalp to loosen and remove scales can cause some hair to come away along with the scales. 13 While this may be distressing to the adults concerned, the hair will grow back and the hair loss is therefore only temporary. 14 Q: Does cradle cap have a smell? A: In some cases, cradle cap may have a slight oily smell. This is due to the buildup of oil/sebum from sebaceous glands that causes cradle cap. However, cradle cap should not have an unpleasant smell. 15 If an unpleasant smell is detected, the rash may have been infected by bacteria, and the affected person should be examined by a doctor or nurse. Q: Can cradle cap cause sores? A: Generally, cradle cap manifests only as oily flakes. Occasionally, the skin beneath the flakes is red and swollen. However, if the skin begins to weep, feels hot, and develops sores, it is possible that the skin has become infected or may become infected by bacteria, and the affected person should be examined by a doctor or nurse. Q: Can cradle cap be black in color? A: No. If black spots are appearing on the scalp, it is not simple cradle cap - a fungal infection may be affecting the scalp. The affected person should be examined by a doctor to determine exactly what might be causing the spots. An antifungal cream may be prescribed if the cause is a fungal infection. 16 Q: Can cradle cap come back once it has cleared up? A: In babies, cradle cap usually clears up on its own by the age of six months. It may recur after treatment, possibly several times, until the oil-producing glands settle down. Q: Can cradle cap come back in later life? A: There is some evidence that people who had cradle cap as infants may experience a recurrence of the problem at puberty. When affecting older people, cradle cap is known as seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea. Teenagers and adults who have seborrheic dermatitis may have recurrent flare-ups throughout life. Often these flares are triggered by cold, dryness, or stress. 4 Q: Is there a link between cradle cap/seborrheic dermatitis and thrush? A: Thrush is caused by a kind of yeast called Candida, which often affects the genital area but can also colonize other parts of the body. In some people, especially those with HIV-related seborrheic dermatitis, there appears to be some evidence that having candida in the gut may increase the risk of developing seborrheic dermatitis. 17 Q: Can cradle cap affect facial hair, such as eyebrows, beards and mustaches? A: Yes. In adults, seborrheic dermatitis can affect the facial skin beneath facial hair. In infants, the skin beneath the hair of the eyebrows can be affected."

    "what_is_crohn_s_disease": "Crohn’s disease is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The other main form of IBD is ulcerative colitis (UC). Crohn’s disease is believed to be caused by an overactive immune response which results in inflammation within the digestive system. When this inflammation develops, the affected person will typically experience debilitating symptoms, which may include bowel obstructions, nausea, chronic diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\n\nMost commonly, the inflammation within the digestive system which occurs in Crohn’s disease affects sections of the terminal ileum ‒ the final segment of the small intestine ‒ and/or the colon ‒ the large intestine ‒ but it can affect any of the gastrointestinal organs. Crohn’s disease usually develops in adulthood but can, in some cases, manifest in childhood or adolescence. 1 It is a lifelong, chronic condition. People affected by Crohn’s disease experience periods of: Remission, in which the disease is inactive and the individual is without symptoms Flare-ups, in which the disease is active and symptoms are present Treatment for Crohn’s disease aims to alleviate the symptoms and prolong periods of remission.",
    "crohn_s_disease_symptoms": "A person who is affected by Crohn’s disease may experience a wide range of symptoms which may also vary in severity. Common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include: 2\n\nThis takes the form of abdominal pain and cramping and often occurs one or two hours after eating, but may occur at any time. People with Crohn’s disease often avoid eating or eat less in order to avoid digestive discomfort, which can lead to weight loss. Digestive discomfort is usually at its worst when an individual is experiencing a flare-up of the disease. 3\n\nThis is one of the main symptoms of Crohn’s disease and happens when the gut cannot absorb all the necessary fluid from food during the digestive process. This often creates a sense of urgency and needing to rush to the toilet. 4\n\nA high percentage of people with Crohn’s disease are affected by fatigue. 5 This may be caused by lack of sleep , which in people with Crohn’s disease is common due to digestive discomfort, high stress levels, depression and using medication of which insomnia and/or discomfort are side effects. 6 Fatigue may also be caused by malnutrition which is a common consequence of Crohn’s disease, as the inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can result in a less efficient uptake of the essential compounds derived from food, which the body needs in order to function properly. People with Crohn’s disease are commonly found to be deficient in iron, vitamin B12 and vitamin D. 7 These deficiencies often correlate to a loss in muscle strength. 8 If you or a loved one is feeling tired for unknown reasons, you get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nCrohn’s disease typically causes bleeding in the lower digestive tract, which manifests as bright red blood in one’s stools. The condition may also cause bleeding in the colon, associated with inflammation, anal fissures and fistulas. 9\n\nA healthy intestine produces a certain amount of mucus in order to protect and lubricate the bowel area. When a person is affected by Crohn’s disease, the production of mucus can increase, resulting in surplus mucus emerging with one’s stools. This usually takes the form of a gel-like material which appears to coat the stool. 10\n\nDue to avoiding certain foods or food groups and failing to absorb sufficient energy from one’s food as a result of malabsorption and diarrhea, people with Crohn’s disease frequently experience weight loss.\n\nLess common symptoms of Crohn’s disease include: 2 Nausea and vomiting High temperature and/or being prone to fevers Swelling and pain in the joints Mouth ulcers Skin irritation involving redness, swelling and itching Uveitis, i.e. red and irritated eyes",
    "crohn_s_disease_causes": "Approximately 1.6 million people in the U.S. are affected by either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, the other prominent form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 11 The exact reasons why Crohn’s disease develops in people are unknown , but it is believed to be the result of an interaction of possible factors. When it encounters environmental or genetic factors or a combination of the two, the immune system can be triggered, resulting in the inflammation associated with Crohn’s disease. Foreign substances (antigens) which one encounters, particularly those related to smoking tobacco and to one’s diet, may irritate and cause inflammation in the intestines, resulting in the development of Crohn’s disease. Alternatively, these stimuli may correlate to an autoimmune response, whereby the body’s immune system causes areas of the gastrointestinal system to become inflamed.",
    "crohn_s_disease_risk_factors": "Anyone can be affected by Crohn’s disease, but it is most likely to manifest in people between the ages of 10 and 40. Factors which increase one’s risk of experiencing Crohn’s disease include: Being of European descent, in particular of Ashkenazi Jewish origin) 12 Smoking tobacco 13 Being female 14 Genetic factors; having an affected family member is a significant risk factor for developing Crohn’s disease, but the exact inheritance pattern for the condition is unknown",
    "crohn_s_disease_diagnosis": "People often experience the symptoms of Crohn’s disease for many years before being diagnosed with the condition. In order to establish a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, doctors will consider a person’s medical history and symptoms and will also perform a physical examination. They will often also conduct laboratory studies and further tests in order to establish the nature and severity of the condition. Diagnostic techniques for Crohn’s disease include: 15\n\nDoctors will make a full survey of the affected person’s medical history, including when their symptoms began, their dietary habits, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), history of smoking and whether they have a family history of Crohn’s disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Doctors will pay particular attention to noting whether they have been affected by appendicitis.\n\nThis will take into account an individual’s height, weight, sex, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and will include a digital-rectal examination, an examination of the abdomen, as well as a survey of the eyes, joints, heartbeat, lungs, back, pulse, and the skin and muscles, where extraintestinal symptoms of Crohn’s disease may be found.\n\nThese will be performed in order to test one’s levels of electrolytes and creatinine, and a full blood count (FBC) test will be carried out to detect infection and anemia. Tests will also be performed to establish one’s levels of nitrogen, bilirubin , transferrin vitamin B12 and folic acid. Doctors will also prescribe tests to determine the individual’s erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the rate at which red blood cells coagulate), liver function tests and a urine strip to test for irregularities in the content of their urine.\n\nImaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans will be used to screen extraintestinal symptoms such as fistulas, abscesses or sclerosing cholangitis (liver disease). People who are suspected of having Crohn’s disease will often undergo an ileocolonoscopy, in which a tube-like device containing a camera is passed through the colon in order to examine the ileum, and/or an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in which the tube-like device is swallowed in order to examine problems relating to the upper gastrointestinal tract. If it is not possible to scan the terminal ileum using conventional imaging studies, a wireless capsule endoscopy may be prescribed, which involves swallowing a small device containing a camera. This is often used to investigate unexplained bleeding in the gastrointestinal area. 16\n\nBiopsy samples will be taken from at least five segments of the gastrointestinal tract will be taken during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to investigate the extent of the inflammation, and the inflammatory cell infiltrate, lymphocytes and plasma cells.\n\nStool samples will be taken to test for the presence of bacteria called Clostridium difficile, which cause diarrhea and gastrointestinal conditions.\n\nThese studies will be performed via stool samples to identify the microorganisms, including pathogens and members of the indigenous microbiota, which may be present in an individual’s gastrointestinal system and which may initiate or propagate the inflammatory process characteristic of Crohn’s disease. 17 The testing process to determine a definitive diagnosis of Crohn’s disease is thorough. This is due to the fact that the condition is one of many, which are associated with pain and cramping in the abdomen.\n\nConditions which are often confused with Crohn’s disease, and which will be ruled out during the course of the diagnostic process include: Stomach ulcers Gastritis (stomach irritation) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which has similar symptoms to Crohn’s disease, but is a much less serious condition, which does not result in damage to the intestine Gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) Appendicitis Ulcerative colitis , the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease The final step in the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease involves collecting information to devise a treatment plan for the affected individual. This assessment will be performed by a doctor specialising in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, called a gastroenterologist. This initial assessment will establish: 18 The extent of the disease Complications such as fistulae and stricturing Nutritional status and deficiencies Bone density and the corresponding risk of conditions such as osteoporosis",
    "crohn_s_disease_treatment": "There is currently no cure for Crohn’s disease, but t here are many treatment options available to alleviate the symptoms . Treatment for Crohn’s disease focuses on: Treating the symptoms Minimising flare ups Maintaining periods of remission With effective treatment, many people with Crohn’s disease will experience significant periods, possibly several years, without symptoms. For people with more severe forms of the condition, and for whom medications do not provide significant relief from the symptoms, surgery may be required.\n\nInitial treatment of Crohn’s disease will usually involve the prescription of steroid medications (corticosteroids), which are used to reduce inflammation. These may take the form of tablets or injections, depending on what is determined to be suitable for the affected individual. 19 However, long-term usage of corticosteroids is associated with problematic side effects , which may include: Swelling of the face Unwanted weight gain Increased susceptibility to infections Bone density loss and resultant osteoporosis When a person embarks on a course of corticosteroid medication, an aim of this treatment will usually be to reduce the dose over time, so as to minimise one’s exposure to harmful side effects. Good to know: As an alternative to corticosteroids, some people may be prescribed a milder steroid or a type of medication called a 5-aminosalicylate. However, these tend to be less effective at alleviating gastrointestinal inflammation.\n\nFor individuals, whose growth and development may have been affected by Crohn’s disease, a polymeric (liquid) diet administered through a nasogastric tube may be recommended as an initial treatment. Many studies have been undertaken, comparing the polymeric diet to steroid medication, and it is considered an equally effective first-line treatment for Crohn’s disease. 20 A polymeric diet will be prescribed in order to allow the digestive system to recover from being inflamed and to support the uptake of nutrients, a process which is often compromised by the inflammation that is characteristic of Crohn's disease. 20 A person who has been prescribed a polymeric diet will progress to slowly reintroducing solid foods into their diet in a controlled setting, in order to safeguard the period of remission facilitated by undertaking the liquid diet. 21\n\nIf a person, who is being treated with corticosteroids or the polymeric diet, experiences a flare up of their symptoms twice or more during one year, or finds that they return when their steroid dose is reduced, medicines which suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants) may be prescribed in combination with the initial course of treatment. The immunosuppressant medications which are most commonly prescribed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease are azathioprine and mercaptopurine. They work by damping down the over-activity of the cells within the immune system. 22 An alternative immunosuppressant medication is methotrexate. Methotrexate is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It is vital that a blood test is performed before immunosuppressant medication is prescribed. A high score on this test relating to factors such as an elevated white blood cell count and increased lymph production, may indicate immunosuppressant toxicity, which means that these medications are not suitable for the affected individual. 23 People who are using immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of Crohn’s disease will undergo regular blood tests in order to ensure that the medication continues to agree with them, so that their use can be discontinued if needed, averting the presence of unwanted side effects.Possible side effects of immunosuppressant medication include: Nausea and vomiting Susceptibility to infection Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Liver problems Anemia , characterised by feeling tired, breathless and weak\n\nBiologic therapies are a type of immunosuppressant medications which use substances, such as antibodies and enzymes, to inhibit the effects of Crohn’s disease. The development of biologic therapies therefore presents a breakthrough alternative treatment option for those who are unwilling or unable to use steroid medication. Historically, people with Crohn’s disease and other types of IBD faced a lack of effective treatment options. Corticosteroid therapy does not alleviate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease in all cases and for those whose symptoms do not respond to it, prolonged systemic corticosteroid therapy and surgery were previously the only options. 24 If a person responds well to biologic therapy, its benefits may include: Removal of the need to use steroid medication, thereby avoiding its side effects Prolonged periods in which the disease is in remission Potential delay or negation of the need for surgery to redress intestinal damage caused by Crohn’s disease\n\nMedical opinion is divided as to whether biologic therapies should be a first-line treatment option, and many doctors prefer to investigate whether a case of Crohn’s disease can be treated with corticosteroids, a liquid diet or traditional immunosuppressants initially, before considering biologic therapy. The principal reason that some doctors prefer to prescribe traditional treatment methods first is that less is understood about the mechanism of action of biologic medications, and how different people will respond to them. Allergic reactions to the medications used in biologic therapies may occur –immediately or months after stopping treatment – and these can be life-threatening.\n\nThe two medications used in biologic therapy for Crohn’s disease are Infliximab and Adalimumab. These medications are considered to be broadly comparable in terms of their effectiveness in bringing about prolonged periods of remission and preventing the development of complications, such as intestinal obstructions, which require surgery. 25 Both children and adults can be prescribed Infliximab but Adalimumab is only suitable for adults. Both medications are usually prescribed on a twelve month course. After this, the need to continue will be reviewed, based on the individual’s response and the stability of the periods of remission following dosing. Infliximab is administered as an infusion via a drip into a vein and requires one to visit a hospital to receive the medication as an outpatient procedure. Adalimumab can be administered as an injection and one can learn to do this independently or with the help of another person, meaning that hospital visits are not necessary in order to redose. Doctors will advise on the type of medication that is appropriate in each individual case of Crohn’s disease.\n\nThe type of surgical procedure which will be prescribed in this case is called a resection. Doctors will consider performing a resection to remove the inflamed sections of the intestinal tract in cases where the symptoms of Crohn’s disease have not been alleviated by other treatments. A resection is a major procedure and usually performed under general anaesthetic. When the inflamed sections of the intestine have been removed, the healthy sections will be stitched together.\n\nAn ileostomy is a procedure which involves diverting one’s digestive waste away from the colon in order to give the area, which has undergone a resection, a chance to heal. 26 This can be temporary or permanent. The type of ileostomy prescribed as an adjunct to a resection is usually a loop ileostomy, a temporary version of ileostomy, performed under general anaesthetic, which will be reversed after the body has had a chance to recover from undergoing resection surgery. 27 In a loop ileostomy, an opening in the lower abdominal area, called a stoma, is surgically created. An ileostomy bag, also called a colostomy bag or pouch, is then attached to the small intestine through the stoma. The bag hangs outside the body and collects the waste products that would otherwise have passed into one’s large intestine and out of one’s rectum. 27 Normal function of the digestive system will be restored when the ileostomy is reversed. A loop ileostomy is not always necessary as an accompaniment to a resection. One’s physician will advise on whether the procedure is needed.",
    "crohn_s_disease_self_care": "A person's lifestyle, exercise routine and diet plan will generally need to be tailored to their individual needs as determined by their condition, and may need to be adjusted according to their symptoms. Managing Crohn’s disease can involve: Maintaining periods of remission Making lifestyle adjustments to accommodate medical appointments Management of pain and digestive discomfort Co-ordinating an appropriate lifestyle whilst undergoing treatment Surgery aftercare Changing one’s diet after surgery may be necessary. A potential outcome of surgery for Crohn’s disease is short bowel syndrome, a condition in which malabsorption occurs due to lack of a functional small intestine. Short bowel syndrome, when present, develops in the recovery period after an intestinal resection. The likelihood of a person developing problems associated with malabsorption increases, the more intestinal tissue is removed. In order to ensure that the affected person receives as much nutritional benefit from their food as possible, doctors will advise on the most appropriate food plan for each person, in order to reduce the chances of vitamin and mineral deficiencies after surgery.\n\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic condition, which means that one must make certain adjustments to one’s lifestyle, including accepting that treatment and management of the condition will always be a part of one’s life. One may find it helpful to educate one’s loved ones and co-workers about the condition, so that they are understanding when one has to miss commitments or take time off work due to a flare-up. People with Crohn’s disease will undergo periods when they need to attend frequent medical appointments for tests and/or treatment, and even when one is in a period of remission, one may need to attend checkups and periodic screenings for conditions, such as bowel cancer and osteoporosis, for which Crohn’s disease is a risk factor. It is therefore important to establish a good working relationship with one’s gastroenterologist. Travelling with Crohn’s disease will require advance planning in order to ensure that one has, or is able to access, the pharmaceuticals that one is using to manage the condition. It is recommended that one identifies in advance how to seek medical attention in one’s destination location in the event of a flare-up. Knowing the location of nearby restrooms can be helpful to people with Crohn’s disease as one is prone to diarrhea and may need to access a restroom rapidly. Checking the location of public restrooms in advance when visiting a new area is recommended, in order to ensure that toilets are accessible when needed.\n\nIt is important for everybody to engage in a certain amount of physical activity in order to maintain a healthy body. This includes people who are affected by Crohn’s disease. However, inflammation, fatigue and urgency are all factors which mean that an individual with Crohn’s disease will need to identify the appropriate fitness plan for them. Physical activity which is too intense may exacerbate the inflammation in people affected by Crohn’s disease. There has not been significant research into the ideal types and intensities of physical activity for different levels of severity of Crohn’s disease. However, a recent review of current research suggests that a personalized exercise plan would be ideal. 28 This should be devised taking into account factors such as: 28 Age Fitness level Exercise goals Preferences Severity of one’s Crohn’s disease and associated needs, such as proximity to restrooms The types of activity which have been found convenient and helpful for people with Crohn’s disease, include: 28 Aerobic activity, especially walking Muscular resistance training, which can be carried out at home, if necessary\n\nThere is currently no dietary template to follow in order to minimize the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. Individuals react differently to different foodstuffs, and everybody will find it helpful to avoid particular foods, which appear to aggravate their symptoms. However, there are some general principles which are widely acknowledged to be helpful in preventing flare-ups of Crohn’s disease symptoms, including: Eating smaller meals which are easier to digest Drinking plenty of water Keeping a food diary to ensure a balanced diet and to track adverse reactions to particular foods Monitoring one’s fiber intake to discern whether high-fiber products trigger one’s symptoms Choosing low-fat products Avoiding foods which produce excessive bloating and gas",
    "complications_from_crohn_s_disease": "In addition to experiencing the immediate symptoms of Crohn’s disease, people with the condition are also predisposed to further health complications.Related conditions which commonly affect people with Crohn’s disease include:\n\nThis condition is also referred to as bowel obstruction. Over time, the inflammation of the digestive tract in people with Crohn’s disease can cause the wall of the affected area(s) of the small or large intestine to thicken permanently. This can cause the intestine to become blocked. Intestinal obstructions can be fatal if left untreated and often require surgical removal. 29\n\nThis is a tear or sore which can occur in the anal canal. Anal fissures are common in people with Crohn’s disease, due to the trauma which is caused to the area by frequent bowel movements. 30\n\nAn anal abscess is an infected cavity filled with pus. Abscesses can affect the anus or rectum as a result of the internal glands in the anus becoming infected. This is likely to occur in people with Crohn’s disease, as the tissue in this area is often traumatized due to frequent bowel movements. 31\n\nThe inflammation caused by Crohn’s disease often creates ulcers, leaks and abscesses in the bowel wall. The more severe the inflammation, the more likely it is that one of these abrasions will develop into a hole, which then forms a fistula. A fistula is a tunnel which forms between two parts of the bowel or between the bowel and the outer skin or between the bowel and other surrounding hollow areas or organs, such as the bladder or vagina, which are not normally connected to the bowel. 32 The larger a fistula is, the more likely it is to become infected. This can cause problems like irritation of the skin and leakage of feces into or from the space which has been connected to the bowel. 32 If you suspect you may have this condition, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nThis condition often occurs in people with Crohn’s disease, due to the bleeding in the digestive tract, and because malabsorption can cause a person’s iron levels to become deficient. It is associated with shortness of breath, fatigue and a pale complexion. 33 Read more about Ireon Deficiency Anemia »\n\nOsteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton, in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. This can lead to the bones becoming weak, fragile and prone to painful fractures (breaks). In people with Crohn’s disease, osteoporosis can occur due to the intestines failing to absorb sufficient nutrients to support healthy bone growth, or due to the use of steroid medication, which may be used in the treatment of Crohn’s disease. Read more about Osteoporosis »\n\nOften signalled by fatigue and a lack of energy, vitamin B12 deficiency is likely to occur in people with Crohn’s disease due to malabsorption. Read more about Vitamin B12 Deficiency »\n\nThis is a treatable, non-infectious skin condition, 34 characterised by painful ulcers, which typically develop purple or blue edges, and may ooze fluid. They most commonly occur on the legs.\n\nPeople affected by Crohn’s disease are at an increased risk of blood clots forming, which may result in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism if left untreated. The link between hypercoagulability and Crohn’s disease is not yet fully understood, but recent research suggests that imbalances between the levels of clotting and thinning agents in the blood caused by inflammation from Crohn’s disease, contributes to the development of the condition. 35\n\nPeople whose Crohn’s disease affects their colon have a slightly increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. It is advisable to attend regular checkups and to undergo a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer. The average risk of someone developing colorectal cancer in their lifetime is about 4.5 percent. The risk once a person has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease is as follows: 36 After 10 years, 3 percent are likely to have developed colorectal cancer After 20 years, 6 percent are likely to have developed colorectal cancer After 30 years, 8 percent are likely to have developed colorectal cancer People with Crohn’s disease are advised to attend regular medical checkups in general, which should assist with the early identification and treatment of any associated conditions that arise. Read more about colorectal cancer »\n\nPeople who are affected by Crohn’s disease can normally follow their usual treatment plan during pregnancy . Most of the medications and treatment protocols, which are normally prescribed for people with Crohn’s disease, are suitable for pregnant women, with the exception of methotrexate, a type of immunosuppressant medication. 37 Regarding the development of the fetus, Crohn’s disease has been associated with the following possible risks: 37 Low birth weight Preterm delivery Stillbirth Small gestational age It is strongly recommended that both men and women with Crohn’s disease be in a period of remission at the point of conception. This will maximize the likelihood that the pregnancy will progress with no complications, and that the fetus will develop healthily. 38",
    "crohn_s_disease_faqs": "Q: Does Crohn’s disease reduce one’s life expectancy? A: In many cases, people with Crohn’s disease are able to live a normal lifespan, due to the extent to which treatments are now successfully able to mitigate the symptoms of Crohn’s disease. 39 Q: How is Crohn’s disease different from ulcerative colitis? A: Ulcerative colitis is the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and shares several important characteristics with Crohn’s disease. They are both chronic (long-term) conditions which involve inflammation of the gut and fatigue. However, ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine, whereas Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system. 40 The two conditions differ in their symptoms. People with Crohn’s disease may produce stools containing mucus, blood and/or undigested fats, whereas stool samples from people with ulcerative colitis are more likely to contain only mucus and/or blood. Tenesmus (rectal pain) is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis than Crohn’s disease, whereas fistulae and weight loss are more likely to occur in cases of Crohn’s disease. It is common for someone with Crohn’s disease to experience regular fevers, 41 whereas this would be symptomatic of a severe flare-up in someone with ulcerative colitis. 42 Q: Is there a cure for Crohn’s disease? A: There is not currently a cure for Crohn’s disease. However, many people with the condition are able to achieve periods of remission, which last years or even decades due to accessing effective treatment options. With regard to developing a cure, a recent study has built on existing research into available treatments for Crohn’s disease. The findings suggest that alternative mechanisms, which can permanently intercept the workings of the disease, may be developed by 2030. 43"

    "what_is_cryptorchidism": "Cryptorchidism is also known as undescended testicles (UDT), or undescended testes, and is usually medically defined as a condition in which a testis is not in the scrotum and doesn’t descend into the scrotum by the time the baby is four months old. 1 It is the most common congenital abnormality of the male genitalia 2 and affects about three in every ten male infants born prematurely. 3 Between one and six percent of all male babies are affected. Usually, the condition is unilateral, affecting only one testis. Rarely, the disorder is bilateral, affecting both testes. ref1 4 Most cases are idiopathic, which means that the cause is unknown. 5 Cryptorchidism is not painful for the infant, and in eight out of ten cases it resolves without medical intervention. Most cases of cryptorchidism are diagnosed during the routine checks that the baby undergoes at birth. The others are usually diagnosed during infancy, childhood or early adolescence. 4 If you think that you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of chryptorchidism, get an assessment with the free Ada app .\n\nThe testicles develop in two main phases while in utero. The first phase, which is controlled by male hormones known as androgens, occurs between the eighth and 15th weeks of gestation. 6 During this phase, the testicles develop, but are held in the fetus’s abdominal cavity by a ligament that allows very little movement. 4 ref6 It is relatively rare for complications to happen during this phase. The second phase takes place between 25 and 35 weeks of gestation, when the testicles begin to migrate towards the scrotum. 7 Most cases of cryptorchidism develop in this phase. 6 However, in the vast majority of infant males, both testicles are present in the scrotal sac at birth. In approximately 80 percent of cases of cryptorchidism, one or both scrotal sacs are empty at birth. 4 In most cases where the testes have not descended by the time the baby is born, they will have descended by the age of three months, due a postnatal surge in testosterone levels . However, if they have not done so by the time the baby is six months old, it is unlikely that they will do so on their own. 1 There are various forms of cryptorchidism: Arrested testicle: one or both testes stay in the inguinal canal (85% of cases), abdomen, or retroperineum. 8 Ectopic testicle: in which one or both testes descend normally but are diverted to an aberrant position. Absent testicle: in which the testis does not develop. Ascending testicle: in which the testes are originally in a normal scrotal position, and then “ascend” and become undescended. This can require surgery to correct. There is also a special form, known as retractile testes, in which the testes are pulled up out of the scrotum. They can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum. Retractile testes are quite common and no reason for concern.\n\nIn some cases, what appears to be an undescended testicle may in fact be a retractile or ascended testicle. These tend to be more common in older children than they are in infants. A retractile testis occurs when the cremasteric reflex is oversensitive, and generally does not need treatment as the testis is otherwise present and descended. A retracted testis can usually be manipulated back into the scrotum and remain there without being held in place. The condition is usually resolved completely by the time puberty begins. 9 Boys with this condition need to be monitored for ascending testes, but there is usually no cause for concern. In cases where the testicles do not descend into the scrotum of their own accord, medical intervention is necessary to ensure that they do so. Testicles that are not present in the scrotal sac suffer heat stress and may be at higher risk of infertility and developing cancer. 1 10",
    "causes": "Most cases of cryptorchidism have no obvious cause.\n\nRisk factors for having a male infant with undescended testicles include: 2 6 10 11 Premature birth Low birth weight A family history of undescended testicles, particularly in a father or brother Maternal exposure to chemicals, such as diethystilbestrol, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, phthalates, and dioxins, polyvinyl chloride, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), or bisphenol A (BPA) Existing congenital malformations of the urinary system or abdominal wall, such as bladder exstrophy 12 , prune-belly syndrome, 13 gastroschisis, 14 or hypospadias Hereditary syndromes affecting the hypothalamus, connective tissues or nervous system Consanguinity of parents",
    "diagnostic_procedures": "As cryptorchidism is largely asymptomatic, most cases are discovered by caregivers or physicians doing routine physical examinations. If the infant is warm and relaxed, but the testes are not present in the scrotum, they may have undescended testicles. 11 In some cases, especially if the infant is cold, surprised or upset, the cremasteric reflex 15 may cause the testicles to retract out of the scrotum into the body. If this happens, the examination will have to be repeated when the infant is warm and calm. The majority, around 80 percent, of undescended testicles are palpable (can be felt) during physical examination, due to their location in the neck of the scrotum. If they are in the abdomen or inguinal canal, they may be non-palpable. In such cases, a laparoscopic examination may be necessary to locate them. A laparoscopic exam involves inserting a laparoscope, a thin and flexible device with a camera, into the inguinal canal or abdomen. In some cases, if the cryptorchidism affects both testicles (bilateral) and the testes are non-palpable, the infant may need to be assessed for a possible disorder or sexual differentiation. In such rare cases, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to locate the undescended testicles, especially if they are in the abdomen. 4 In rare cases, only one testicle may be present. This is known as monorchidism. Complete absence of testicles, known as anorchia, is extremely uncommon. 1 Ideally, undescended testes should be located and treatment begun before the infant reaches one year of age. 1 Early treatment gives the testicle the best chance of developing normally, maintaining fertility and minimizing the risk of testicular cancer. 4",
    "treatment_options": "Undescended testicles must be treated if they have not descended spontaneously by the time the child is six months of age. After that age, they are unlikely to descend on their own. The goal of treatment for undescended testicles is to move viable undescended testes to the correct position in the scrotum and to remove nonviable testicular tissue if it is present. The usual course of treatment is almost always surgery, known as orchidopexy, although in some cases, hormonal treatment may be possible.\n\nIn cases where the testicle is palpable, the testis can be repositioned using a procedure known as an orchidopexy. The testicle needs to be palpable for this surgery to be an option. In an orchidopexy, which is usually performed between the ages of six months and 11 years of age, the undescended testicle is brought into the scrotum, along with the vas deferens, 16 testicular blood vessels and spermatic cord. It is then fixed in the scrotum with sutures. 4 This procedure can be done laparoscopically or by open surgery. It is usually done through an incision in the inguinal area,the groin. ref1 If the undescended testis is not palpable, exploratory surgery is performed to determine whether the testis is present at all and then, if it is, whether it is viable. This exploratory surgery can be open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. 17 If the testis is present and viable, a laparoscopic orchidopexy can be performed. In this case, a laparoscope — a small, slender instrument equipped with a light and a camera — will be used to locate the testis and then guide the procedure to bring it into position. Open surgery is not usually performed in cases where the exact location of the testis is unknown. 1 If the testicle is high in the abdomen, complications may occur because the blood vessels and spermatic cord may not be long enough to allow movement into the scrotum. 17 If it is discovered that no testes are present, or that only one is present, any atrophied testicular tissue that is found will be removed. Orchidopexies should be performed as early as possible to maximize fertility potential in later life and keep the risk of testicular cancer to a minimum. Also, they are easier to do if the child is still physically small, as the distances that the vessels and organs need to be moved are shorter. 4 Surgery in the form of orchidopexy is considered the best and most effective treatment for undescended testicles. There is usually no likelihood of long-term problems following such a procedure. 11\n\nHormonal therapy for undescended testicles is controversial and not widely recommended. It is not generally believed to be very effective, only working in about a fifth of cases. 2",
    "complications": "It is generally considered best to correct cryptorchidism when the affected infant is young. If left uncorrected, cryptorchidism can lead to a higher risk of testicular cancer and can affect fertility. There is also a risk of testicular torsion, testicular trauma and inguinal hernia.\n\nTesticular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35 years. 18 . Globally, the incidence of testicular cancer appears to be rising, but it has good recovery rates. Approximately 11 percent  of all cases of testicular cancer affect men with a history of undescended testicles. Orchidopexy performed as early as possible in life decreases the risk of testicular cancer developing in the affected testis or testes. 2 If undescended testes are discovered in the inguinal ring or in the abdomen only after puberty, they may have to be removed in order to minimize the risk of testicular cancer. One of the major risks accompanying untreated undescended testicles is that testicular cancer may not be detected until it is quite advanced, due to the difficulty of self-examining a testicle if it is not palpable. 11 (For more information on how to check for testicular cancer, see FAQs ) Read more about Testicular Cancer » If you or someone you love is experiencing symptoms about which you are they are concerned, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nMen with a history of cryptorchidism may have lower sperm counts, sperm of poorer quality and lower fertility than men with normally-descended testes. The degree to which men are affected, depends on whether one or both testes were undescended and how long they were undescended before being corrected. While men with unilateral corrected undescended testicles are generally less fertile than men with bilateral normally-descended testes, they have the same rate of paternity, which means that they are equally likely to father children. However, men with a history of bilateral corrected undescended testes have lower fertility and paternity rates than their counterparts with unilateral undescended or bilaterally descended testicles. Men with uncorrected unilateral or bilateral undescended testes are highest at risk of being infertile. Treating the undescended testis at an early age is intended to avoid the risk of low fertility by ensuring that the testis is moved to its optimal environment as early as possible. Testes that remain inside the body are at risk of heat stress, which negatively affects the development of sperm and may cause low sperm count, low sperm quality or low semen quality.\n\nTesticular torsion can occur at any age and is about ten times more common among males with cryptorchidism than it is among those with normally-descended testes. It can occur alongside a testicular tumor, because the weight and size of the tumor can distort the testicle and twist it out of place. It is possible that the greater severity of testicular torsion among undescended testicles results from the fact that detection is often delayed due to the testicle’s location inside the body. 19 Symptoms of testicular torsion differ according to the location of the undescended testis, but can include: Swelling in the groin (inguinal area) Empty scrotal sac on the same side as the swelling Acute abdomen, a condition of severe abdominal pain . Acute abdomen is a medical emergency and medical help must be sought immediately. Read more about Testicular Torsion » If you or someone you care for is experiencing these or any other troubling symptoms, you can start a free symptom assessment at any time using the Ada app .\n\nIf the testis is in the inguinal canal, it is at risk of blunt trauma if the affected person receives a blow in that area. The testis may be compressed against the pubic bone and be injured. 19\n\nDuring the development of the fetus in the womb, the lining of the abdominal cavity extends into the groin. In male fetuses, the testicles and spermatic cords descend through the abdominal lining via a hernia into the inguinal canal and then into the scrotum, after which the abdominal lining closes. In some cases, such as some cases of cryptorchidism, the abdominal lining and hernia do not close properly, and part of the small intestine may move into the inguinal canal. This is usually presents with swelling and pain. The condition requires surgical treatment. 20 21 22 Read more about Inguinal Hernia »",
    "cryptorchidism_faqs": "Q: Will I be able to have children if I have a corrected undescended testicle? A: Yes. If you received treatment early in life, you will have a similar paternity rate as men who had normally-descended testicles. Q: Does having an undescended testicle affect my testosterone levels? A: Yes. It may lead to your testosterone levels being lower than the norm. When this is caused by undescended testicles, it is known as primary hypogonadism. However, if your undescended testis was corrected early in life, your testosterone levels may be normal. 23 Low testosterone can also be caused by injury to the testicle, diabetes, medication, aging or even pituitary tumors. Q: How do I check for testicular cancer?** A: The most common first symptom of testicular cancer is a painless lump on or inside a testicle. Men should routinely check their testicles for lumps, which can be done by rolling their testicles gently between their fingers and noting any changes. If a lump is found, or there is pain that is not the result of applying too much pressure, men should seek medical help.

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cushings-syndrome/",
    "what_is_cushing_s_syndrome": "Cushing’s syndrome is a condition caused by an excess of a steroid hormone called cortisol. This can be caused by taking too much of a medicine which contains cortisol (steroids) or by the body producing too much cortisol. People with Cushing’s syndrome gain weight around their middle and in the face, and develop thin, stretched skin. This condition tends to affect adults between 20 and 50 years of age. The treatment of this condition depends on the cause. Once the underlying cause is recognized and removed, most people with Cushing’s syndrome will recover well. Untreated Cushing’s syndrome can cause osteoporosis, diabetes, high blood pressure and stroke.",
    "risks": "Cushing’s syndrome develops if there is too much cortisol in the body. The most common cause is taking a steroid medication for a long period of time. Cushing’s syndrome can also occur when the body produces too much cortisol. This happens when a growth or cancer causes too much cortisol to be produces. This condition most commonly affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age, and affects three times as many women as men.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptoms include a red, full face (moon face), weight gain around the belly, a hump between the shoulders, skin changes (thinning, stretch marks, easy bruising, increased hair growth) and muscle weakness. Women may become hairier than they previously were. Children may not grow as fast as their peers. Cortisol may affect sexual function and some men may experience erection problems and decreased sexual desire.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is made by evaluating a person's medical history, with special attention to medications, and physical examination where the doctor checks for the typical signs of Cushing’s syndrome. If a medication isn't the cause of the symptoms, saliva, urine and blood tests are done to test cortisol hormone levels, and imaging tests (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) may be done to look for a cause for the excess cortisol.",
    "treatment": "The treatment depends on the cause of the high cortisol level. If it is caused by a high intake of cortisol, the dosage of the medication should be reduced slowly. People taking steroid medications should never stop these medications suddenly. If a growth is the underlying reason, then it may have to be removed by surgery. If it is not safe to remove the cause of the high cortisol levels, cortisol can be blocked by other medications.",
    "prevention": "Taking care to avoid long term use of cortisol-containing medications may help to prevent some cases of Cushing’s syndrome.",

    "what_are_cutaneous_burns": "Cutaneous burns, also known as thermal injuries, are one of the most common household injuries, mostly caused by hot liquids or fire. They can be mild or life-threatening emergencies depending on the percentage of the surface of the body which is burned. Treatment depends on the severity of the injury and possible complications. It varies from minor wound care to treatment in a special burn unit, including medications, wound dressings or surgery. The recovery prognosis after small, superficial burns is usually good. The deeper the burn, the more likely it becomes that scarring will occur. Burns which cover large areas of the body are less likely to recover well.",
    "risks": "A cutaneous burn is damage to the skin caused by heat. Common causes are fire, hot liquids (especially in children), radiation, and ultraviolet light (like sunlight or tanning beds). The severity of burns is classified by how deep the burn is and how much of the body is affected. Cutaneous burns can affect anyone, but tend to affect children and older people more commonly than teenagers and adults. Cutaneous burns are most likely occur by accident, but may also be a sign of abuse.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms and the appearance of a burn both depend on the degree of the burn, which is determined by the depth of the skin affected by the burn. There are three different degrees. First degree, or superficial, burns cause red, swollen and painful skin, which doesn't blister. Second degree burns cause blistering skin and the skin under the blister may be slightly numb. Third degree burns cause the skin to turn black or white, and are usually painless due to nerve damage.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made based on the symptoms and by examining the burned skin.",
    "treatment": "Treatment depends on the degree and the extent of the injuries. First of all, the person should be removed from the source of the heat. Small first or second degree burns may be cooled under running water for a few minutes. People who suffer larger, more serious burns should be treated by emergency services and specialist burn units. Emergency treatment involves giving fluids, keeping the person warm and preventing infections. Once the immediate danger has passed, the affected person may receive skin grafts to help the skin grow back and reduce scarring. Complications, such as infections in wounds, are treated with antibiotics if they occur.",
    "prevention": "The best prevention for burns is to follow safety precautions when handling fire, hot liquids or chemicals. This includes supervising children while cooking, while bathing and at times where they could come into contact with an open flame.",

    "what_is_cyclothymic_disorder": "Cyclothymic disorder, also known as cyclothymia, is a mental health disorder which affects mood. People with the condition experience mood swings between highs and lows that have the potential to interfere with everyday life. Cyclothymic disorder is considered to be a type of bipolar disorder, though the mood swings are not as severe or prolonged as bipolar I or bipolar II disorders. 1 2\n\nCyclothymic disorder affects between 0.4 percent and 1 percent of the population, affecting women more often than men by a ratio of 3:2. 3 4 Cyclothymic disorder usually begins early in life and is manageable with treatment. Less than half of people with the condition will go on to develop bipolar disorder. Some people will experience cyclothymic disorder as a chronic condition which lasts a lifetime, while others will find it goes away over time.",
    "symptoms": "People with cyclothymic disorders experience frequent swings between high and low mood. These swings are extreme enough to be classified as hypomania and depression , though not as extreme as those found in bipolar disorder . The frequency of mood swings in cyclothymic disorder is higher than in bipolar disorder. There may be no periods of stable mood between episodes, and periods of stable mood will last for less than two months. Depressive symptoms will have lasted for at least two years or one year for children and teenagers. High and low moods will be experienced for at least half the time. 6 7 People with cyclothymic disorder tend to have extreme reactions to external events or stimuli. They can be overly happy and enthusiastic in response to a positive event, such as: 8 Success at work A period of good weather Feelings created by substances, like drugs and alcohol They can also be overly pessimistic and depressed by negative events, such as: A relationship setback Onset of winter Stressful situations, such as moving house People experiencing symptoms of cyclothymic disorder should seek professional medical help. In addition, they can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nPeople with cyclothymic disorder can experience hypomania, which is a feeling of exaggerated happiness or wellbeing (euphoria). It is not as extreme as mania. Someone experiencing hypomania may appear to be managing day-to-day activities well, though it can still be disruptive. 8 9 10 Symptoms and signs of hypomania in cyclothymic disorder can also include: Being irritable and agitated Impulsive and risky behaviour Extreme optimism Lack of inhibitions and poor judgement Racing thoughts and talking more than usual Increased sexual drive Easily distracted Overly confident and inflated sense of self-esteem Not sleeping much Excessive physical activity or fidgeting 3\n\nSomeone with cyclothymic disorder will experience depression, which is characterized by low mood. These feelings are more intense and longer-lasting than the feelings of sadness that everyone experiences from time to time. Symptoms and signs of depression in cyclothymic disorder can include: 8 11 12 Low mood for most of the time Feeling hungrier than usual Weight changes Feeling very fatigued and sluggish Sleeping more or less than usual Not enjoying life and activities, even ones normally found pleasurable Feeling upset or tearful Lack of concentration or motivation Feeling guilty or worthless Loss of interest in sexual activity and intimacy Loss of interest in activities and hobbies Being irritable, agitated or tense Being restless Suicidal thoughts and feelings Read more about Signs of Depression »\n\nPeople with cyclothymic disorder have a high tendency towards experiencing depression combined with the high energy of hypomania. This is known as a mixed state or mixed episode. 8 11 Mixed episodes can be difficult to cope with, because the emotional experience is confusing. Someone in a mixed state also poses a greater risk of attempted suicide, as the person may feel the sadness and hopelessness of depression while in an energized state. 6",
    "causes": "It is not known what causes cyclothymic disorder. However, people with the condition often have relatives with bipolar disorder, and there is thought to be a hereditary link.",
    "risk_factors_for_cyclothymic_disorder": "Cyclothymic disorder can develop into bipolar disorder. This is thought to occur in less than half of people with the condition. People with cyclothymic disorder are more likely to misuse substances such as alcohol and illegal drugs, e.g. cocaine. This is caused by reduced impulse control during high moods and heightened reactions to experiences that are perceived as pleasurable. 8 14 The instability of cyclothymic disorder can increase the risk of suicide. This is because of moods shifting relatively rapidly between depression and feeling energized, as well as a tendency towards extreme emotional reactions. 8 15 16 If you have symptoms of cyclothymic disorder you should seek professional medical help. In addition, you can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "diagnosing_cyclothymic_disorder": "Diagnosis will be made by taking a medical history, possibly in discussion with a psychiatrist. Blood and urine tests may be carried out to eliminate physical causes for the mood swings. For example, hyperthyroidism may also cause mood swings. 17 Cyclothymic disorder shares some characteristics with bipolar disorder, but is less intense. This can feel as though the condition is being classified as not serious, when in fact it can have a significant impact on a person’s life. 2 The ICD-10 18 defines cyclothymic disorder as having numerous periods of depression and mild elation, or hypomania, none of which are severe, or extended enough, to be classified as bipolar disorder. DSM-5 criteria 19 defines cyclothymic disorder as having the same mood swings as the ICD-10, but notes that: 8 7 A person should have had many periods of hypomania, and periods of depression for at least two years, or one year in children and teenagers Stable moods should last for less than two months at a time Symptoms do not meet the criteria for bipolar disorder or another mental health condition Symptoms are not caused by another medical condition or by substance misuse Symptoms significantly affect day-to-day life",
    "treatment": "A person with cyclothymic disorder can require treatment even during periods of stable mood. Treatment should be guided by a mental health provider with experience in treating the condition. If necessary, cyclothymic disorder should be treated with psychotherapy combined with appropriate medication.\n\nPsychoeducation is a talking treatment that helps one gain insight into a condition and its effects. 20 Cyclothymic disorder may be a pleasurable experience for some people, and psychoeducation can help bring about acceptance that the condition needs to be treated. 8 Other talking therapies, such as support groups or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), 21 can help someone with cyclothymic disorder manage the condition and prevent it affecting day-to-day life. The duration of psychotherapy sessions will depend on clinical need. 22 Long-term psychotherapy can help by: 6 Instigating healthy daily routines Developing strategies to cope with extreme emotional responses Rebuilding self esteem\n\nWhether to treat cyclothymic disorder with medication, and what kind of medication to use, depends on how difficult the person with the condition finds day-to-day life. Mood stabilizers can work by evening out the high and low mood swings. Commonly prescribed mood stabilizers include valproic acid, lamotrigine and lithium. However, people with cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medication as people with bipolar disorder. 3 Read more about the treatment and management of bipolar disorder » When prescribed on their own for people with cyclothymic disorder, antidepressants can potentially trigger manic episodes or increase the frequency of episodes. If antidepressants are used as a treatment they should be used in conjunction with a mood stabilizer. 8 22 Life-long medication may not be necessary. The goal is to achieve a significant period of stable mood, such as six months to one year. If stability can be maintained through psychotherapy, the person under treatment may be able to stop taking medication. However, this decision should be made in conjunction with a medical professional. 8 22",
    "cyclothymic_disorder_faqs": "Q: Is there a test for cyclothymic disorder? A: There is no test to see if you have cyclothymic disorder. If you think you might have the condition, your doctor will talk to you about your mood history and make an assessment. You may be referred to a psychiatrist if necessary. Q: Can cyclothymic disorder turn into bipolar disorder? A: Some people with cyclothymic disorder will develop bipolar disorder. It’s unclear exactly what determines who will develop bipolar disorder and who will not, but it’s thought that between 15 percent and 50 percent of people with cyclothymic disorder will go on to develop bipolar disorder. Q: Can cyclothymic disorder be cured? A: Some people with cyclothymic disorder will find that symptoms go away with time and treatment. It isn’t clear whose symptoms will disappear and whose will not. Q: Is cyclothymic disorder a personality disorder? A: Cyclothymic disorder is considered a subset of bipolar disorder. People with cyclothymic disorder are often thought of as having a particular type of personality, in that they switch rapidly between highs and lows and have extreme responses to positive and negative events. Someone with cyclothymic disorder may also have a personality disorder, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) . 6"

    "condition": "Cystic Fibrosis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cystic-fibrosis/",
    "what_is_cystic_fibrosis": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic condition which primarily affects the lungs and pancreas, but which can also affect other parts of the body, including the liver, kidneys and intestines. The disease is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene which helps proteins produce and release the body’s secretions, causing these secretions to become thick and sticky. 1 Additional symptoms may include salty skin, digestion problems and poor growth in children. Cystic fibrosis can be detected at birth through routine testing, with symptoms first appearing in early childhood and gradually worsening over time. 2 Treatment options are available to help manage the condition, but, in the majority of cases, life-expectancy is reduced.",
    "symptoms": "The signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis generally begin to occur around 6-8 months after birth, though this can differ significantly from person to person. 1 Symptoms tend to differ depending on age and can affect various areas of the body.\n\nOne of the main areas that the condition affects is the pancreas, a glandular organ located within the gastrointestinal tract, or gut. The pancreas usually produces enzyme-containing digestive secretions, which flow out of the pancreas and into the duodenum to help digest food. Cystic fibrosis can block the flow of these digestive secretions, affecting the way food is digested. This can lead to: 3 Large, fatty and foul-smelling stools Bloating of the abdomen Constipation Malnutrition and poor growth\n\nCystic fibrosis can also cause the lungs to create thicker than normal sputum, or phlegm. As a consequence, bacteria may become trapped in the airways, causing infection and inflammation. If this happens, symptoms may include: 3 A persistent cough, typically accompanied by sputum Wheezing Shortness of breath Recurrent chest infections Newborns with cystic fibrosis may have long-lasting jaundice , as well as meconium ileus, a condition that causes the gut to become clogged with meconium. This is a dark, sticky substance produced shortly before birth, usually excreted as a newborn’s first stool. If the gut becomes clogged with meconium, this may require surgery to relieve. 3 Some people with CF may also develop secondary conditions such as diabetes , osteoporosis , liver problems and male infertility. 2 The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about the how it works .",
    "causes": "Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common inherited disorders. 1 It is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. The CFTR gene controls the way sodium and chloride (salt) ions move in and out of the body’s cells. In people with cystic fibrosis, the gene defect causes too much sodium to enter the cells, which, in turn, causes too much water to enter the cells, leaving too little outside. This leads to secretions from outside the cells to be too thick. 3 The CFTR gene can be affected by over a thousand different defects. The type of defect can affect the level of severity of cystic fibrosis. 4\n\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that to inherit the disorder, a person must receive two faulty genes, one from each parent. People with just one cystic fibrosis gene are known as carriers and usually lead normal lives. They can, however, pass the cystic fibrosis gene onto their children. Cystic fibrosis is far more common in people of white-European descent than in people from any other ethnic group. An estimated 30,000 people are currently living with the disorder in the United States, with approximately 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. 5",
    "diagnosing_cystic_fibrosis": "Cystic fibrosis is diagnosed following various tests. In the United States, 75 percent of people with the condition are diagnosed by the age of 2. 5 Tests to diagnose cystic fibrosis include: 3 4 Newborn screening: All US states and many countries in the world test newborn babies for CF as a matter of routine. This may involve a genetic test to check for a gene defect, and/or a blood test to screen for pancreatic problems. Sweat test: If CF is suspected after initial testing, a sweat test may be used to confirm the diagnosis. This test involves analysing a sweat sample to see how much salt it contains. An abnormally high level may indicate CF. Other tests: If CF is confirmed, other tests may be carried out to check for complications. These may include ultrasound scans, X-rays and a biopsy.",
    "cystic_fibrosis_treatment": "Treating cystic fibrosis typically involves the work of a varied team of CF specialists, nurses, dieticians, respiratory therapists, physical therapists and social workers, among others. This is necessary in order to help treat the many and varied symptoms of the condition. While there is currently no cure, cystic fibrosis can be managed effectively in most cases. The range of possible treatment methods for cystic fibrosis is large and depends upon the symptoms being experienced. The following should be considered a general overview of some of the most commonly used treatment methods, not an exhaustive list.\n\nMost people with cystic fibrosis will experience difficulty properly digesting food. A dietician will outline a detailed nutrition plan, typically high in fats and carbohydrates, to help combat this. Enzyme supplements may also be necessary, normally with each meal.\n\nPhysical therapy, specifically focused on the chest, is often necessary to help clear the airways of sputum. A physical therapist will demonstrate how this is done, so parents and carers can carry out the procedure at home. Typically, the child lies face-down, and a specialist chest-patting technique is applied, encouraging the mucus to be coughed up. Children and adults with cystic fibrosis are also generally encouraged to take part in as much physical activity as possible, such as running or swimming. Antibiotics are also a common aspect of cystic fibrosis treatment. Many people with the condition will take regular long-term courses of the medication, particularly when chest infections develop. If an infection is severe, antibiotic medications taken intravenously may be necessary. 3 Other treatment options for lung-related problems include inhalers, the use of oxygen, which may be necessary overnight in some cases, as well as medications such as dornase alfa, ibuprofen and azithromycin. 3 In severe cases, if the condition fails to respond to treatment, a lung transplant may be required. If successful, this can provide significant relief, but, as all major surgical procedures, it carries a variety of risks. 6",
    "cystic_fibrosis_prevention": "As a genetic condition, there is no way to prevent cystic fibrosis. In many countries, babies are screened shortly after birth to ensure that treatment is begun as early as possible. For people concerned about the possibility of being a cystic fibrosis carrier, genetic counseling and testing are available. Testing can help identify the presence of a faulty gene and counseling can help people to better understand the consequences of testing, as well as the typical pattern of progression of the condition and the treatment options available. 7 To help prevent potentially harmful bacteria being passed on, people who already have cystic fibrosis should avoid spending time with other people with the condition, especially indoors. Bacteria, such as Burkholderia cepacia complex and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pose little risk to people without CF, but can settle in the lungs and cause harm to those who do. Activities such as meeting, sharing rooms and sharing objects should, therefore, be avoided. 8",
    "cystic_fibrosis_prognosis": "Through improved treatment methods and better understanding over the past few decades, the typical life expectancy of a person with cystic fibrosis has drastically improved and roughly 80 percent of children diagnosed with the condition survive into adulthood. 1 Cystic fibrosis, however, remains a serious, life-limiting condition. The prognosis typically differs from person to person, depending on the severity of the condition, the symptoms that are present, as well as the treatment options available. Today, many people with cystic fibrosis live into their late 30s and children diagnosed with the condition today are expected to live into their 40s or 50s. Mortality in childhood or early adulthood, however, is still possible. 1 3",
    "cystic_fibrosis_faqs": "Q: Is there a cure for cystic fibrosis? A: No. Currently, there is no cure for cystic fibrosis. Although treatment methods and life-expectancy have greatly improved over the past few decades, the condition remains a lifelong condition. Q: Is cystic fibrosis dominant or recessive? A: Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that two copies of the faulty gene are required to pass on the condition, one from the mother and one from the father. If only one gene is inherited, that person becomes a carrier. They will typically live normal lives, but will be able to pass on the condition to others. Q: Is cystic fibrosis contagious? A: No, cystic fibrosis is not contagious. It is an inherited condition, meaning it can only be passed on genetically. However, if a person with cystic fibrosis develops a bacterial or viral lung infection, this is contagious to people with or without CF. To prevent passing on the infection, people with a contagious lung infection should take steps to limit their exposure to other people until the condition has resolved."

    "condition": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/cytomegalovirus-infection/",
    "what_is_cytomegalovirus_infection": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a condition that can affect the respiratory tract. Cytomegalovirus is a member of the Herpes virus family and is sometimes also called Human Herpes Virus 5 (HHV-5) . In people who have a healthy immune system (this is called immunocompetence), CMV infection does not usually lead to any symptoms. In some cases, the affected person may be feverish and feel unwell for only a short period of time, or have mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or tender lymph nodes. However, people with weakened immune systems, such as people who are HIV-positive or who are undergoing immunosuppressive treatment because of organ transplants, may become quite ill when infected with cytomegalovirus. Additionally, if a pregnant person is infected with CMV while pregnant, the baby may be affected. This can be particularly serious in newborn babies, as detailed below. The virus can spread through blood, saliva, or sexual contact . It can also spread through mucus from the cervix, the part connecting the womb to the vagina, and breast milk. People who have been affected may continue to shed the virus in their feces, saliva, and urine after infection. 1\n\nGenerally, a cytomegalovirus infection heals on its own within 4-6 weeks, although people with weakened immune systems may need treatment with antiviral drugs to prevent long-term complications. Pregnant women who may have CMV, or mothers of newborns who may have been infected with CMV during pregnancy, should have both themselves and their babies checked for CMV infection, as it can have long-term serious effects on the baby. If the mother tests negative for CMV, though, there is no need to test the baby as well. CMV tests are not a standard part of prenatal care in all countries, and the tests may have to be specially arranged. In cases where a CMV infection is suspected to have happened, the doctor will request a blood test to check for CMV.",
    "effects": "Cytomegalovirus infection is very common . Almost everyone will be infected with cytomegalovirus at some point in their life, usually as a child, though it is possible to contract the virus first time as an adult. It is estimated that between 60 and 90 percent of all adults have had CMV at some time in their lives. 1 It is ordinarily mild and seldom causes symptoms. However, in some cases, the effects of CMV infection can be serious and will need treatment. This is particularly true among people who have weakened immune systems and newborn babies who were infected before birth and show symptoms and who have a low birth weight or were born prematurely. 2 There is some evidence that CMV infection can have long-term health effects in some people who are chronically infected. These include: 3 Atherosclerosis Immunosenescence (premature aging of the immune system) Increased risk of malignancy, such as cancer Increased risk of vascular diseases, such as hypertension and coronary artery disease\n\nThe virus remains in the body after infection and may reactivate in the future if the immune system becomes weakened. People with serious medical conditions, e.g. HIV/AIDS or leukemia, or who take medication which causes the immune system to become weak, e.g. after an organ transplant, are at risk of a recurrence of the virus and may develop severe symptoms.\n\nPregnant women who haven't been infected with CMV before pregnancy are at risk of passing it on to their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. CMV infection is one of the most common congenital (acquired before birth) infections in the developed world and, although most cases are symptomless, it can be quite severe and even fatal if not treated promptly. 4 3 There is also a possibility of complications during pregnancy and, furthermore, there is a possibility of consequences for the baby’s development in the womb. The virus can cross the placenta during pregnancy or delivery, or may be passed on to the baby through breast milk. 4 CMV infection can also occur if the baby receives a blood transfusion from a donor who is CMV-positive.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "CMV infection is usually mild, and most people experience no symptoms . However, in some cases symptoms appear even in healthy people. Symptoms of CMV infection in adults with compromised immune systems can be easily confused with mild presentations of other conditions. Therefore, the infection is often quite serious for people who have weakened immune systems and requires medical treatment.\n\nCMV infection among healthy adults and adolescents is usually spread by person-to-person contact and often causes no symptoms . 1 However, it can sometimes strongly resemble Epstein-Barr mononucleosis. In such cases, symptoms may include: 5 FeverMalaise, tiredness, and a general feeling of unwellnessMuscle and joint pain These symptoms are sometimes confused with Epstein-Barr-virus-related mononucleosis. However, CMV mononucleosis does not cause the sore throat and swollen lymph glands that are characteristic of Epstein-Barr-related mononucleosis. 5 Less often, symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection include: Headache Cough Chest pain Hives or rash Jaundice Neck stiffness Rarely, complications may arise. These include: 1 Hepatitis Pneumonia Meningoencephalitis Pericarditis Myocarditis Thrombocytopenia (blood clotting problems) Hemolytic anemia Ulcers in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract\n\nThe severity of the symptoms of CMV infection experienced by people who are immunocompromised can vary, depending on how suppressed or damaged their immune systems are. 3 The infection causing the symptoms may be a primary infection, i.e., the first CMV infection that person has had or the reactivation of a previous infection. 3 Sometimes, it can also be a combination of the two, as there are various strains of CMV. Immunocompromised people who are particularly vulnerable to CMV include : 1 3 People who are HIV-positive People with leukemia Bone-marrow transplant recipients Kidney-transplant recipients Liver-transplant recipients With the exception of bone marrow transplants, the above transplants are all solid-organ transplants. People who have received hollow-organ transplants, such as lung or intestinal transplants, are at less risk of severe symptoms from CMV infection but may nevertheless be affected. Transplant recipients are vulnerable both before and after they receive the transplanted organ because of the treatment they receive to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ. Symptoms of CMV infection in people who are immunocompromised can include: 1 5 Retinitis , an inflammation of the retina that can lead to vision loss. Gastrointestinal complaints , including gastric, duodenal, and esophageal ulcers, and diarrhea. Pneumonia Problems with the central and peripheral nervous systems . CMV-related retinitis is a risk for HIV-positive people. CMV-related pneumonia and pneumonitis, or inflammation in the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs, are relatively uncommon in HIV-positive people with CMV but do tend to affect transplant recipients and people with leukemia. 5 3\n\nThe symptoms of CMV-related retinitis in people living with HIV and AIDS include: 5 6 Blurred vision Flashes of light Loss of vision in the central field Floaters The affected person usually notices vision loss on one side first, but it will progress to both sides.\n\nSymptoms of CMV-related upset in the upper and lower GI tract include: 1 3 Difficulty swallowing Inflammation of the esophagus Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Jaundice/hepatitis Pancreatitis, i.e. inflammation of the pancreas Colitis; inflammation of the colon Cholecystitis, i.e. inflammation of the gallbladder Ulcers\n\nCMV infection can cause severe symptoms and life-threatening conditions in young babies. Only about one in 10 cases are symptomatic. The most severe form of CMV infection in infants  is known as Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease (CID) or congenital CMV, where the fetus is affected during pregnancy. 7 . The mother may miscarry 4 and in some cases of CID, the affected newborn does not survive despite medical treatment.\n\nSigns that an infant may have acquired congenital CMV infection in the womb include: 4 3 Premature birth Fever Low birth weight Microcephaly, i.e., smaller than average head circumference Inflammation of the lungs Inflammation of the eyes Bruises such as purpura (small purple spots) and petechiae (small red spots) Enlarged, poorly-functioning liver, with jaundice Low blood platelet count Abnormal white blood cell levels (high or low) Enlarged spleen Anemia Children affected by Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease are at high risk of developing complications such as hearing loss and developmental delays, and learning difficulties. 4 7 Hearing loss is the most common consequence of CID, symptomatic or asymptomatic. Seizures and blindness may also occur. ref6 Acquired infection with CMV, which occurs when the baby is infected perinatally at birth or postnatally by breast milk, is less serious and is more likely to be symptomless in otherwise healthy newborns. However, in newborns who are premature or sick with another disorder, it may cause: 7 Fever Swollen lymph glands, Pneumonia Hepatitis Blood clotting problems Hemolytic anemia",
    "how_to_diagnose_cytomegalovirus": "Diagnosis of CMV is usually made by taking a blood or urine sample, which is tested for the presence of CMV-immunoglobulin-M (CMV-IgM) and immunoglobulin-G (CMV-IgG) antibodies, proteins which fight infections, which are created by the immune system after exposure to CMV.  Immunoglobulin-M and immunoglobulin-G levels rise in the presence of CMV infection. 5 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests are the fastest method of determining whether someone has CMV. 5 PCR tests can be done with tissue, urine, saliva or blood. In some cases, viral culture tests can look for the presence of CMV itself in the blood or other bodily fluids.\n\nIn most cases, mothers who contract CMV during pregnancy will be asymptomatic and, as a result, CMV infection of the infant is generally diagnosed in routine ultrasounds during pregnancy. Occasionally, an amniocentesis may be ordered to confirm results. If the baby in the womb seems to be smaller than average, an amniocentesis may be performed in order to get a sample of amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid is then tested for the virus using a PCR or viral culture. If the result is positive, another ultrasound test will be done to determine how affected the fetus is. Good to know: If a pregnant woman develops mononucleosis-like symptoms , they should go to the doctor as soon as possible, as this may be a sign that they have a CMV infection. Doctors can also test pregnant women for CMV antibodies to find out if they have already had CMV infection. 8 In newborn babies, CMV infection is diagnosed by a viral culture or PCR done with urine, saliva or tissue. CMV screening is not currently a standard part of newborn testing in all regions, unless the infant fails the newborn hearing test, but it can be requested. 9",
    "cytomegalovirus_treatment": "People with healthy immune systems generally do not require any treatment for cytomegalovirus infection . However, over-the-counter painkillers may be useful for muscle aches. People with weakened immune systems often need antiviral medications to help fight the virus, reduce the severity of the symptoms, and decrease the likelihood of complications. Treatment of symptomatic cases in immunocompromised people and newborns is usually undertaken with antiviral drugs, including: 5 Ganciclovir Valaciclovir Valganciclovir Foscarnet Cidofovir Ganciclovir implants in the eye may be used to stop the progression of retinitis. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are not usually used to treat CMV in infants due to their toxicity, which can cause liver and kidney damage. 4\n\nInfants with CMV infection are typically treated with ganciclovir or valganciclovir, which can help reduce hearing loss and improve developmental outcomes. Treatment also cuts down on the amount of virus that the baby sheds.\n\nPregnant women with CMV infection may be treated with hyperimmune globulin, which can prevent the virus from being passed on to the fetus. 8 Hyperimmune globulin treatment can also be used prophylactically if the mother does not have CMV infection, but may contract it, for example if they are in regular contact with small children.",
    "how_to_prevent_cytomegalovirus": "There is currently no vaccine for cytomegalovirus. However, taking the following steps may help to prevent infection: Avoiding close contact, kissing or sexual contact with people who are infected Maintaining good hygiene, e.g. washing hands with soap and water Avoiding social situations when sick, as the immune system may be weakened These precautions are especially important for pregnant women. People who work in daycare centres, kindergartens or primary schools are at particular risk of infection and should be careful to maintain good hand hygiene, especially if their duties include changing diapers, potty-training and/or coming into contact with sick or coughing children. 9 This is particularly important for pregnant women who are not immune to CMV or have never had CMV. It is important that people with weakened immune systems are alert to signs of infection and see a doctor as soon as possible if any develop. Signs of infection may include: Fever Malaise Joint pain Coughing Some people, who are scheduled to undergo or have recently received organ transplants, will be put onto a prophylactic course of antivirals to avoid CMV, such as intravenous ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir. 5 Organ donors and recipients alike should be tested for CMV before a transplant occurs. In some cases, transplant recipients may benefit from a reduction in immunosuppressive therapy while their CMV is being treated, to allow their immune systems to combat the CMV, with their viral load closely monitored. 5 There is some evidence that taking oral ganciclovir can have a protective effect against retinitis in HIV-positive people. However, once retinitis has occurred, the vision lost cannot be recovered. People living with HIV should consult their physicians about whether they can take oral ganciclovir, when they should start, and how long they might need to take it for.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/dementia-with-lewy-bodies/",
    "what_is_lewy_body_dementia": "Lewy Body Dementia is a type of dementia characterized by Lewy bodies, clumps of protein that form on brain nerve cells. Lewy Body Dementia is an umbrella term for two types of Dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD). 1 2 Dementia with Lewy Bodies is one of the most common types of progressive dementia. The nerve cells that are affected control thinking, memory and movement. As such, the central features of DLB include progressive cognitive decline, “fluctuations” in alertness and attention, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian symptoms, such as slowness of movement, difficulty walking, or rigidity. DLB most commonly affects the elderly and is rare in people under 65 years old. 3 Parkinson’s Disease Dementia can occur in those with Parkinson’s Disease, although it develops in later stages of the disease, approximately 10-15 years after onset. Not everyone with Parkinson’s Disease gets PDD. Around 30-40% of people with Parkinson’s develop PDD. Risk for developing Parkinson’s Disease Dementia is 6x greater with mild cognitive impairment. 4 Like in DLB, Parkinson’s Disease is caused by the presence of Lewy Bodies, however unlike in DLB, Parkinson’s Dementia starts with movement symptoms and tends to be consistent with a previous diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. Lewy Body Dementia life expectancy varies from on average 5-7 years after diagnosis for DLB and 9 years for PDD. 3 5 Because of their symptoms, people with Lewy Body Dementia may find daily activities difficult and require support. While there is no cure, many people learn to live with their symptoms.",
    "what_causes_lewy_body_dementia": "Lewy Body Dementia is caused by the formation of clumps of proteins called Lewy Bodies inside brain nerve cells. 2 These proteins build up in areas of the brain that control thinking, understanding, memory and muscle movement. It is unclear why Lewy Bodies form and how they cause symptoms, but current understanding suggests they interfere with brain signaling. 3 Lewy Body Dementia main risk factors include being older than 65, having a family history of the disease and being male. 1 6",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Lewy body disease symptoms overlap between DLB and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. Lewy Body Dementia symptoms include difficulties with thinking, memory, judgment, visual perception, language, and reasoning. These symptoms are chronic, tending to get gradually worse with time. How fast symptoms develop is different for each individual. Symptoms can also include: 1 2 3 visual and auditory hallucinations movement disorders e.g. tremors, stiff limbs and slowed movements marked changes in alertness dizziness, fainting, and falls bowel issues and incontinence difficulty swallowing sleeping problems e.g. sleep walking or calling out during sleep depression In Dementia with Lewy Bodies, difficulty with thinking and alertness, and hallucinations may develop in early stages. Issues with memory and movement may develop in later stages. In Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, movement issues develop first and are often in line with a previous diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. 2 Because of these symptoms, further health problems may occur, such as injuries after falling. Daily activities may also get progressively more difficult and people with Lewy Body Dementia may require additional support and care.",
    "diagnosing_lewy_body_dementia": "There is no single test for Lewy Body Dementia. Tests that may be performed include: 1 2 7 assessment of medical history and symptoms physical examination assessment of mental abilities e.g. memory testing blood tests urine tests brain scans Through these, other conditions with similar symptoms can be ruled out and a diagnosis can be made.",
    "how_to_treat_lewy_body_dementia": "While there is currently no cure for Lewy Body Dementia, there are treatments that can help to manage symptoms. 8 A multidisciplinary care team of doctors, nurses, and allied-health professionals can help develop care plans to ease some of the everyday difficulties of living with DLB or PDD. There is no single treatment that is best and as such, treatment is different for each individual. Treatments can include: 9 medicine to help to improve issues with thinking, memory, and confusion medicine to help with movement problems like tremors and stiffness medicine to improve sleep antidepressants to help with depression antipsychotics to help with hallucinations, agitation and aggression psychological therapies and activities to improve memory and problem solving skills physiotherapy to help with movement problems speech therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems occupational therapy to help modify a patient’s environment to make it safer e.g. handrails in the home, removal of fall hazards alternative therapies like massages, music or dance therapy to help with relaxation may be utilized, however further studies are needed to determine its clinical significance. It is to be noted that all medications have side effects, and as such must be monitored. Other considerations that those diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia may wish to consider include making future arrangements for their personal care. This may take the form of ensuring their wishes for care can be upheld if they are ever unable to make decisions for themselves on account of progressive cognitive decline. Support groups also exist that may provide support for people with Lewy Body Dementia, for example The Lewy Body Society and Parkinson’s UK.",
    "dlb_vs_pdd_vs_alzheimer_s": "Lewy bodies can be found in other types of dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia. These diseases have similar processes and many overlapping symptoms. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) shares mental symptoms like confusion and memory loss with Alzheimer’s disease, and motor symptoms such as gait and slow movement with Parkinson’s Disease Dementia. Early memory loss is seen more commonly in Alzheimer’s compared to Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Both conditions can result in problems with movement, but hallucinations, sleep disorders, and dizziness/fainting are more common in early DLB.  Parkinson’s Disease Dementia differs from DLB as movement symptoms start first and are consistent with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease.",
    "dementia_with_lewy_bodies_faqs": "Q: How is Lewy Body Dementia diagnosed? A: There is no single test for Lewy Body Dementia. Tests that may be performed include assessments of symptoms and mental abilities, blood tests and brain scans. Together, a doctor can use these to make a diagnosis and rule out similar conditions. Q: What are the first signs of Dementia with Lewy Bodies? A: In Dementia with Lewy Bodies, difficulty with thinking, alertness, and hallucinations may develop first.

    "condition": "Dengue Fever",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/dengue-fever/",
    "what_is_dengue_fever": "Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection , common in Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean, Africa, the Americas, Australia, and the Pacific islands. Dengue fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito (typically of the species Aedes aegypti) and usually causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, pain in the muscles, and general weakness.\n\nAlthough most cases of dengue fever are relatively mild, even mild infections can cause painful or debilitating symptoms. In rare cases, the condition can turn into severe dengue, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, which can cause acute health problems and be potentially life-threatening. 1 Dengue fever is self-limiting  in the majority of cases, meaning it will be dealt with by the body’s immune system and disappear naturally. There is no specific treatment for cases of mild dengue fever besides supporting the body with rest and plenty of fluids. In severe cases, treatment will be more intensive, with a stay in hospital likely.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms of dengue fever usually begin to develop between four and ten days after infection with the virus. This is known as the febrile stage. Symptoms of this phase include: 2 3 Fever, above 38 C / 100.4 F Severe headaches Body aches, including muscle and joint pain Pain behind the eyes Nausea and vomiting Weakness A widespread red body rash Loss of appetite\n\nThe symptoms of dengue fever can often be confused with flu or another virus. This is especially the case in young adults, who tend to experience a milder form of the symptoms of the infection caused by the  virus. As well as seeing a doctor, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment. The critical stage of dengue fever begins when the initial fever breaks and lasts between 24 and 48 hours. It is known as the critical phase because, although most affected people improve, some people begin to show severe symptoms. This is  also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is most common in children who are younger than 15 years of age and people who have had the infection previously. Symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever include: 2 Severe belly pain Bleeding from any part of the body, most commonly the gums A very high fever Persistent vomiting or vomiting blood Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing A skin rash that is red and blotchy and may result in peeling skin Listlessness and fatigue If the symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever are not well managed, they may lead to severe bleeding and, consequently, shock. This may develop into dengue shock syndrome. This condition can cause death if not promptly and adequately treated. If someone with dengue fever starts to show any of the symptoms listed above, they should seek medical attention again as soon as possible, as proper management of the disease in the next hours is important if complications are to be avoided. 2 There is no treatment other than supportive care. 3 2",
    "what_causes_dengue_fever": "Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes, not from person to person. These mosquitoes are most commonly found in tropical and warm areas and become most active at night or in the early morning. Today, dengue fever is common in many tropical areas of the world. While everyone is at equal risk of being bitten by mosquitoes and contracting the virus, those with weakened immune systems or those who have previously been infected with the virus are most at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever. 4\n\nThe female Aedes aegypti mosquito is the main carrier of the virus that causes dengue fever. The dengue virus is passed on via a bite from one of these mosquitoes, which generally acquire the virus from the blood of an infected individual. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes typically breed indoors in artificial water containers and spend the majority of their lifespan in or around the location where they emerge. They are typically most active in the early morning and the early evening. However, Aedes aegypti are capable of biting and spreading the virus in any location, indoor or outdoor, at any time of the day. Aedes aegypti are the mosquito variety most closely associated with dengue fever. However, other mosquito types have also had dengue fever outbreaks attributed to them. These mosquito types include Aedes albopictus, Aedes polynesiensis, and several species of the Aedes scutellaris complex.",
    "diagnosing_dengue_fever": "People with the symptoms of dengue fever should seek a medical opinion as quickly as possible. Dengue fever is diagnosed with a series of blood tests used to identify the virus itself, the immune reaction to the infection, and other effects the infection may have on the body, such as reduced blood clotting. 3\n\nDengue fever, chikungunya fever, yellow fever and Zika virus are all spread by the same two species of mosquito - Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The viruses that cause dengue, Zika and yellow fever are members of the family Flaviviridae; the virus that causes chikungunya fever belongs to the family Alphaviridae. 6 It can sometimes be difficult to tell these various mosquito-borne diseases apart from the symptoms alone, which are similar. However, all of these disorders can be diagnosed using blood tests. The symptoms of chikungunya include: Fever Severe joint pain Muscle pain Headache Joint swelling A rash The joint pain associated with chikungunya is very severe. The disease can relapse; people who have been infected with the chikungunya virus can sometimes have pain in the joints in the months following the acute phase of the illness. The symptoms of yellow fever include: 8 Fever Chills Malaise Headache Nausea and vomiting, sometimes vomiting blood Weakness Dizziness Lower back pain More serious symptoms such as jaundice, decreased urination, redness of the eyes and face, heart arrhythmia and bleeding may also occur. 9 Most people with Zika virus infection do not show symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they are usually mild and may include: 10 Fever A rash Conjunctivitis Malaise Headache Muscle and joint pain",
    "what_is_the_best_treatment_for_dengue_fever": "If dengue fever is suspected, medical attention should be sought immediately. Doctors will generally prescribe rest and plenty of fluids to help support the body in combating the infection. There is currently no effective vaccine or specific medication to treat dengue fever. Pain relievers containing acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, can be used to manage some of the symptoms, mainly body pain and headache. People with dengue fever should take care to consume enough fluids to remain well-hydrated. People with a fever can be cooled down using a wet towel or sponge.",
    "how_to_prevent_dengue_fever": "As there is no specific treatment, prevention is key to combating dengue fever. If living or traveling in tropical areas, taking steps to avoid the reproduction of mosquitoes and avoid being bitten by mosquitoes is the most effective method of doing this. Reducing the mosquito population by identifying and removing locations where they can breed should be the first step in dengue fever prevention. These locations include birdbaths, buckets, old tires and flower pots, or anywhere where standing water can collect. Other effective ways to protect yourself against mosquitoes include: Insect repellents. To be used even when indoors and applied directly to the skin as well as to clothing. Parents should be aware that children may need repellent that has been specially approved for use on children. Loose and protective clothing. Mosquitos are able to bite through tight clothing, so garments should be loose and cover as much of the body as possible. Light colours are also preferable to dark. A mosquito net. When sleeping, a mosquito net is vital for everyone, especially children. If possible, the net should be treated with insecticide.\n\n20 countries globally have licensed a dengue fever vaccine named CYD-TDV. The vaccine does not offer total protection against dengue fever, and its efficacy may differ according to age and previous exposure to the viruses that cause dengue fever. 11",
    "dengue_fever_and_hemorrhagic_fever_prognosis": "Generally, dengue fever is a self-limiting infection that naturally passes within two weeks of infection. People who develop dengue hemorrhagic fever have a higher risk of life-threatening complications. 12",
    "advice_for_travelers": "People traveling to regions where dengue fever is a risk, including Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Caribbean, Africa, the Americas, Australia and the Pacific islands should be sure to think about prevention before they arrive. Travelers should ensure they pack: A supply of insect repellent Loose, protective clothing Their own mosquito net to reduce the risk of being bitten. After arriving, efforts should be made to avoid locations where mosquitoes breed, such as stagnant water, and travelers should take special care during times of the day when mosquitoes are most active. Generally, this is at night, dusk , and dawn. 3\n\nDengue fever is a spreading global concern. Before the 1970s, dengue fever was found in only nine countries, but the disease is now found in over one hundred countries worldwide, most of them in the tropics or subtropics.\n\nIn Asia and the Middle East, affected areas include: India Pakistan Bangladesh China Sri Lanka Yemen Saudi Arabia In South East Asia, countries that have reported cases of dengue include: 2 Thailand Cambodia Laos Vietnam Myanmar The Philippines In Central America, South America, and the Caribbean,the  regions affected include: 2 Costa Rica Cuba Haiti Aruba Colombia Venezuela Honduras Nicaragua Panama Ecuador Peru Bolivia Paraguay Argentina Chile Brazil Mexico Many islands in the Caribbean In North America, countries that have reported cases of dengue include: 2 The United States of America, predominantly the warmer southern regions No cases have been reported in Canada. In the Pacific, regions affected include: 2 Fiji Tonga Vanuatu French Polynesia Malaysia Indonesia, including Bali The Cook Islands The Solomon Islands Australia, predominantly the tropical regions No cases have been reported in New Zealand. In North Africa, regions affected include: 13 14 Egypt Sudan Eritrea Ethiopia In East and Central Africa, affected regions include: Djibouti Sudan Kenya Tanzania and Zanzibar Uganda Rwanda Zambia Democratic Republic of the Congo In Southern Africa, regions affected include: Mozambique Madagascar The Comoros The Seychelles Mauritius and Reunion South Africa Namibia In West Africa, regions affected include: Gabon Equatorial Guinea Cameroon Nigeria Cape Verde Togo Benin Ghana Mali Burkina Faso Cote d’Ivoire Senegal\n\nThere is as yet limited information on the effects of dengue fever during pregnancy , although it is a very common cause of fever in pregnant women in areas in which the disease is endemic. There is some evidence that having dengue fever during pregnancy slightly increases the risk of excessive bleeding after giving birth known as postpartum hemorrhage, preterm birth and low birthweight. 15",
    "dengue_fever_faqs": "Q: Is dengue fever contagious? A: No. Dengue fever is not spread from person to person but via infected mosquitoes. 16 Q: Can dengue fever be fatal? A: Yes. However, this is rare. Dengue fever with complications, and especially dengue hemorrhagic fever, can be fatal if they are not treated. Q: Can dengue fever come back after you recover? A: No. Dengue fever is not recurrent in the same way that, for example, malaria is. However, it is possible to have dengue fever more than once. A person who has had dengue fever caused by a particular strain of dengue virus may thereafter be immune to that strain but may still be prone to infection by one of the other strains. 3 Q: What virus causes dengue fever? A: Dengue fever is caused by four closely related viruses, known as serotypes: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. DEN-5 may also be responsible for a few dengue infections. Although each of these serotypes interacts with the body in a different way, each virus causes the same symptoms to manifest. It is possible to be immune to one serotype while still being prone to infection by one or more of the other serotypes. 3 Q: What is the difference between dengue fever and malaria? A: Both dengue fever and malaria are spread by mosquitoes, but the diseases themselves are not related. Dengue is spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, while malaria is spread by the Anopheles mosquito. Dengue fever is caused by the DEN virus, of which there are four or possibly five strains known to infect humans. Malaria, however, is not caused by a virus but by single-celled parasitic organisms of the genus Plasmodium; these are neither bacteria nor viruses. Malaria is recurrent: someone who has been infected once may experience several bouts of symptoms throughout their lives without being re-infected. Dengue fever on the other hand is not recurrent. If someone who has had dengue before shows the symptoms again after they recovery, it means that they have a new infection. Both dengue and malaria can be cured. Read more about Malaria » Q: Is dengue fever connected to Zika virus? A: The Zika virus and dengue virus belong to the same family of viruses, Flaviviridae. The viruses that cause yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile fever are in the same family. These viruses are spread by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Q: Is dengue fever connected to chikungunya fever? A: The Chikungunya virus and the dengue virus themselves are not related. However, the virus that causes chikungunya fever, known as CHIKV, can be carried by some of the same species of mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The same species of mosquitoes may also carry Zika virus, and the areas where each disease is endemic do somewhat overlap. Q: Can dengue fever be sexually transmitted? A: Dengue fever cannot be sexually transmitted between humans. Mosquitoes, however, can transmit the virus to other mosquitoes during mating. 17 Dengue fever cannot be spread from person to person. Q: What does the dengue fever rash look like? A: Typically, it begins as a mild, red, blotchy rash, giving the infected person a flushed appearance. As the virus develops, the rash can become more severe, turning bright red and developing lesions. 3 Q: When should I visit the doctor if I think I have dengue fever? A: If there is any suspicion of dengue fever, you should visit a doctor immediately. A doctor will be able to evaluate your symptoms and make a proper diagnosis. If you have been diagnosed with dengue fever and the symptoms don’t go away or worsen in three days, a doctor should be seen once again to reduce the risk of complications. As well as seeing a doctor, the free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment. Q: Which liquids should I drink? A: People with dengue fever are encouraged to drink plenty of water, fruit juice, or oral rehydration solutions to maintain electrolyte concentrations. There is some emerging evidence that staying well-hydrated can help to prevent hospitalization, although it is still very important that someone with dengue fever seek professional medical advice. 18 Q: What medicine can I take during dengue fever? A: Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, can be used to manage the body pain and headaches that typically come with dengue fever. Anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen and aspirin must  be avoided as they may cause complications. 19 Q: Where is chikungunya fever found? A: Areas currently affected by Chikungunya include: 6 the USA Central and South America the Caribbean Asia South East Asia Indonesia Malaysia the West Pacific Islands Saudi Arabia Yemen The Indian Ocean Islands East Africa Central Africa West Africa Southeast Africa Canada, Korea, Japan, Botswana, Namibia, Australia, and New Zealand are not affected."

    "condition": "Dental Abscess",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/dental-abscess/",
    "what_is_a_dental_abscess": "An abscess is a pocket of pus that forms within body tissues. 1 Abscesses are the result of an infection, generally bacterial, localized in the area where the abscess forms. They are almost always accompanied by swelling and inflammation. Dental abscesses are abscesses affecting the teeth and adjacent jaw tissue.\n\nEach tooth is made up of several layers. The outermost layer is the enamel, which covers a softer layer, the dentin. The dentin and enamel are the tooth’s protective layers. Underneath the dentin is the pulp, where the tooth’s nerves and blood vessels are situated. The pulp runs down the center of the root of the tooth, which connects the tooth to the underlying bone of the upper or lower jaw. Infections in the pulp can therefore easily spread into the bone of the jaw. Likewise, if the gum around the tooth becomes infected, the tooth is at risk of damage as well. Some abscesses affect the pulp first and spread to the bone, while others affect the surrounding tissues of the gum and do not start in the pulp. In abscesses, the presence of plaque 2 and gingivitis 3 are likely to make the situation worse. Antibiotics are sometimes necessary to control the infection. 4 If treated correctly, dental abscesses are not life-threatening. Treatment of dental abscesses is usually carried out by dentists and often involves taking an antibiotic and root canal treatment. In rare cases, however, the infection can spread, and the condition may become very severe and possibly life-threatening in extremely rare cases. 5 Treatment for dental abscesses involves draining the pus from the tooth and filling or removing the tooth to prevent re-infection. There are two major subtypes of dental abscess: periapical and periodontal.\n\nPeriapical abscesses usually occur near the tip of the root of the tooth. They are more common among children than among adults. Children with poor dental hygiene are particularly at risk of periapical abscesses. 5 Poor dental hygiene, including inadequate brushing or flossing, can cause caries, also known as cavities, which erode the enamel and dentin, admitting bacteria to the pulp. As a result of this, the pulp becomes inflamed, and this can lead to the death of nerves in the tooth. Because dead tissue is more vulnerable to infection, this puts the tooth at high risk of an abscess. 1 In periapical abscesses, damage to the enamel and dentin, as in the case of later-stage cavities admits bacteria to the pulp, leading to an inflammatory condition known as pulpitis. Periapical abscesses are a common complication of severe, long-term pulpitis. 6 They can cause swelling in the jaw, cheeks, and the floor of the mouth. 2\n\nPeriodontal abscesses are more common among adults than children and are often a complication of gum disease. 1 They tend to originate in the alveolar bone 7 and periodontium. 8 Gum disease or injury can cause teeth to become loose and/or inflamed, including the surrounding area. The resulting pocket that forms between the tissue and the tooth is vulnerable to infection by bacteria which can then form a periodontal abscess. ref1",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Dental abscesses are usually painful. The pain may be situated in the tooth itself, the surrounding gum or be more generalized, including the jaw, cheeks, or even neck or face, depending on the location of the abscess. 1 The affected tooth may: 5 6 Feel tender Feel loose in the jaw Be sensitive to heat and/or cold in the mouth Be sensitive to pressure on the tooth, or to being tapped Be slightly raised People with a dental abscess may experience pain in the affected area. If you are concerned that you may have a dental abscess, you can do a free symptom check with the Ada app or find out more about how it works . Other symptoms of dental abscesses include: 1 5 Swelling in the gums or face Redness of the skin over the affected part of the gum Bleeding in the gums Swollen lymph glands in the neck Generally feeling unwell (malaise) Loss of appetite or inability to eat Fever Dental examination may also reveal swelling and redness around the tooth in the mouth and a fluctuant (movable/shiftable) mass in the area. 9 Periodontal abscesses may also present with a gum boil. A gum boil, also known as a parulis, is a soft red papule that appears where a sinus or channel from an abscess reaches the outside of the gum, between the gum and the inside of the cheek. It is the result of an abscess, so it is a definite sign that an abscess is present, but it is not itself an abscess. Rarely, in severe cases of dental abscess, the affected person may also experience: 5 Cellulitis, is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues Lockjaw (trismus) Difficulty swallowing, due to pain and swelling Difficulty breathing, due to swelling Difficulty speaking Dehydration Generally, a spreading dental infection as a result of an abscess may cause the affected person to feel very unwell. They may have a fever (a body temperature of 38 C / 100.4 F or higher), swelling in the floor of the mouth, the face, or the jaw, and severe pain that does not respond to maximum doses of over-the-counter painkillers such as. If any of these symptoms occur, the affected person should seek emergency dental care from a dentist or, if no dental care is available, visit a hospital emergency department or see another doctor as soon as possible. While doctors are not trained to handle dental procedures, they will be able to assist with antibiotics and painkillers to control the infection and pain until dental care is accessed.",
    "causes": "Dental abscesses are the result of bacterial infection. When the gum tissue surrounding a tooth becomes damaged or the tooth itself is damaged, bacteria that are already in the mouth and, under usual circumstances not harmful, may enter the area and cause infection. One of the most common causes of damage to the teeth and gums is poor dental hygiene, such as inadequate brushing and flossing, high sugar or carbohydrate consumption, and lack of regular checkups at the dentist. These factors may lead to dental caries or cavities, gingivitis, and periodontitis, which can admit bacteria to the inside of the tooth or the gum. 10 Maintaining healthy teeth and gums is therefore one of the best ways of reducing the risk of developing dental abscesses, as it removes one of the main causes of abscesses.",
    "diagnosing_dental_abscesses": "If a dental abscess is suspected, the affected person should visit the dentist as soon as possible. The dentist will perform an examination of the affected area. They may test the affected tooth by pressing on it or tapping it with an instrument. 6 If the tooth is infected, it will usually be very sensitive to pressure or tapping (percussion), and may often be painful. Further, if the abscess is periapical, the swelling at the root will push the tooth upwards in its socket, and it will feel higher than the surrounding teeth. While laboratory testing is not usually needed to establish whether or not an abscess is present, dentists will usually do an X-ray of the affected tooth and the mouth as a whole to establish the exact location and the size of the abscess. 5 The abscess may be aspirated 11 and the pus cultured to determine which strains of bacteria are involved. This helps to guide antibiotic therapy if it is needed. 5",
    "treatment": "The usual treatment for a dental abscess is to drain pus as soon as it is possible to do so. This will be done surgically, either by a dentist or a maxillofacial surgeon, a surgeon that has trained as a dentist as well as a doctor and handles complex jaw, tooth, and mouth conditions. 5 They may make an incision in the gum or drill a hole in the tooth to allow the pus to drain. 1 Once the pus has drained away, the area will be cleaned. In periapical abscesses, all dead pulpal tissue will be removed to prevent infection from recurring. 1 In periodontal abscesses, very deep cleaning of the teeth and specifically the gum and roots will be done. A root canal may also be necessary if the whole tooth is compromised. If the decay is severe, the tooth may be removed.\n\nRoot canal treatment is the standard treatment for the removal of pulpal tissue in cases where the tooth will be retained and not extracted, and it may also be an option in cases where pain is ongoing even after the abscess is resolved. 12 The person undergoing a root canal will be given a local anesthetic injection to numb the parts of the jaw and mouth affected by the abscess. During the procedure, the dead or infected pulp is removed, the inside of the pulp canals are smoothed, and the pulp is replaced with a filling, often gutta-percha. 13 In a few months time, an X-ray and dental checkup will be done to check that the site is healing properly.\n\nAs abscesses are painful, people may need acetaminophen or to control the pain. Essential oil of cloves has topical anesthetic properties and can be applied to painful areas, although it is very important to maintain strict hygiene while doing this. Home remedies like the above-mentioned oil may provide some pain relief, but will not cure an abscess or prevent further infection. In uncomplicated abscesses, antibiotics may not be necessary. If the infection is severe or has spread, or if the abscess cannot be drained, antibiotics will be prescribed to help bring the infection under control. Antibiotics commonly prescribed for dental abscesses include: 5 Penicillin Amoxicillin, alone or in combination with clavulanate Azithromycin Metronidazole Cefoxitin If the patient is allergic to amoxicillin and/or penicillin, clindamycin may be prescribed. Penicillin is the usual antibiotic used to treat mild or moderate infections. Because antibiotics alone don’t always penetrate the abscess very well, the abscess may also be surgically drained. 5 Most dental abscesses are straightforward to treat and resolve completely after they are drained.\n\nAlthough the essential oil of cloves can be used to manage the pain and sensitivity associated with dental abscesses, it will not cure the abscess. Abscesses will not go away on their own and cannot be treated at home. Untreated abscesses can develop secondary infections and other serious complications that are extremely hazardous to health (see below). It is possible for an untreated abscess to become a medical emergency requiring urgent care from a doctor or dentist. It may also lead to jaw bone loss. Only a qualified medical or dental professional is properly equipped to administer treatment for an abscess safely and effectively. It is strongly advised that people affected by abscesses, or who suspect they may have a dental abscess, seek out the advice of a dentist as soon as they can. It is not safe to try to drain an abscess at home or to leave an abscess untreated.\n\nIdeally, a person affected by a dental abscess, or who suspects that they may have a dental abscess, should visit the dentist as soon as possible. Because it is not always possible to see a dentist in time, some people may need to be treated for their abscesses in a hospital emergency department. Medical doctors are not specifically trained to handle dental issues but will be able to stabilize the affected person, providing antibiotics and pain relief, until they can see the dentist.\n\nIf a person with an abscess or a suspected abscess shows any of the signs listed below, they should seek urgent medical care as soon as possible. 14 15 16 Danger signs for tooth abscesses include: An abscess of more than 1cm in diameter, or which feels large Severe swelling or hard lumps on the gums or the face Bleeding on the gums or in the mouth Fever or a body temperature of more than 38 C / 101.4 F Tender lymph nodes in the neck area If a person shows the symptoms listed below, they should immediately be seen by a hospital emergency department: 17 18 Severe pain that cannot be controlled with painkillers Shortness of breath or other difficulty breathing Difficulty swallowing due to swelling, or difficulty taking in liquids leading to dehydration Severe difficulty opening the mouth Swelling of the neck or around the eyes, or severe swelling of the face in general Secretions in the mouth they can’t handle due to difficulty swallowing, opening the mouth, or others",
    "complications": "In rare cases, complications do arise. These can include: 1 5 19 Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Ludwig’s angina occurs when cellulitis spreads into the tissues under the tongue, in the lower jaw, and under the chin. It is also known as submandibular cellulitis/submandibular space infection. Osteomyelitis is an infection of the underlying bone. Parapharyngeal abscess is an abscess at the back of the mouth, near the throat. It is caused by staphylococcal and/or streptococcal bacteria. It is most common in children aged five years or younger. Cavernous sinus thrombosis can occur when the infection spreads into the blood vessels in the sinuses of the head. Sepsis These conditions require very urgent medical attention and are best evaluated via a hospital emergency department. 17 18\n\nCellulitis is an infection of the skin. Facial cellulitis,  for example, can be caused by infections of the upper respiratory tract, middle ear infections, or tooth abscesses. Although these conditions can increase the risk of facial cellulitis, they do not directly cause it; the condition results when an infection spreads to the skin. Symptoms of facial cellulitis include: 20 Swollen, red skin on the face, especially the cheek Itching and burning of the affected skin A painful, possibly swollen, tongue Fever If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have cellulitis or a tooth abscess, you can start a free symptom assessment right now using the Ada app .\n\nParapharyngeal abscesses and Ludwig’s angina can both cause swelling severe enough to obstruct the airways and cause difficulty breathing. Parapharyngeal abscesses require a needle aspiration to diagnose. Ludwig’s angina is diagnosed by, needle aspiration and X-rays. Treatment for Ludwig’s angina, parapharyngeal abscess, osteomyelitis, cellulitis, and cavernous sinus thrombosis involves drainage of any pus that is present, possibly via surgery and antibiotics and possibly intravenous antibiotics. People affected by Ludwig’s angina, if untreated, may require a tracheostomy to open their airways and thereby help them breathe if the swelling obstructs the windpipe.\n\nA spreading untreated infection from a dental abscess can cause pain around the eyes, ear pain, nose pain, and swelling in the eyes or face. Severe dental infections can spread to other parts of the body, causing potentially serious medical conditions such as bacterial meningitis and infective endocarditis . An untreated dental abscess or one that does not respond to treatment can very rarely cause sepsis, which is potentially life-threatening. Read more about Sepsis »",
    "dental_abscess_faqs": "Q: Can a dental abscess be dangerous? A: Dental abscesses, especially if they are properly treated, typically do not cause severe or long-term problems. However, if it is left untreated or if improperly treated, a severe dental abscess can potentially cause complications, possibly even serious ones. Q: Are dental abscesses contagious? A: No, they are not. Dental abscesses cannot be spread from one person to another. Q: How can dental abscesses be prevented? A: As dental abscesses are most often the result of dental caries or gum disease admitting bacteria to the vulnerable pulp of the tooth or into a gum pocket, the first line of prevention is preventing caries and gum disease. This involves maintaining good dental hygiene, including: Regular, twice-daily brushing Regular, daily flossing and use of mouthwash Eating a healthy diet with limited sugar, particularly limiting or avoiding sugary drinks Avoiding smoking Q: Are there any factors which predispose people to dental abscesses? A: Some medications, such as anticholinergics, protease inhibitors, SSRI antidepressants, and SNRI antidepressants can cause xerostomia, meaning dry mouth. 21 22 Dry mouth results from a decrease in the amount of saliva, which causes the amount of bacteria in the mouth to increase and can therefore worsen tooth decay. This can be prevented by taking especially good care of proper dental hygiene, drinking plenty of water, and possibly talking to a doctor for further treatment options for the xerostomia itself. People who are immunocompromised may be at higher risk of dental abscesses because their immune systems cannot always adequately handle bacterial invasions. People at risk include: 1 People who are HIV positive or have AIDS People who are undergoing chemotherapy People who have sickle cell anemia People who use steroids People who have had a splenectomy People taking immunosuppressive medication after transplantation People with severe autoimmune diseases, taking immunosuppressive medication It is recommended that most people have a dental checkup at least once a year. Children and people who are at risk, or who have a history of dental problems, should go more often, at least twice per year. If a dental abscess is suspected, dental help should be sought immediately. Q: What foods are safe to eat and drink after treatment for a dental abscess? A: Many people find it best to eat soft, bland foods after treatment for a dental abscess, as there may be some mouth pain. 23 Foods such as milkshakes, bananas, applesauce, yogurt, cooked cereals, scrambled eggs, mashed potato, and custard or soft pudding may be suitable. It is important to ensure that the affected person stays well-hydrated. Q: What is pericoronitis? A: Pericoronitis is a condition involving infection in the gum that covers an unerupted tooth, the operculum. It is particularly associated with wisdom teeth, especially impacted wisdom teeth. Sometimes the gum above the unerupted tooth breaks, and bacteria lodge in the damaged tissue, causing infection. 24 Acute cases of pericoronitis can have symptoms such as pain in the jaw and pain when the affected person opens their mouth, as well as swelling and fever. Bad breath may also be a symptom. Abscesses can also occur. Chronic pericoronitis may present with mild inflammation that comes and goes. 25 Pericoronitis will require the treatment and care of a dentist. Pericoronitis can be treated with warm salt-water rinses and antibiotics such as metronidazole,  phenoxymethylpenicillin, or erythromycin. 26 Q: Can dental abscesses affect wisdom teeth? A: Wisdom teeth, also known as third molars, usually erupt into the mouth in late adolescence. Occasionally, due to the position of the other teeth in the mouth, there is not enough space for them and as a result, impaction may occur. Impaction can occur at any age and means that the teeth cannot erupt properly and get stuck completely or partly below the surface of the gum. Although this does not always cause problems, 27 it can cause pericoronitis, an inflammation (see above), which may then develop into an abscess. 28 Q: Can a dental abscess cause swelling but no pain? A: Yes. However, this is a cause for concern: if an abscessed tooth that has been painful initially stops being painful, it generally means that the affected tooth has died. Pain may also lessen considerably if the abscess ruptures and drains. It does not mean that the abscess is gone, however. 29 Infection can still spread and become very serious even if the tooth is not painful, and the affected person should see a dentist as soon as they can. Q: Are all dental abscesses visible? A: No. Those dental abscesses that develop a fistula or a gum-boil are visible, but it is possible for there to be no visible sign that an abscess has formed. If someone is experiencing mouth pain and/or any of the symptoms listed above, they should see a dentist to determine what is causing the pain, even if they cannot see anything obviously wrong in the mouth. Q: Can a dental abscess be hard? A: While most abscesses are usually soft and warm to the touch, occasionally they can feel firm or even hard to the touch. 30 Anyone with a suspected abscess, jaw swelling, jaw pain, or tooth pain who feels a hard lump in the mouth should see a dentist as soon as possible. Q: Can dental abscesses develop next to or underneath a crown, dentures, dental implant, or dental bridge? A: Yes. Dental work such as crowns or implants can cause dental abscesses, but only if they are improperly done, damaged, or broken. Crowns are often used to help preserve a tooth after a root canal has been done, meaning that they are attached to a tooth that is already compromised. 31 Although it is rare for abscesses to affect crowns, it is possible. Dentures can cause injury to the gums beneath them if they do not fit properly; 32 an injured gum is vulnerable to infection. It is important to make sure that dentures fit properly, and it is necessary to replace any denture that does not fit properly to reduce the risk of infection, injury and poor dental hygiene. Dental implants are used to replace missing teeth and are not natural teeth. They are a little more susceptible to mechanical stress and therefore to colonization by bacteria that may lead to abscesses. However, most dental implants are successful. 33 Dental bridges do not have roots and cannot themselves become abscessed, but it is possible for one of the supporting teeth on either side of the bridged tooth to become abscessed. Q: Can trauma or an injury to the mouth cause a dental abscess? A: Yes. A trauma like a blow to a tooth, or, over the longer term, increased wear and tear, such as might result from chronically grinding or clenching teeth, can damage structures of the tooth and therefore increase the risk of a dental abscess developing by bacteria having easier access to this tooth’s sensitive areas. 34 Q: Can dental abscesses appear under the tongue? A: An abscess under the tongue is not a dental abscess, but it could possibly be the result of a dental abscess that has led to Ludwig’s angina, a form of cellulitis that affects the tissue below the tongue, below the lower jaw, and the floor of the mouth. Ludwig’s angina is a medical emergency, and the affected person should seek medical help in a hospital without delay."

    "condition": "Depression in Childhood or Adolescence",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/depression-in-childhood-or-adolescence/",
    "what_is_depression_in_childhood_or_adolescence": "Childhood and adolescent depression is an emotional disorder which affects people under the age of 18. Like depression in adults, it is characterized by persistent feelings of low self-esteem, sadness, and hopelessness and can last for weeks or months. It is more common in the teenage years. Signs of depression in children and adolescents include irritability, loss of interest and social isolation. These signs may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as sleeping difficulties, digestive problems, changes in appetite, and fatigue. Successful treatment typically involves psychological counseling and medication. With treatment and support, many people recover from depression. Untreated depression in children and teenagers may have lifelong consequences.",
    "risks": "Depression can affect children and young people of any age, including infants. This condition becomes more common with age and by adolescence, and many as 1 in 5 young people may have symptoms of depression. In childhood, boys are more commonly affected than girls, but during puberty, more girls are often affected than boys. The causes of depression are not clear, but it is probable that several factors combine to cause depression. These include stressful life events, a lack of social support, changes in brain chemicals and unstable family or social circumstances. Children who have a close family member with depression are more likely to also develop depression. Some children with ongoing medical issues are more likely develop depression. Infants born to women who experienced depression during pregnancy are more likely to show signs of depression.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of depression vary with age. Small children may express depression by uncontrollable crying or reluctance to eat or play. They may develop slower than other children and seem less interactive than other children. School-aged children appear impulsive, easily frustrated and sometimes have social and learning difficulties. They may develop self-harming behavior. Symptoms in teenagers can sometimes be difficult to recognize, but include a persistently low mood, and a lack of energy and motivation. They may experience or describe feelings of inner emptiness, insecurity, and trouble concentrating. Teenagers also experience physical symptoms, such as difficulty sleeping, stomach pain, a loss of appetite, weight loss or gain and headaches. Their school performance may gradually get worse. Less commonly, some teenagers may develop thoughts of death or suicide.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually made by an experienced child psychologist or psychiatrist based on the symptoms described by the young person. The doctor should rule out other possible causes for the symptoms. Some blood tests can be helpful to rule out these other causes. Keeping a diary which documents the patient’s mood, sleep, energy and thoughts might be helpful in making the diagnosis.",
    "treatment": "The treatment of depression in children and teenagers is guided by the severity of the symptoms and the circumstances of the child and their family. Treatment commonly involves psychotherapy (counseling) and sometimes medication. Counseling often involves the family, and is typically focussed on helping a young person learn to recognize and control their thoughts and feelings, and on teaching them healthy coping skills. Treatment is slow and steady, and it may take weeks to months until improvement is seen.",
    "prevention": "A reliable source of emotional support may help to prevent young people developing depression. Exercise, enough sleep and a healthy diet are also very important. Early recognition, diagnosis and treatment are all factors which can reduce the chance of depression in chilhood becoming a lifelong condition.",

    "condition": "Depressive Episode",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/depressive-episode/",
    "what_is_a_depressive_episode": "The definition of a depressive episode is a period of depression that persists for at least two weeks . 1 During a depressive episode, a person will typically experience low or depressed mood and/or loss of interest in most activities, as well as a number of other symptoms of depression, such as tiredness, changes in appetite, feelings of worthlessness, and recurrent thoughts of death. The length of a depressive episode varies, but the average duration is thought to be six to eight months. 2\n\nDepression is a common illness, and many people will experience one or more episodes of depression in their lifetime . While people of all races and ages can experience depressive episodes, they tend to be more common among women than men. 3 4 People who have a history of depression, other mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder or anxiety , or chronic physical conditions such as diabetes , chronic pain or multiple sclerosis 5 , also have a higher risk of experiencing a depressive episode. 2 The severity of a depressive episode varies; it may be classified as major or minor, depending on the number of symptoms and degree of impairment (social, domestic, and work) experienced. Regardless of the severity, all depressive episodes should be taken seriously and treated promptly by a professional healthcare provider. Effective treatment, which typically involves medication and/or therapy, for depression is available. 4 Without appropriate treatment, the risk of experiencing further episodes of depression is thought to be higher. The risk of another depressive episode occurring seems to increase with every new episode, with each one likely to last longer and be more severe than the previous one. Timely treatment can alleviate the symptoms of depression and help shorten the duration of any future episodes. 6",
    "depressive_episode_symptoms": "The symptoms of a depressive episode typically include a depressed mood, i.e. feeling sad, empty, or hopeless, and/or loss of interest or enjoyment in most activities, together with any number of the following: 1 7 Feeling worthless or excessively guilty Fatigue or lethargy Difficulty with concentration, memory, and decision-making Insomnia is not being able to sleep through the night, waking up early, or sleeping too much Appetite changes Unexplained weight loss or gain Unexplained physical ailments that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive problems, or pain Sluggishness, restlessness, agitation, or irritability Thoughts of death or suicide, sometimes with suicide plans or suicide attempts These symptoms are usually present every day or almost every day, for at least two weeks. 1 Signs of depression may differ according to sex and age. There are also various types of depression and depressive disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder (previously known as manic depression), postpartum depression and dysthymia, among others. 8 If a person seems to be in imminent danger of harming themselves, an emergency support provider should be contacted immediately.",
    "causes": "The causes of depressive episodes are complex and varied, involving social, psychological and biological factors. Depression may occur as an isolated episode or as part of a chronic depressive condition. 4 While the exact causes are not yet fully understood, the following may increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing a depressive episode: 2 3 ref7 9 10 History of depressive episodes Bipolar disorder Anxiety Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Other mental health conditions Family history of depression Changes in the functioning of the brain History of sleep problems Chronic pain Heart disease, cancer and other chronic health conditions Stressful life events such as losing one’s job, losing a loved one (bereavement) or psychological trauma Lack of personal support structures Drug and alcohol abuse Childhood trauma People who have recently had a baby may experience postpartum depression . 11 Sometimes, there is no obvious cause for the occurence of a depressive episode. 10 Some health conditions, such as hypothyroidism , can cause symptoms of depression. 3 While uncommon, adverse reactions to certain medications can also cause depressed mood. 2 However, treating these underlying causes and disorders should alleviate the symptoms.",
    "diagnosis": "After taking the affected person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor or the mental health specialist to which the person is referred to, can diagnose a depressive episode based on the criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). A major depressive episode (MDE) is characterized by five or more of the following symptoms being present every day, or almost every day, for a minimum of two weeks: 1 Depressed mood for most of the day Loss of interest or enjoyment in all or most activities Significant unexplained weight loss or gain, or appetite changes Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much (hypersomnia) Restlessness or sluggishness Tiredness or lack of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions Thoughts of death or suicide – there may be suicide plans or suicide attempts These symptoms should indicate a marked difference from the affected person’s previous functioning. For the diagnosis to be made, at least one of the symptoms needs to be depressed mood or loss of interest in most activities. It is also necessary for the symptoms to cause significant distress or impairment in social and job functioning. 1 If the symptoms are attributed to another mental health condition, the diagnosis and treatment may be different to that detailed here for a depressive episode. 1 To rule out any other health conditions that could be causing symptoms of a depressive state, such as a thyroid disorder , a doctor may order blood tests or scans. If a person is considered to be at risk of dementia, the doctor will also check for this condition, as some of the symptoms can be similar to depression. 2\n\nIf only two to four of the above symptoms are present, instead of a major depressive episode, a diagnosis of a minor depressive episode may be made. At least one of the symptoms needs to be a depressed mood or loss of interest in most activities. This may occur as part of a minor depressive disorder.",
    "depressive_episode_treatment": "Depression is considered to be a treatable condition, with treatment often involving a combination of medication and therapy. Sometimes complementary remedies and lifestyle changes may also be suggested. The treatment program will be tailored according to the severity of the depressive episode, as well as the affected person’s medical history and personal preferences. 2 3 11\n\nPsychotherapy is talk therapy, and there are several different types that may be effective for people experiencing a mild or moderate depressive episode. These include counseling, problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, group therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) – which can help a person develop more helpful ways of thinking and acting. 10 12 For some people, a combination of psychotherapy and medication may be more effective than psychotherapy alone for depression. 12\n\nMedication may be prescribed in cases of moderate or severe depression, often in combination with a course of psychotherapy. 2 While the way it works is not yet fully understood, antidepressant medication may alter the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain with a positive impact on mood. 10 12 Several different types of antidepressants are available. The main categories include: 12 13 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Typically the first line of treatment, 2 SSRIs tend to cause fewer side-effects than other antidepressants. Examples of SSRIs include fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Similar to SSRIs, but may work better for some people. Examples include venlafaxine and duloxetine. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): An older type of medication that may cause more side effects. Generally only prescribed if other treatments do not work, or for other mental health conditions. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline and imipramine. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): A type of antidepressant usually prescribed when other treatments have not worked or have caused intolerable side effects, as well as in cases of atypical depression, which has different characteristics to other types of depression. Examples include phenelzine and isocarboxazid. Because MAOIs can interact with certain foods and medications, special care must be taken with this antidepressant. 14 There are also a few other types of antidepressants, such as bupropion and mirtazapine. It may take a few weeks for an antidepressant to take effect and alleviate the symptoms of a depressive episode. A doctor will advise on how long the medication should be taken and what to do if a person wishes to stop taking it. While antidepressants are not considered to be addictive, stopping them suddenly may cause discontinuation symptoms, so the process needs to be managed by a medical practitioner. 12 Some people may experience side effects while taking antidepressants, including: 12 Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Diarrhea or constipation Feeling sleepy Sexual problems While less common, other side-effects may include serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition where high levels of serotonin cause mental and physical symptoms like anxiety, rapid heartbeat, high temperature and vomiting, 15 and suicidal thoughts. 12 It may be necessary for a person to try several different medications before finding one that they feel works for them. 12 The type of antidepressants prescribed will depend on the affected person’s age, health, and medical history. A doctor will arrange check-ups a couple of weeks after treatment is started and regularly thereafter to monitor progress. 2\n\nExercise: Physical activity may be recommended to help with mild to moderate depression, though it is not entirely clear how effective exercise is. 2 3 St John’s Wort: This herbal medicine is sometimes recommended for depressive episodes. However, its efficacy has not been conclusively proven, and it may interact with prescription medications. Before taking St John’s Wort, it is advisable to consult a doctor even if taking no other medications, but especially if taking other prescription or over-the-counter medication. 10 12 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): In this treatment, an electrical current is used to stimulate the brain. ECT is typically reserved for depression that is particularly severe or has not responded to other treatments. 10 Light therapy: Bright light therapy has been shown to improve depressive symptoms, both as part of seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and non-seasonal major depressive disorder. Light therapy may be helpful on its own or in combination with psychotherapy or antidepressant medication. 16 Acupuncture, spiritual practice, and nutritional changes may also be suggested as complementary therapies to help in the treatment of depressive episodes, though there is insufficient scientific evidence to support their efficacy. 3 If the depressive episode is mild, a doctor may suggest waiting for two weeks to see if it clears on its own. In addition, they may recommend self-help resources, relaxation therapies, and a small number of psychotherapy sessions. Antidepressants are not usually prescribed for mild depression unless they persist or cause complications. 2 11 In severe cases of depression, where a person is at risk of harming themselves or others or is experiencing psychotic symptoms, they may be referred to a specialist care facility. 2 If a person seems in imminent danger of harming themselves, an emergency support provider should be contacted immediately.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip/",
    "what_is_developmental_dysplasia": "Developmental dysplasia of the hip, or simply hip dysplasia, is a failure for the normal hip joint to form before birth. It may be caused by poor positioning of the legs in the womb. This doesn't cause any pain to young children, but can cause a limp and osteoarthritis as the child grows. Hip dysplasia can be successfully treated, especially if diagnosed and treated in babies or young children.",
    "risks": "In a normal hip, the upper end of the thigh bone (femur) is surrounded by the hip socket (acetabulum). In a dysplastic hip, there is an abnormality in the formation of either the head of the femur, the acetabulum, or the other supportive soft tissues. As a result, the contact between the femur and the acetabulum is loose and unstable, causing frequent hip dislocations . Hip dysplasia is more common in girls and people with who have family members with the condition. Within certain ethnic groups this condition tends to be more common, such as Native Americans and Laplanders. Other risk factors include being the first-born child or a breech baby.",
    "symptoms": "Babies will usually have no symptoms of hip dysplasia, though it might be possible to see a difference in the length or appearance of their legs, hips and buttocks. Toddlers with hip dysplasia may walk later than other children, and children with hip dysplasia who have not been diagnosed may suffer hip pain and walk with a waddle, limp or bowed legs.",
    "diagnosis": "All babies should be tested for hip dysplasia in the first weeks of their life. This is usually done by a doctor assessing the movement of the hips, or, increasingly, by ultrasound. X-rays of the hip joint can help to determine hip dysplasia in cases where there is uncertainty.",
    "treatment": "Hip dysplasia is treated by placing the baby in a harness or brace for a period of a few months to keep the legs in the correct position to allow the hips to form normally. If this is not successful or the developmental dysplasia of the hip is diagnosed later in life, surgery is necessary to reconstruct the hip joint.",

    "what_is_diabetes_insipidus": "Diabetes insipidus is a hormonal condition that interferes with the water balance in the body. This condition occurs when the hormone anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) does not act strongly enough on the kidneys, causing them to pass more water than what is necessary. This condition causes people to feel more thirsty than usual and to produce large volumes of diluted urine. This condition can affect people of all ages. The outlook is usually good, although it can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. People concerned that they may be experiencing symptoms of diabetes insipidus can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "risks": "Diabetes insipidus is a condition that interferes with the water balance in the body. A hormone called ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) is responsible for helping the kidneys to maintain water levels. If there is not enough ADH or in the kidneys don't respond to ADH in the blood, more water will be lost as urine. Damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (the parts of the brain responsible for making ADH) or the kidneys can cause this condition. Some medications can make the kidneys less responsive to ADH. Pregnancy can also cause this condition, though this is not very common. Some people develop this condition without any obvious cause.

This condition happens due to the body not responding well to the hormone insulin, which causes high blood sugar levels. Knowing your risk for this condition and recognizing the symptoms of diabetes type 2 can help you get to a diagnosis early on. With the appropriate treatment, your risk of complications decreases notably.",
    "what_is_diabetes_type_2": "Diabetes type 2 , also known as type 2 Diabetes Mellitus , is a common condition in which the body’s cells do not respond well to the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas to make sugar in the blood accessible to the body for energy. If you have diabetes type 2, then you have a problem bringing sugar into the cells. This causes the sugar to stay in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels. 1",
    "what_is_the_difference_between_type_1_and_type_2_diabetes": "The biggest difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes lies in their causes and mechanisms. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to insufficient insulin production. In contrast, type 2 diabetes is primarily acquired through lifestyle and diet, although genetics can also contribute. It occurs when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces, a condition known as insulin resistance. These differences in causes result in distinct mechanisms for high blood sugar levels: in type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin, whereas in type 2 diabetes, insulin is produced but not used efficiently. Notably, type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases. 2 3",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Some early signs of type 2 diabetes may include: 4 A dry mouth and increased feelings of thirst Feeling very tired Peeing more than usual Losing weight Slow healing of wounds Blurred vision Pain or numbness in the feet or hands Itching or thrush around your genitalia Dry skin Frequent infections Type 2 diabetes does not always cause symptoms or can cause very mild symptoms, often only being diagnosed when complications have arisen. This is why you should visit your healthcare provider early on if you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 3",
    "what_causes_type_2_diabetes": "Type 2 diabetes is caused by problems with a hormone in the body called insulin . This hormone is produced by the pancreas , an organ that is situated behind the stomach and that is connected to the bowel. It produces substances necessary for digestion and produces hormones such as insulin and glucagon which regulate the body’s sugar levels. Insulin is of high importance to the body because it makes sugar in the blood available for use by the body as energy. Diabetes type 2 happens when the body no longer responds to insulin of the pancreas and the cells no longer take up sugar, leading to an elevated amount of sugar in your bloodstream . 1",
    "risk_factors_for_diabetes_type_2": "Some people have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes . You’re especially more vulnerable if: 5 You are over 40 years old You have a family member with diabetes You are overweight and do not exercise often You are from an Asian or African background If you recognize some of these type 2 diabetes risk factors, then it is important to get routinely checked for diabetes, as there may not always be warning signs in the early stages of the condition.\n\nIt's essential to keep your diabetes well managed, as people with poorly managed underlying health issues such as diabetes mellitus that get COVID-19 can experience severe symptoms, possibly leading to hospitalization and even death.

    "how_to_diagnose_type_2_diabetes": "The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is often based on the symptoms and testing the amount of sugar in the blood . If your bloodwork does not show any increase in your blood sugar levels, and you are at risk of diabetes without any symptoms, then a repeat test is often done. A glucose tolerance test can also be done, during which a measured amount of glucose is given, and the levels of sugar in the blood are measured over a period of time. This allows for clinicians to see if the body is taking up the glucose as expected. 6 2",

The first steps of treatment involve lifestyle changes, such as increasing physical exercise, improving your diet, and maintaining a healthy weight. Type 2 diabetes medications are necessary in most cases. These medications help keep your blood sugar levels within the normal range. Your healthcare provider may prescribe you with metformin or other medicines that help keep your blood sugar at a healthy level. Over time, you may need to inject insulin with an injection pen if other medication no longer works. Throughout your treatment for type 2 diabetes, it’s important to have regular check-ups in order to detect and prevent consequences, such as eye and nerve damage. Specialist diabetic educators are also helpful in providing information and support at all stages of treatment. 7",

    "what_is_diabetes": "Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a condition in which the body’s blood glucose, or blood sugar, is too high. Glucose comes from the food we eat and is the body’s main source of energy. It is helped to reach the cells of the body by insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas. Diabetes occurs when the body produces no or insufficient quantities of insulin to do this, and so glucose builds up in the blood. 1 Read more about diabetes in Ada’s dedicated diabetes guide . Persistently high blood glucose levels can, over time, cause health problems such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure and vision loss. 2 With proper treatment, however, diabetes can generally be managed effectively and complications minimised. Treatment will usually be required throughout a person’s life as, currently, there exists no cure for diabetes.",
    "types": "There are a number of types of diabetes, though type 1 and type 2 are the most common. Of these, type 2 diabetes is by far the most common, accounting for approximately 90 percent of all cases of diabetes in Europe and North America. 3\n\nType 1 diabetes typically develops in children and young people, though it can affect people of any age. It occurs when the body ceases to produce insulin and blood glucose levels become very high. This results from the body’s immune system mistakenly attacking the healthy cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin. 4 The underlying cause of type 1 diabetes is not fully understood. Although not classed as a hereditary disorder, a person is more likely to develop type 1 diabetes if a close relative, such as a parent or a sibling, has the condition. The symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically come on quickly, over a number of days or weeks, and include thirstiness, tiredness and a need to urinate frequently. Treatment generally involves the use of insulin injections. 5 With proper management, type 1 diabetes can usually be controlled effectively.\n\nType 2 diabetes typically affects people over the age of 40, though it is becoming increasingly common in those of a younger age. This type of diabetes occurs when the body ceases to produce sufficient amounts of insulin, or when the body does not use insulin properly (something known as insulin resistance). It may also be caused by a combination of the two. 6 Type 2 diabetes is often linked to being overweight or obese. The disorder also tends to run in families and is more common in people of Caribbean, African or South Asian descent. Symptoms typically develop slowly, over a number of months or years, and include thirstiness, tiredness and a need to urinate frequently. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet and regular exercise, however in some cases medication may also be required to manage blood sugar levels. 6 Read more about Type 2 Diabetes »\n\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes are by far the most common forms of the disorder. However, other types do also exist and include the following: Gestational diabetes is diabetes that occurs for the first time during pregnancy. People with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery, and the need for a cesarean section, though with proper management these risks can be significantly reduced. 7 Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare, hereditary form of diabetes caused by a mutation of a single gene. In many cases, the signs and symptoms of MODY are mild and the condition may go unnoticed, only to be identified through routine testing or testing for another condition. 8 Neonatal diabetes is a very rare form of diabetes, typically diagnosed in children under six months of age. The condition is caused by a gene mutation. 9 Type 3 diabetes is a proposed alternative name for Alzheimer’s disease, as, in some cases, Alzheimer’s can be linked to insulin resistance. 10 While technically not a form of diabetes, pre-diabetes , or impaired glucose intolerance, should also be noted. This condition occurs when blood glucose levels are high, but not high enough to qualify as diabetes, despite giving a similar risk of heart disease, stroke and other complications normally associated with diabetes. Pre-diabetes is typically managed through lifestyle changes such as losing weight or switching to a healthier diet. 11",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes typically include: 12 Excessive thirst A need to urinate frequently Excessive hunger Fatigue or tiredness Blurred vision Wounds that are slow to heal Unexplained weight loss Tingling and/or pain in the extremities The symptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop quickly, over a number of days or weeks, while the symptoms of type 2 diabetes typically develop more gradually, normally over months or years. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be hard to detect at first and may sometimes be confused with normal signs of aging.",
    "causes": "Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are caused by an insufficiency of insulin. However, what causes this insufficiency differs in each case. Type 1 diabetes is, in most cases, an autoimmune disorder. This means that the immune system, which usually attacks unwanted germs and bacteria, mistakenly attacks healthy cells. In the case of type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. What triggers the immune system to do this is not known, though a popular theory suggests that it may be triggered by a virus. There is also a genetic element to type 1 diabetes. Although it is not a hereditary disorder, if a first-degree relative – a parent or sibling, for example – has the condition, a person stands a greater chance of developing it themselves. In rare cases, type 1 diabetes can also be caused by severe inflammation of the pancreas or the surgical removal of the pancreas. 4 13 Type 2 diabetes is generally caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors. Lifestyle factors include being overweight or obese; eating a diet high in carbohydrates, sugars and fats; and physical inactivity. The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes also increases significantly if a first-degree relative has experienced the condition. 3",
    "diabetes_complications": "With appropriate treatment, many people with diabetes are able to prevent possible complications of the condition occurring. However, if treatment is not received, or if it is ineffective, a variety of complications can occur. These complications can be serious and possibly life-threatening. Complications of diabetes include: 14 Cardiovascular disease: Diabetes increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems including stroke , heart attack and atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries). Nerve damage: Nerve damage can cause pain, tingling and numbness, especially in the extremities. Left untreated, this can lead to a total loss of feeling in the affected limbs. Kidney damage: Damage to the kidneys can, in extreme cases, cause kidney failure and may lead to the need for dialysis or a kidney transplant. Read about the Signs of Kindey Problems » Eye damage: Diabetes can, in extreme cases, lead to blindness and other vision problems such as cataracts and glaucoma. Foot damage: Poor blood flow to the extremities and nerve damage can cause various complications. Wounds, for example, can be slow to heal, and this may be particularly problematic when the feet are affected. Serious infections may result, and, in severe cases, amputation may be required. Hypoglycemia: Insulin taken to treat diabetes can, in some cases, cause blood sugar levels to fall too low. This is called hypoglycaemia, and initial symptoms may include feeling shaky, dizzy, tired or irritable. Mild hypoglycemia can typically be treated by oneself, whereas severe cases may require medical attention. People who suspect that they may be experiencing a complication of diabetes should speak to a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",

Read more about the link between COVID-19 and diabetes here .",
    "diagnosing_diabetes": "Diagnosing diabetes will typically involve an evaluation of the symptoms being experienced and a variety of diagnostic tests. These tests may include: 15 16 Random blood glucose test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test: A reading of 126mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes. HbA1c test : A reading of 6.5 or above will generally indicate diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance test: A reading of 200mg/dL or above will generally indicate diabetes. Tests to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, such as a urine ketone test or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies tests, may also be necessary. Whichever test is used, it will usually be repeated several times to allow doctors to gain an accurate picture of a person’s blood glucose levels. People displaying symptoms of diabetes should be tested. Moreover, people over the age of 40 should also consider testing, even if they are displaying no symptoms. This is especially true for people within the at-risk groups for type 2 diabetes – people who are overweight or of African, Caribbean or South Asian descent, for example. 15",
    "diabetes_treatment": "There is no cure for diabetes, meaning treatment is aimed at managing blood glucose levels and controlling the symptoms and possible complications of the condition. In the majority of cases, diabetes can be successfully managed. People with type 1 diabetes will usually require regular insulin treatment in order to keep their insulin levels normal. This will typically involve insulin injections , which will be required around two to four times a day. Although some people may use a syringe, in most cases, what is known as an insulin pen or auto-injector will be used. A full explanation of how to administer the insulin will be given upon diagnosis with the condition. Family members or friends may also be taught how to properly do this. 17 The blood glucose levels of people with type 1 diabetes will also need to be regularly checked. This can be done with a home monitoring kit, and can help to determine daily insulin needs. The levels will also be reviewed by doctors to ensure that the overall treatment plan is working effectively. 17 Lifestyle changes are the main method of treatment for type 2 diabetes. This will typically involve: 4 18 Dietary changes: Eating a healthy, balanced diet is key to controlling type 2 diabetes. A dietician will be able to provide guidelines on what to eat, though generally a diet low in fat and high in fibre, fruits and vegetables is recommended. Exercising: Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five times per week is generally advised for people with type 2 diabetes. Losing weight: If a person with type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, losing weight can be helpful in reducing blood glucose levels. Dietary changes and exercise can help with this. In many cases, lifestyle changes alone are enough to reduce blood glucose to the target level, leading to remission. However, some people may also require medication. Medications that may be prescribed include metformin, sulfonylurea medicines, nateglinide and repaglinide. 4",
    "diabetes_prevention": "Only type 2 diabetes is preventable. This is because this type of diabetes is commonly caused or exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyle choices. Adopting a healthy, balanced diet is the most important factor in helping to prevent type 2 diabetes. This should be a diet low in carbohydrates, sugar and fat, and high in fruits, vegetables and grains. 19 Other ways to help prevent type 2 diabetes include: 19 Maintaining a healthy weight Exercising regularly Not smoking Minimising alcohol intake"

    "what_is_diaper_rash": "Diaper rash is a common skin condition characterized by redness and irritation in the area covered by a diaper. This includes: The genital area The buttocks The lower back The abdomen The inner thighs. Most often found in babies, it is also known as: 1 Nappy rash Diaper dermatitis Irritant diaper dermatitis. Diaper rash is a type of inflammation most often caused by wetness, skin sensitivity, or chafing, though it can also be caused by certain medications or chemicals. While uncomfortable, it is usually a mild condition that can be successfully treated at home. If you think your little one might have nappy rash, try using our free symptom assessment with the Ada app.",
    "prevalence": "One of the more common conditions among infants, diaper rash affects as many as one in three babies at any given time, 2 with boys and girls being equally susceptible. It ranges from mild to moderate to severe irritation. Mild diaper rash: Manifests as a faint pinkness that is limited to a small area and does not usually cause distress to the infant. Moderate to severe diaper rash: Tends to be brighter red and more widespread, and it may feature noticeable swelling, blisters and ulcerated areas. The resultant pain can cause significant distress. This type of nappy rash should be checked for signs of infection. 1 3 4 Parents and caregivers can prevent diaper rash by changing their baby’s diapers often and promptly, especially when there is stool present. It is recommended that they cleanse the skin gently but thoroughly, making sure the area under the diaper is dry, and apply barrier creams when necessary. Many parents feel ashamed when their child develops diaper rash, because they believe they have been neglectful somehow. However, even the most careful parents have to deal with it. Almost every baby will experience the condition at least once. Provided that the rash is treated properly, it usually disappears within a few days and does not have any long-term health effects.",
    "symptoms": "It is important to determine whether the skin irritation is mild or severe. Usually, it is fairly easy to make this distinction. One of the first signs of diaper rash is redness in the area that is usually covered by the diaper. In mild cases, this can be a faint pinkness. Other symptoms include the following:\n\nThe following symptoms are typical of mild diaper rash: Pink or red patches A few scattered pimples Slight scaling and dryness Stinging sensation when passing urine or feces\n\nThe following symptoms are typical of severe diaper rash: Extensive redness Soreness in the area Pimples Ulceration Blisters Dry, cracked skin Infant is visibly distressed In all cases, the skin may feel warm and puffy to the touch. If treated as soon as symptoms become apparent, the rash should clear up quickly and with minimal fuss. Mild cases of diaper rash can usually be treated at home. If the rash is severe, or symptoms persist or worsen, it is important to seek medical help. Do any of the symptoms above sound familiar? Try an asessment on the Ada app .",
    "causes_for_nappy_rash": "There are many different possible causes of diaper rash and sometimes there is more than one irritant to blame at one time. The following are the most likely causes: 5 Prolonged exposure to urine and feces: The wetness and ammonia can irritate the skin Friction (chafing): The diaper may rub against the skin, causing irritation. This often happens when the diaper is too tight or, in older babies, when grains of sand or crumbs get under the diaper while they are playing or eating Sensitive skin: Conditions such as eczema and seborrheic dermatitis may increase the risk of a baby developing diaper rash. However, these conditions are usually not limited to the diaper area Intolerance to a product: The skin may react to one of the ingredients in a new product, such as baby wipes, lotions, soaps, different brands of disposable diapers, and detergents and softeners used on cloth diapers. New foods in the diet: Diaper rash often develops when a baby starts eating solid foods. The content and frequency of their stools can change, causing skin irritation. Breast-fed infants can also develop diaper rash in reaction to something their mother has eaten. Yeast or bacterial infection: The warmth and moisture of the diaper area make it susceptible to bacteria and yeast (candida) infections. The creases of the skin are particularly vulnerable and may become red, with scattered red dots nearby. Antibiotics: By killing good bacteria along with the bad, antibiotics, whether taken by an infant or their breastfeeding mother, can upset the balance of the skin flora. Yeast infections can develop as a result. Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, which irritates the skin. If the diaper rash does not go away despite resolution of the suspected causes, a doctor’s opinion should be sought to: Identify the triggers Treat the rash Prevent it from recurring or worsening.",
    "diagnosis": "Doctors usually diagnose diaper rashes by taking a history and conducting a physical examination. Unless they suspect an allergy or rare deficiency, they are unlikely to perform laboratory tests. 6 A medical practitioner will be able to differentiate diaper rash from other skin conditions such as eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, and advise on the best course of action. In the case of mild diaper rash, a home diagnosis is usually made by caregivers, based on the symptoms presented by the infant.",
    "treating_nappy_rash": "Mild cases of diaper rash can be treated at home, without a visit to the doctor or special medications. Taking simple steps to improve the infant’s skin care will usually clear the rash.\n\nLeave the diaper off for as long as possible. This will allow the area to air-dry and aid healing. You can lay the infant on an absorbent towel if necessary. The following steps can also be taken: Changing diapers frequently, including at night. Cleaning the skin with warm water, using a gentle, fragrance-free soap if necessary. Avoid wipes, as these can be irritating. Take care not to rub too hard, and always wipe the genital area from front to back. After cleaning, pat the skin dry with a soft cloth or allow it to air-dry. Bathing the infant no more than twice a day to stop the skin drying out. Avoiding baby powders as they can aggravate the inflammation. Gently applying a barrier cream or ointment after diaper changes. This will reduce the contact between skin and waste products, helping to prevent further irritation. Zinc cream, zinc oxide and petroleum jelly are all options. Natural alternatives, such as creams containing marigold extract, are available too. A pharmacist will be able to advise on which product to use. 2 Ensuring that the diaper is not too tight. Trying a different brand of diaper to see if it might help. Using fragrance-free, hypoallergenic detergents and softeners when washing cloth diapers and baby clothing. Introducing new foods slowly to see whether there is a connection. 7 If a food item seems to be problematic, removing it from the baby’s diet for a few days and reintroducing it slowly, checking for a reaction.\n\nIf the rash is severe, persists or worsens despite the above interventions, it is advisable to consult a pharmacist or doctor. If there are any signs of pus, bleeding or fever, medical care should be sought immediately. A doctor may prescribe a special treatment for the rash. This could include: A mild hydrocortisone (steroid) cream An antifungal ointment Topical or oral antibiotics (in the case of bacterial infections). Hydrocortisone creams should only be used if deemed necessary by a doctor, as they can cause additional problems. 8 If the rash does not respond to any of these treatments, the doctor may refer the infant to a specialist to get to the bottom of the problem.",
    "prevention": "Diaper rash can often be prevented by practicing what is known as good diaper care. This involves keeping three keywords in mind: 9 Clean Dry Apply And taking the following steps: 1 10 Changing diapers as soon after soiling as possible to reduce skin exposure to urine and feces. Cleaning the diaper area thoroughly with warm water alone, using a gentle, fragrance-free soap only where absolutely necessary. Use soft cloths or cotton balls and wipe gently. If you are using baby wipes, make sure they are mild and alcohol-free. Drying the skin by patting it with a clean towel, or allow the diaper area to air-dry. Avoid talcum powder, cornstarch and other drying powders, as these can cause skin irritation. Applying a barrier ointment regularly to protect the skin. Checking that the diaper is not too tight. Washing the hands with soap after changing the diaper to prevent the spread of germs. Set aside periods where the diaper can be left off for a while. When the infant starts taking a course of antibiotics, pre-empt diaper rash by applying barrier creams.",
    "faqs": "Q: Can adults get diaper rash? A: Yes, diaper rash can affect adults too. Anyone who wears diapers or incontinence briefs can develop diaper rash, regardless of their age. They may notice the following around the genitals: Pain Swelling Redness The causes and treatments of diaper rash in adults are similar to those in infants. It is important to check that the diapers or briefs fit well to minimize friction, and ensure that they are changed often so that moisture is not left to accumulate. The genital area must be cleaned and dried properly at each change. To avoid causing further irritation, warm water and a fragrance-free, alcohol free cleanser should be used. A mild repair cream can provide relief. Hydrocortisone and antibiotic ointments should not be applied unless prescribed by a doctor. Patients can also increase their fluid intake to dilute their urine, making it less irritating to the skin. The affected adult should seek medical advice if there are any signs of infection, such as: Blisters Pus Fever The rash spreading to other parts of the body The rash not going away in three to four days. Persistent or frequent diaper rash in adults may be a sign of neglect or abuse. 11 Q: Can you use diaper rash cream for acne? A: Some people claim to have used diaper rash cream to treat their facial pimples and acne, touting the protective properties of zinc oxide for the skin. However, medical practitioners do not recommend using dedicated diaper rash creams for anything other than the treatment of diaper rash. Off-label use, particularly of products containing hydrocortisone, could cause contact dermatitis and actually worsen acne. 12 It is advisable to consult a dermatologist about appropriate treatments for acne. Read more about treating acne » Q: Is diaper rash related to teething in babies? A: In the past, diaper rash was often thought to be related to teething in babies. Many caregivers believed that teething could lead to loose stools and result in diaper rash. However, modern studies have found that teething is not typically a cause of diaper rash. 13 If your child is showing symptoms of diaper rash, the condition should be treated as outlined above.",

    "what_is_disseminated_tuberculosis": "Disseminated tuberculosis, also known as widespread tuberculosis, is a contagious infection in which a tuberculosis infection has spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, with multiple organs affected. Disseminated tuberculosis can occur within weeks of infection with tuberculosis or years afterwards. The diagnosis of this form of TB involves taking a sample from the organ, that is believed to be affected, to prove the presence of an infection. The treatment of disseminated tuberculosis usually involves taking a combination of antibiotics for 6 to 12 months. Most people recover well, although it does take time for the symptoms to improve. People who may be experiencing symptoms linked to disseminated tuberculosis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment. Good to know: The term miliary TB is used by some interchangeably with disseminated TB. However, miliary TB in fact refers more specifically to disseminated TB which presents with a millet-seed-like appearance on a chest x-ray, when the disease is spread by blood throughout the lungs (see FAQs ). 1",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms depend upon the organ system infected with the bacteria. Common general symptoms of tuberculosis include: 2 Fever Chills Night sweats Malaise, i.e. feeling generally unwell Joint pain Weight loss Fatigue Pale skin due to anemia Swollen glands A cough and shortness of breath Skin rashes Less common symptoms that may be related to disseminated tuberculosis include: 3 Bone pain Diarrhea Abdominal pain Swelling Blood in the urine Rigors People who may be experiencing symptoms linked to disseminated tuberculosis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Tuberculosis (TB) is very infectious. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is spread through the air and via droplets from the mouth or throat of person infected with the pathogen. Infectious patients cough up large numbers of mycobacteria, which can survive on objects outside of the body for a long time. 2 Tuberculosis is usually contained in the lung by the formation of small granulomas, a mass of tissue that forms in response to infection or inflammation. These are structures created by the body to contain the mycobacterium. In such a case, the condition is known as primary or pulmonary tuberculosis. Occasionally, normally in people with a severely damaged i e system, granuloma formation is impaired, and mycobacteria can spread through the blood or lymph system ref4 and infect other parts of the body. When this occurs, it is called disseminated tuberculosis. Common locations for this to occur include: 3 Central nervous system Liver Spleen Kidneys Adrenal glands Choroid, a structure within the eye Skin",
    "risk_factors_for_disseminated_tuberculosis": "Risk factors for catching primary TB include: 5 Being around people who have the condition Living in crowded or unclean conditions Having poor nutrition Most people with tuberculosis in the US will not develop disseminated tuberculosis, as the immune system is often able to contain the primary infection. Risk factors that may increase the risk of developing disseminated tuberculosis may include: 6 Living in areas where there is not good access to health care Not being well nourished Living in crowded conditions Having a weakened immune system, especially among people with HIV Being older than 65 or an infant",

    "disseminated_tubercilosis_diagnosis": "The diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis can be difficult. Although the diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms, especially in a person who is at high risk of tuberculosis, it can only be confirmed with tests. Often, several tests are needed. These may include: 7 8 A computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or ultrasound to look for TB in internal organs Taking a sample of the affected part of the body and testing it for the presence of the bacteria, such as from urine, the lymph glands near the skin, spinal fluid or the lung. An examination of the inside of the body with an endoscope – a long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end – which is inserted through a natural opening, such as the mouth, or through a small cut made in the skin A lumbar puncture, in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is taken from the base of the spine A chest X-ray to look for tuberculosis infection in the lungs A skin, urine or blood test for the presence of antibodies to TB bacteria, which indicates exposure to it in the past Good to know: People with suspected disseminated TB  may be offered an HIV test because people with HIV are much more likely to develop disseminated TB. Treatment may be needed for both conditions.",
    "treatment": "Disseminated tuberculosis is treated with a combination of antibiotics. This is the same treatment for tuberculosis in the lungs, but disseminated TB usually needs a longer course of antibiotics. It may take 6 to 12 months to completely treat the infection. It is very important to take TB medicines as instructed, otherwise the infection can become much more difficult to treat, as the bacteria become antibiotic-resistant, meaning the medicines no longer work. 7 A hospital stay may be needed to prevent spreading the disease to others, until a person is no longer contagious. 5 This will depend upon the policies of the country, in which the person is recovering and the strain of tuberculosis contracted.",
    "other_names_used_for_disseminated_tuberculosis": "Disseminated TB Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Widespread tuberculosis Tuberculosis outside the lungs Miliary tuberculosis or tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata (disseminated tuberculosis that is spread by the blood) Tuberculosis acuta generalisata (a rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis)",
    "faqs": "Q: Are miliary TB and disseminated TB the same thing? A: They are used by some interchangeably. However, they refer to slightly different things. The term miliary TB originally referred to the appearance of the involved lung: on a chest x-ray, the small, firm white nodules on the surface of the lung resembled millet seeds. It now means disseminated TB that is spread through the bloodstream, i.e. when a tuberculosis lesion erodes into a blood vessel, disseminating millions of tubercle bacilli into the bloodstream and throughout the body. Some use miliary incorrectly, to describe any disseminated TB, whether or not it has the classic millet-like appearance associated with spread through the bloodstream. 1 9 Q: What is the difference between pulmonary TB and disseminated TB? A: Tuberculosis is usually contained in the lungs, when it is known as pulmonary tuberculosis. Tuberculosis that has spread to other organs is known as disseminated tuberculosis. Q: Can disseminated tuberculosis be fatal? A: With treatment, most people will recover from disseminated tuberculosis. However, without treatment, such as may be the case for people living in developing countries, fatality may be likely. 5"

    "condition": "Diverticulitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/diverticulitis/",
    "what_is_diverticulitis": "Diverticular disease (also diverticulosis) is a condition in which the bowel (large intestine) forms small pouches (diverticula) that bulge outward through the bowel wall. This typically develops due to increased pressure in the bowel, weakness of the bowel wall, or from straining during bowel movements. Many people with diverticular disease have no symptoms, or symptoms that are not very troublesome. Some people with diverticular disease experience constipation, diarrhea and low belly pain. More troublesome symptoms are sometimes the result of infection or inflammation in these pouches (diverticulitis). The symptoms of infection may come on quickly, and include blood in the stool and fever. Treatment is only required in people who experience symptoms. This may involve antibiotics or, rarely, surgery.",
    "symptoms": "Many people with diverticular disease do not have symptoms until they develop diverticulitis. Typical symptoms include changes in bowel habits (alternating diarrhea and constipation), bloating, nausea, vomiting and belly pain. If the diverticula are infected and inflamed, they may cause fever, belly pain and blood and pus in the stool. Symptoms are due to inflammation, irritation and sometimes infections forming in the out-pouching of the bowel.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of medical history and physical examination. A computed tomography (CT) scan may be needed to identify the location of the inflammation in the bowel and confirm the diagnosis.",
    "treatment": "Treatment is based on the severity and stage of diverticular disease. Affected people with no symptoms usually do not need treatment. People who have diverticulitis (infection and inflammation of the pouches) may receive antibiotics to treat the infection. In severe or complicated cases, surgery might be needed to stop bleeding, drain pus, or even remove parts of the bowel. However this is very uncommon.",
    "risks": "The risk of getting diverticular disease and diverticulitis increases with age, and most commonly affects people older than 60 years of age. Eating a low-fiber diet (a diet high in processed foods) has often been seen as a cause, although the link is not clear.",
    "prognosis": "Many people with diverticular disease do not have symptoms and do not require any treatment. Diverticulitis (inflammation and infection of the pouches) is often treated with antibiotics and people recover well if there are no complications. Some people may experience recurrent episodes of diverticulitis. Younger people may have a higher risk of severe disease and recurrence.",
    "prevention": "Eating foods which are high in fiber may help prevent diverticular disease and episodes of inflammation of the pouches (diverticulitis).",

    "condition": "Donovanosis (granuloma inguinale)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/donovanosis/",
    "what_is_donovanosis": "Donovanosis, also known as granuloma inguinale, is a condition primarily transmitted through sexual contact, which is why it’s considered an STD (sexually transmitted disease) . Besides sexual contact, it can also spread from one person to another through casual skin-to-skin contact. A mother may also transmit donovanosis to her child when giving birth. This condition is caused by a bacteria called klebsiella granulomatis . Donovanosis is rare , but it still has to be considered for people living in, or returning from, tropical and subtropical areas such as India, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, and certain parts of South America. Donovanosis is an STD that can occur at the same time as other bacterial infections or other STDs such as syphilis , HIV , chlamydia , trichomonas and gonorrhea . 1 2",
    "what_does_donovanosis_look_like": "Donovanosis symptoms usually present as a painless, red lump on the skin of the genital area . This lump grows larger, breaks down, and forms an ulcer. This ulcer begins to spread and causes multiple ulcers in the region, especially on the vulva, the penis, or around the anus. These genital ulcers are usually painless and can bleed easily. This is because the lesions are highly vascular, which means they are full of blood vessels, giving them a beefy red appearance. The ulcers mostly occur on the genitals, the perineum, or the anal region, but the bacteria can also spread to the organs which can be life-threatening. In very rare cases , the infection can also affect the bones. Donovanosis lesions can also be proliferative, meaning that the cells in the lesions have the ability to duplicate, causing the lesion to grow bigger. A donovanosis ulcer can also cause a foul smell when there’s another bacterial infection present at the same time. Donovanosis is a chronic and progressive condition that can cause permanent damage to tissues, especially if left untreated. However, it’s not a flesh-eating STD, as claimed by some. The ulcers can grow very deep, leaving no other option but to surgically remove them, which has led to the false impression that the bacteria is flesh-eating. 1 2",
    "what_are_long_term_effects": "When donovanosis doesn’t get treated, various complications may occur . The bacteria may travel through the blood and reach the bones or organs. When the bacteria spread, this can often be to the uterus and other nearby organs. Untreated donovanosis may also cause damage to the lymphatic system . This system supports various crucial processes in the body, such as fluid balance and the immune system. As donovanosis causes damage to this system, there may be a fluid build-up, which may cause swelling of the genitalia. 3 People with donovanosis also tend to have a higher risk of contracting HIV. Untreated ulcers also have a high possibility of evolving into carcinogenic lesions, so it’s important to treat donovanosis as soon as possible. 2",
    "how_to_prevent_getting_donovanosis": "Donovanosis can be prevented by practising safe sex with the correct use of a condom. The condition is transmitted through contact with sores, so it’s important to be aware and have frank conversations with sexual partners. Scientists are still unsure about the incubation period of donovanosis. Some people have an incubation period of 1 to 4 weeks, while in others it can take up to a year after exposure for the condition to present itself. People are most infectious when the ulcers are actively present. 4 5",
    "how_is_donovanosis_diagnosed": "Donovanosis is curable, but early diagnosis is necessary to avoid severe complications. The doctor will first ask you questions about your symptoms and your sexual history.During a physical exam, the doctor will look for the ulcerative lesions that donovanosis causes. As there are various conditions that can cause genital ulcers in both men and women, such as cancer, herpes simplex and syphilis, more tests will be necessary to come to a final diagnosis. The doctor may sample tissue from the lesion and place it under a microscope. This is called a biopsy and will help determine if there’s an infection or a malignancy. If there’s an infection, the biopsy will also help determine which bacteria or virus is causing it. Biopsy samples from people who have donovanosis will show a specific organism called donovan bodies, which confirms the diagnosis of donovanosis. 5 6 7",
    "how_is_donovanosis_treated": "Donovanosis treatment will see the person having to take antibiotics until all ulcers are healed. It’s important to completely finish the course of antibiotics, as the bacteria can still be present when you’re already feeling better. Finishing the course makes sure that all bacteria have been killed so that the infection is appropriately dealt with. It’s important to know that a donovanosis infection can reoccur 6-18 months after treatment. That’s why follow-up is important and why retreatment might be necessary if the infection comes back. The sores will slowly heal with treatment, but they can leave scars. 1 Besides treatment with antibiotics, it’s important to thoroughly wash everything that has been in contact with the ulcers, such as underwear and bed sheets. It’s also important to notify any sexual partners you have been in contact with for the last 60 days. In cases where treatment wasn’t started early enough, it’s possible that surgery is necessary to remove the ulcers. Ulcers that remain on the body may evolve into cancer, so it’s crucial that these are treated appropriately. As donovanosis often occurs in combination with other STDs, your doctor will also check for other sexually transmitted diseases, as these can often be present without any clear symptoms. This screening is important, as untreated STDs can have serious complications such as infertility, cancer, and even death. 4 8",
    "donovanosis_faqs": "Q: What is granuloma inguinale? A: Granuloma inguinale is a synonym for donovanosis. Granuloma refers to a mass of inflamed tissue, whereas inguinale refers to the groin area. Q: How do you get donovanosis? A: Donovanosis is spread by being in contact with an infected person. Usually, this contact is sexual, although donovanosis can also be spread through casual skin-to-skin contact. Q: How common is donovanosis? A: Donovanosis is a very rare disease due to successful bacteria eradication programs. Most cases are reported by people living in tropical or subtropical regions or by people that have traveled there. Q: Do Donovanosis tests exist? A: The best way to confirm an infection with the bacteria that causes donovanosis is by means of a biopsy."

    "condition": "Ectopic Pregnancy",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/ectopic-pregnancy/",
    "what_is_an_ectopic_pregnancy": "An ectopic pregnancy , also known as an extrauterine pregnancy, is a fairly common pregnancy complication, in which a fertilized egg implants and develops outside of the uterus, also known as the womb. The word ectopic means ‘out of place’. In about 95 percent of cases, the fertilized ovum, also known as an egg, implants in one of the fallopian tubes. This is often due to scarring from previous infection or other abnormalities in the pelvic area, but it can also happen without a clear cause.\n\nThe symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain and absence of menstruation. However, some people experience symptoms that are similar to those found in gastroenteritis , also known as stomach flu, and miscarriage. 1 Ectopic pregnancy may also be asymptomatic. While most people make a good recovery from an ectopic pregnancy, the condition can be life -threatening if left untreated. An ectopic pregnancy cannot be moved to the uterus to grow normally and almost never survives until birth. It may pass out of the cervix on its own, though medical or surgical intervention is normally required. 2 Many people experience emotional distress after an ectopic pregnancy, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy. A range of therapeutic treatment options are available.",
    "ectopic_pregnancy_symptoms": "If symptoms of ectopic pregnancy occur, they typically appear early on in the pregnancy, sometimes before a person realizes they are pregnant .\n\nThe most common early signs and symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy include: 2 3 4 Lower stomach pain. Ectopic pregnancy pain is often located on one side of the body Vaginal bleeding, which may be dark, watery and heavier, lighter or more prolonged than a normal period Pregnancy symptoms such as a missed menstrual period, breast tenderness, frequent urination or nausea However, it is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without any of the above symptoms.\n\nLess common symptoms include: Bowel and bladder problems, such as diarrhea, and pain when defecating or urinating A feeling of fullness when lying down that is not associated with eating, particularly in people who have already had a child Back pain It is possible to have an ectopic pregnancy without experiencing any symptoms until rupture of the fallopian tube or close organs. After rupture, signs and symptoms may include: 3 Severe stomach pain Vaginal bleeding Lightheadedness, sometimes followed by fainting Shoulder pain, described as a strange pain that feels different to any pain that a person has otherwise experienced, located at the tip of the shoulder, where it joins the arm, caused by internal bleeding",
    "what_causes_ectopic_pregnancy": "When a person becomes pregnant, the sperm and the egg, also known as an ovum, join in the fallopian tube, the tube that carries the ovum from the ovary to the uterus. Usually, the fertilized egg passes along the fallopian tube and into the uterus and implants into the lining of the uterus, known as the endometrium, where it will grow and develop. Ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and starts to grow outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. This is often due to scarring from previous infections or other abnormalities in the tube’s shape, for instance a birth defect. As the ectopic pregnancy gets bigger, it can run out of space to grow and rupture the fallopian tube, causing severe pain and internal bleeding. Rarely, an ectopic pregnancy can also occur in other places, such as the ovary or inside the abdomen.",
    "risk_factors": "The following factors may not be the sole cause of a person experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, but they are linked to a heightened risk of ectopic pregnancy: 3 5 Previous ectopic pregnancy: If a person has experienced an ectopic pregnancy already, they have an increased risk of having another one. Fertility treatment: Embryo transfer during in vitro fertilization (IVF) can occasionally result in ectopic pregnancy if, for example, an embryo travels into the fallopian tube. Infertility: Women with infertility have a two or three times higher risk of ectopic pregnancy, possibly reflecting the increased number of people in this group who have tubal abnormalities, which may also be a cause of infertility. 6 Age: The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with age. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) : Previous infection of the pelvic region, commonly chlamydia and gonorrhea, can sometimes damage the fallopian tubes. Tubal sterilization: People who become pregnant after tubal sterilization, either because it has failed or because they have had it reversed, are at higher risk. Cesarean section: An embryo can implant in the scar tissue of the uterus lining, caused by cesarean section. Copper contraceptive coil (IUD): IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD. 3 An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception. Smoking tobacco: This can hinder the transfer of the ovum to the uterus by decreasing the ability of the muscles in the fallopian tube walls to contract. In-utero diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure: Exposure before birth to DES, a synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women from the 1940s to 1970s to prevent pregnancy complications, has been found to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy by about four times. 6",
    "types": "The kind of ectopic pregnancy a person has depends on where the fertilized egg implants.\n\nAlso known as tubal pregnancy, a fallopian ectopic pregnancy can be further divided into three sub-types: Ampullary (in the middle part of the fallopian tube), accounting for 80% of ectopic pregnancies Isthmic (in the upper part of the fallopian tube close to the uterus), accounting for 12% of ectopic pregnancies Fimbrial (at the end of the tube), accounting for 5% of ectopic pregnancies The tube has a delicate structure made up of cilia, which are tiny hair-like projections, and mucus-producing cells, which work together to propel an ovum, fertilized in the fallopian tube, to the uterus to implant, over the space of about four days. Sometimes, the transportation of the developing embryo is slow, perhaps for reasons of inflammation or infection of the fallopian tube or for no obvious reason. In such cases, it can be implanted in the fallopian tube. About 95 percent of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube.\n\nThere are other types of ectopic pregnancies, all of which are rare . These include: 7 Interstitial pregnancy: This occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall. It is typically hard to diagnose and can therefore be particularly dangerous, as it may progress further and rupture later, damaging both the fallopian tube and the uterus wall. Cervical ectopic pregnancy: Pregnancy in the cervix – the passage between the womb and vagina – is one of the rarest forms of ectopic pregnancy and carries a risk of life-threatening vaginal hemorrhage. This is due to the possibility of heavy bleeding when the ectopic pregnancy tissue separates from the cervix, which contains many blood vessels. Ovarian ectopic pregnancy: This is typically difficult to diagnose, as it can appear very similar to a tubal ectopic pregnancy that is stuck to the ovary. It is usually not diagnosed until surgery, when partial or complete removal of the ovary will usually be necessary. Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies: This occurs when a fertilized egg implants into the scar from a cesarean section. The pregnancy can grow out of the uterus or into the cervix, which can lead to massive internal or vaginal bleeding. In some cases, the fetus may be able to survive until birth, but with the risk of significant maternal bleeding and removal of the womb, known as hysterectomy, at delivery. Intramural pregnancy: This is a difficult-to-diagnose pregnancy that implants outside of the womb cavity, but within its muscular wall. It may occur if the uterus is scarred from surgery or if a condition called adenomyosis is present, in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus. Abdominal pregnancy: Pregnancies in the abdomen are thought to start as tubal pregnancies, before separating from the wall of the fallopian tube and passing into the abdominal cavity, where they reattach. These can take many weeks before showing symptoms. Heterotopic pregnancy: This term describes the co-existence of an intrauterine pregnancy and an ectopic pregnancy. The intrauterine twin is able to survive until birth in about one third of cases, after surgical treatment of the ectopic pregnancy.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy usually begins with a physical exam and taking the person’s medical history. A person may be referred to a gynecology clinic for further assessment. Ectopic pregnancies are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including: Ultrasound Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test Laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) if the previous exam results are still ambiguous\n\nUltrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing pregnancy. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed in two different ways: 8 Transvaginally: A scanning probe is inserted into the vagina. Transabdominally: Gel is spread onto the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area. In diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy, doctors will look for where the pregnancy is located in the ultrasound images. These can help them determine whether the person’s symptoms are being caused by an ectopic pregnancy, a healthy pregnancy or another condition. Ultrasound indicators for ectopic pregnancy include: 9 No pregnancy in the uterus, or a gestation sac in the uterus missing an embryo: This is a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). This is a label given until the pregnancy location can be found, and a diagnosis can be given. Many of these will not be ectopic and will not need treatment. No pregnancy in the uterus and a possible mass in the area of a fallopian tube: This would likely lead to diagnosis of a possible ectopic pregnancy.\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta, an organ that develops in the womb during pregnancy. A beta hCG blood test can detect hCG in the blood approximately 11 days after conception and establish the precise amount of hCG present. This might be used if a person has been pregnant for six weeks, but an ultrasound scan does not show a developing pregnancy in the uterus. The test may be repeated at intervals to measure changes in hCG levels. 10 Possible indicators for ectopic pregnancy from a beta hCG blood test include: 11 Declining hCG levels: This can be an indicator that the ectopic pregnancy has ended and is self-resolving or will be miscarried in the coming days or weeks. Slow rising hCG levels: If the levels rise more slowly than in a normal pregnancy, it is likely that the pregnancy is ectopic. In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels in the blood double about every two to four days throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak after 8-11 weeks and then decreasing before plateauing during the second trimester.\n\nRarely, laparoscopy, a type of keyhole surgery, is used to confirm the diagnosis, if hCG and ultrasound results are ambiguous. Under general anesthetic, a laparoscope, a narrow instrument with a camera and light on the end, is inserted through a small cut, usually into the belly button, to look at the pelvis. If an ectopic pregnancy is found, treatment to remove it may take place during the same operation. 3",
    "treatments_for_ectopic_pregnancy": "An ectopic pregnancy can be life threatening if left untreated and normally requires medical or surgical intervention to remove it. However, in some cases, when it is diagnosed early, ectopic pregnancy may be monitored to see if it will resolve on its own. Treatment options depend on: HCG levels How many weeks pregnant the affected person is Size and impact of the ectopic pregnancy as shown on an ultrasound Pain levels General health The options the hospital has available Personal views and preferences, such as future pregnancy plans\n\nAlso known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting to see if the ectopic pregnancy tissue passes out of the cervix on its own, instead of undergoing immediate treatment. Expectant management is only offered as an option in some cases of very early diagnosis. Candidates for expectant management of ectopic pregnancy should: 12 Be asymptomatic Show signs that the ectopic pregnancy is resolving, such as declining beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels Not show signs of rupture Not show signs of hemodynamic instability (abnormal blood pressure) Have easy access to a hospital and be prepared to continue with follow-up Be willing to accept the potential risks of tubal rupture The approach involves close monitoring by medical professionals through repeated blood tests to check that hCG levels are dropping. It can take a few weeks or sometimes months for this to happen. About half of ectopic pregnancies may resolve on their own where there is a drop in hCG levels. If a person develops new symptoms, another ultrasound scan may be done, and treatment options will be reassessed. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned.\n\nSometimes, an ectopic pregnancy may be treated with a medication called methotrexate. This stops the growth of the embryo and typically allows surgery to be avoided. Medical management may be suitable if a diagnosis has been made very early. Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option if the pregnancy is located in the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual portion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. Methotrexate is administered as an injection, usually a single shot into the buttock muscle. After the injection, there may be an overnight stay in hospital, and regular follow-up visits will be needed for a few weeks to monitor hCG levels until they return to normal. Some people will need a second injection of methotrexate. Very occasionally, surgery will still be required. Some pain is likely in the first few days after the injection, but this can usually be controlled with paracetamol. Certain substances should be avoided during treatment, including: 3 Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g., ibuprofen or naprosyn, as they can interact with methotrexate and reduce its effectiveness Alcoholic beverages, as the liver will be working hard to metabolise methotrexate Supplements containing folic acid, as this can interact with methotrexate, preventing it from achieving the desired effect\n\nThere are two possible aims for surgical management, which will be decided depending on damage to the affected fallopian tube and the condition of the other tube. These are: 12 Total salpingectomy: This involves removal of the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy and is normally recommended for people who either do not want to have any children in future, who have had another ectopic pregnancy in the same fallopian tube, or who have severely damaged tubes. This reduces the risk of a persistent ectopic pregnancy, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies. Total salpingectomy may also be chosen in cases of uncontrolled bleeding and abnormal blood pressure. Linear salpingostomy: This is a more conservative approach, involving a surgical incision into a fallopian tube, which aims to remove the ectopic pregnancy without removing the tube. This is normally recommended for people who have an unruptured ectopic pregnancy in the ampullary (middle) portion of the tube. This may also be chosen if the person only has one tube, or their other tube does not seem to be healthy. It carries a higher risk of future ectopic pregnancy and persistent ectopic pregnancy, but still leaves the possibility of a future uterine pregnancy. However, salpingostomy is not always possible. The operation will be performed under general anesthetic in one of two ways: Laparoscopy: This is keyhole surgery involving minimal incisions. Recovery is about two to four weeks, though this varies from person to person. Laparotomy: This is open surgery, which is used if severe internal bleeding is suspected. It involves a larger incision in the lower abdomen. Recovery is about four to six weeks, though this varies from person to person.",
    "complications": "An ectopic pregnancy may rupture the fallopian tube, leading to heavy bleeding, which can cause serious medical problems and may, occasionally, be life-threatening. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy requires emergency, life-saving surgery. Symptoms of a rupture include: 1 A sudden, intense stomach pain Dizziness or fainting Looking pale Rapid pulse In surgery, the ruptured Fallopian tube and remnant of the ectopic pregnancy are removed.\n\nThere are some possible, but very rare complications after surgery, as well as side effects from taking methotrexate. A doctor will discuss these with the person affected by ectopic pregnancy, before commencing treatment. 1\n\nA persistent ectopic pregnancy may occur, in which some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or further ectopic pregnancies occur. If there is no history of diseases of the fallopian tubes, the chances of having another ectopic pregnancy may not be much higher than in a person who has not previously had an ectopic pregnancy. If a person has some of the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, as listed above, then the risk of problems in the future increases.\n\nMost women will make a full recovery from ectopic pregnancy and will be able to conceive normally in future. Rarely, fertility may be affected, especially in the case of ruptured ectopic pregnancy or if a fallopian tube is removed in treatment. If treatment has involved any kind of surgery, the risk of fertility problems is higher than if medical treatment or no treatment was needed. 1",
    "ectopic_pregnancy_and_emotions": "It is normal to feel distressed after an ectopic pregnancy. It can mean coming to terms with the loss of a baby, with a potential impact on future fertility or, for some, with the thought of having nearly lost their life. In some people, these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated. According to the Miscarriage Association, a  person with ectopic pregnancy may be emotionally affected in a variety of ways, including: 13 Shock: A person may experience shock about the diagnosis, especially in cases where there has been emergency surgery or about what might have happened without diagnosis. Loss and grief: It is normal to feel grief for the baby that was expected. Feeling ‘in limbo’ and unable to move on: It is common to feel frustrated at having to wait some time before being able to try again and having to have follow-up and repeated blood and urine tests. Counseling is available for people affected by an ectopic pregnancy. Support groups are also available and may be able to put a person in touch with others in a similar situation. A health professional will be able to provide advice on choosing the most appropriate kind of support for a person, couple or family who has experienced an ectopic pregnancy.",
    "other_names_for_ectopic_pregnancy": "Extrauterine pregnancy Tubal pregnancy Interstitial pregnancy Cervical ectopic pregnancy Ovarian ectopic pregnancy Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies Intramural pregnancy Abdominal pregnancy Heterotopic pregnancy",
    "ectopic_pregnancy_faqs": "Q: How common is ectopic pregnancy? A: About one in 50 pregnancies are ectopic. 14 Many early ectopic pregnancies resolve on their own, without treatment. Some ectopic pregnancies will resolve before they produce symptoms. Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with a copper coil (IUD)? A: IUDs ensure a very low risk of any pregnancy, either intrauterine or ectopic. However, if a person does conceive, the probability of the pregnancy being ectopic is higher than in women not using an IUD. 3 An IUD is still more protective against ectopic pregnancy than not using contraception. 14 Q: Can a person have an ectopic pregnancy with IVF? A: Yes, in vitro fertilization puts a person at higher risk of ectopic pregnancy. It may increase the occurrence of unusual types of ectopic pregnancies, such as heterotopic pregnancy, in which there is simultaneous intrauterine and tubal pregnancies, and interstitial pregnancy, which occurs in the part of the fallopian tube embedded in the uterus wall. 15 Q: Is it possible to miscarry an ectopic pregnancy? A: In the very early stages, the fetus may pass out of the cervix on its own, without the need for further treatment. This may result in some symptoms of miscarriage being present. As the fetus develops, it becomes less likely that it will pass out of the womb on its own, and medical or surgical management will be needed to remove it. However, the techniques used to treat ectopic pregnancy may differ from those used to treat incomplete miscarriage. See this resource on miscarriage for more information. Q: Is prevention of ectopic pregnancy possible? A: Preventing ectopic pregnancy is not normally possible. Adequate use of contraceptives significantly reduces the risk of ectopic pregnancy. A person may be able to prevent a tubal pregnancy in the fallopian tube, if things that scar the tube, such as smoking and exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), can be avoided. In some cases of ectopic pregnancy, a person may have surgery to remove the tube containing the ectopic pregnancy, which will reduce the risk of further ectopic pregnancies or  persistent ectopic pregnancy. This occurs if some ectopic cells are left behind and continue to grow, or if there are subsequent ectopic pregnancies."

    "condition": "Endocarditis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/endocarditis/",
    "what_is_endocarditis": "Endocarditis is a rare infection of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium) and theheart valves, usually caused by germs (or, less commonly, fungus) entering the bloodstreamand passing into the heart. 1 However, a rare, non-infective variant also exists. Non-infectiveendocarditis is a build-up of clots on the endocardium or cardiac valves, caused by certainmedical conditions, including some types of cancer, pregnancy and trauma. 2 Endocarditis treatment will usually involve a course of antibiotics and – in rare cases,usually when complications arise – surgery. If left untreated, the condition can cause severedamage to the heart and result in life-threatening complications. Early diagnosis is criticalto improving the prognosis of those with endocarditis. 3",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of endocarditis may include: 4 Fever and chills Fatigue and night sweats Loss of appetite Weight loss Generally feeling unwell Pain in the muscles or joints Shortness of breath and coughing Chest pain when breathing Swelling of the legs, ankles or feet Less common symptoms may include: Blood in the urine Tenderness in the upper half of the abdomen Red spots on the hands or feet Red-purple bumps under the skin of the toes or fingers (Osler’s nodes) Small red or purple spots on the skin, inside the mouth or on the whites of the eyes Back pain Non- infective endocarditis will generally present fewer symptoms than infective endocarditisand they are unlikely to develop until the later stages of the condition or when complicationsarise. Symptoms of infective endocarditis can either develop slowly or rapidly (in a numberof days) depending on what kind of bacteria or fungi is causing the condition. Complications can develop quickly, making the condition more difficult to treat. For thisreason, it is important to see a doctor early when worrying symptoms occur. If you are experiencing symptoms or feel unwell, you can use the free Ada app to do a symptom assessment at any time.",
    "causes": "Endocarditis most often occurs in people with preexisting heart disease (which may bediagnosed or undiagnosed) and less commonly in people with normal hearts. Endocarditis may occur when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream through small injuries(such as those experienced during teeth cleaning), when injecting into the veins, duringsurgery, or as a result of other infections. If the bacteria or fungi reach the heart, theymay settle on the endocardium (the heart’s inner lining or valves) and begin to grow – causingan infection. Ordinarily, the immune system is able to clear bacteria and fungi that enter the bloodstream.When this does not happen, however, some bacteria or fungi can settle on the endocardium orvalves of the heart (especially likely if a valve is already damaged in some way) and formsmall growths (vegetations). These growths can prevent the heart from functioning correctlyand may break off and infect other areas of the body. While endocarditis is a rare condition, the following groups are most at risk: 5 People with previously damaged heart valves or an artificial heart valve Users of injected drugs such as heroin It should also be noted that any procedure that requires placing medical devices into theveins or any type of heart surgery can also be a risk factor. Those most at risk of non-infective endocarditis include people with the following conditions: 6 Systemic lupus erythematosus Antiphospholipid syndrome Stomach cancer , lung cancer or pancreatic cancer If you are feeling unwell, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",
    "diagnosing_endocarditis": "If a diagnosis of endocarditis is suspected based on the symptoms and medical history, athorough physical examination will be carried out, paying particular attention to the heart. 7 In particular, doctor’s will listen for heart murmurs (unusual sounds from the heart), whichcan be an indicator of the condition. A doctor will in most cases then also order a seriesof tests to confirm the diagnosis. Blood tests will be ordered in order to identify any bacteria or fungi present in the blood.An ultrasound of the heart may also be able to show signs of any abnormal growths on theheart valve, as well as any damage to the heart. Further diagnostic tests (X rays, CT scan, MRI,ECG) can also be carried out to investigate any involvement in other organs . 8 If blood tests reveal no sign of infection but other symptoms and risk factors are present,the diagnosis of non-infective endocarditis may still be possible. 9",
    "endocarditis_treatment": "Many cases of (infective) endocarditis can be effectively treated with antibiotics orantifungal medication. If the growth is very large, or if there is new or pre-existingdamage to the heart, surgery may be required. 10\n\nAs soon as possible after diagnosis, an individual with infective endocarditis will be treatedwith antibiotics, usually intravenously (through a drip). The course will last for severalweeks, a period through which most people will be required to stay in hospital. If an individual continues to feel unwell after a number of days of treatment using antibiotics,or if new symptoms occur, it is important to inform a doctor.\n\nIf the endocarditis causes severe damage to the heart, or infections are persistent, surgerymay be necessary. The goal is generally repair a damaged valve or replace a valve entirely.Surgery can be life-saving, but it is a risky procedure with possible complications.\n\nTreatment for non-infective endocarditis generally involves treating the underlying conditionthat is its cause. Drugs to prevent the formation of new blood clots may be prescribed, butthis will depend on the doctor and the underlying causes of the condition. 11",
    "endocarditis_complications": "Complications will generally arise if endocarditis is left untreated or if it is treated too late. The two most serious complications of endocarditis are heart failure and sepsis . If growths in the heart break up and spread to other areas of the body, complications including abscesses, strokes and – in some cases – seizures are possible. Heart failure, sepsis and seizures are all medical emergencies and if they occur, the affected person should receive medical assistance as soon as possible.",
    "endocarditis_prevention": "To help prevent endocarditis, it is important – especially for those who are particularly vulnerableto the disorder – to be aware of its signs and symptoms. Through this awareness, if any signs orsymptoms occur, it will be possible to seek medical assistance without delay. It is also important to maintain high standards of dental hygiene and to receive regular checkupsfrom a dentist. This will help prevent any bacteria from the mouth passing into the bloodstream.Individuals should also avoid getting tattoos and piercings – activities that can lead to infection. People with a known high risk of developing endocarditis may also be given preventative antibioticsbefore dental or medical procedures. This decision, however, is left to the discretion of the doctoror dentist. 12 Users of injected drugs (such as heroin) should use only sterile syringes, needles and other apparatus,and never share syringes with others in order to reduce the risk of infection.",
    "endocarditis_prognosis": "Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis for endocarditis, with many people recoveringafter receiving appropriate treatment. If left untreated, however, the condition often becomeslife-threatening. Older people, those with a particularly resistant infection, those with particularlylarge growths and those with underlying medical conditions have a higher probability of experiencingcomplications as a result of the condition. 13 The prognosis for those with non-infective endocarditis is dependent on the underlying medical conditionthat is the cause of the condition. 14",
    "endocarditis_faqs": "Q: What is the prognosis for endocarditis? A: The prognosis for endocarditis can be significantly improved if the condition is detected early and treatment begun quickly. If left untreated, the condition can be life-threatening. In cases of non-infective endocarditis, the prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the cause of the condition. Q: When should I seek medical attention for suspected endocarditis? A: People who have an ongoing fever, chills and shortness of breath, or who have any other worrisome symptoms, should see a doctor for review of these symptoms. Those at higher risk of the condition (people with a damaged heart, those who have had a valve repair or replacement or injected drug users) should make themselves aware of the symptoms and see a doctor as soon as any of these they occur. Q: Can I receive preventative treatment for endocarditis? A: People at high risk of contracting endocarditis may be given preventative treatment, which will usually take the form of antibiotics to help the body combat a possible infection. People with a damaged heart, heart disease and users of injected drugs should consult a doctor about the possibility of using preventive treatment methods. A doctor will be able to assess the probability of endocarditis and explain the options from there. Preventative measures may be particularly important before surgical and dental procedures. 15"

    "what_is_endometrial_cancer": "Endometrial cancer, or uterine cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the uterus or womb (the endometrium). This condition is most common in women who have been through menopause. Common symptoms are vaginal bleeding after menopause and pain low in the abdomen. Treatment may consist of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The recovery and outlook depends on the stage of the cancer at the time of diagnosis.",
    "risks": "Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollably. These cells tend to destroy normal cells around them, and sometimes spread into other body areas through blood or lymph vessels. Endometrial cancer is a cancer originating from the cells which line the uterus. This condition is most common in women who have been through menopause (women over 50 years of age). Other factors that increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer include obesity; never having given birth; the use of hormone-containing medications (including tamoxifen to treat breast cancer, and hormone replacement therapy); and smoking. People who have a family member with endometrial cancer have a higher risk of developing this condition.",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina after menopause. This might appear as spontaneous bleeding, or bleeding after sexual intercourse. Women who have not been through menopause may notice bleeding between periods. Other symptoms include pain felt low in the abdomen, or low belly pain during sexual intercourse.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and an ultrasound of the uterus. A tissue sample of the cancer (a biopsy) is taken and investigated to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of uterine cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors determines the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, endometrial cancer can be treated by radiation therapy, surgery to remove the uterus, chemotherapy, or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",
    "prevention": "The use of the oral contraceptive pill (the pill) may help to prevent some cases of endometrial cancer. Giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also be helpful.",

    "what_are_endometrial_polyps": "Endometrial polyps, also called uterine polyps, are growths in the interior of the uterus or womb, formed of an overgrowth of the cells (endometrium) that line this cavity. They may occur alone or in clusters and are typically less than a centimeter in diameter, but in rare cases can grow much larger – for example, to the size of a golf ball or an orange. 1 2 Symptoms in adults, both pre and postmenopausal, commonly include unusual bleeding. Polyps are more common in people who have not yet experienced menopause than those who have. This may be because endometrial polyps seem to be reactive to estrogen levels. However, much is unknown about the formation of these polyps. They rarely occur in adolescents. Endometrial polyps can affect a woman’s fertility and, in rare cases, be linked to cancer. 1 2",
    "uterine_polyp_symptoms": "Common symptoms of endometrial polyps include: 1 2 Irregular menstrual bleeding. Menstrual bleeding that is shorter or longer in length than usual, or that occurs at unexpected times Spotting or bleeding between menstrual periods Unusually heavy bleeding during periods Unusual appearance of brown blood after a menstrual period Spotting or bleeding after menopause Spotting or bleeding after sexual intercourse Severe menstrual cramping, though this is uncommon Infertility Many of these symptoms do not arise from the formation of the polyp itself, but because of rubbing and irritation of the surrounding tissue. Most endometrial polyps are small, and many people who experience them will never develop symptoms. Pain is not a typical symptom of uterine polyps. 3 People experiencing possible symptoms of endometrial polyps should seek medical attention. In addtion, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "endometrial_polyp_causes": "Endometrial polyps are caused by the overgrowth of endometrial tissue, which is the lining of the uterus that swells and then shrinks during the menstrual cycle. Endometrial polyps are estrogen-sensitive, with hormones in the bloodstream playing a role in their occurrence. 2 4",
    "risk_factors": "Women over 40 who have not experienced menopause , and those who have had children, are considered to be at greater risk of developing endometrial polyps. Other risk factors include: 1 2 5 6 Going through perimenopause Hormone replacement therapy after menopause, particularly where the dose of estrogen is high Obesity Treatment with the medication tamoxifen for breast cancer , after menopause Endometrial polyps may recur. People who have had polyps in the past are somewhat more likely to develop them in the future, compared to those who have never had them. 1 3 People worried about developing endometrial polyps can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "diagnosis": "Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the first-line method for evaluating women with abnormal vaginal bleeding. During a TVUS, a thin, wand-like device is placed inside the vagina and uterus, where it emits ultrasonic waves. The doctor may be able to identify a uterine polyp by examining this ultrasound. 2 If the ultrasound finding is uncertain, there are two other options. One is where the physician carries out a more specialized ultrasound, called a sonohysterography or a saline infusion sonogram (SIS). In this procedure, the doctor injects a small amount of saline into the uterus to expand the uterine cavity and provide a clearer picture. 2 The second option, should a TVUS be uncertain, is a hysteroscopy. This allows a more direct view of the inside of the uterus, using a hysteroscope: a lighted camera mounted on a flexible rod. The hysteroscope may be equipped with an additional tool to gather a biopsy sample. A suction catheter could also be used to gather an endometrial biopsy. The tissue sample will then be analyzed to see if it indicates uterine cancer. 2",
    "treatments_for_endometrial_polyps": "Small, asymptomatic polyps in people before menopause often require no treatment, but will instead be monitored for changes or an increase in symptoms. 2 A short-term option to address the symptoms of endometrial polyps is the use of hormonal treatments, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and progestins. However, since symptoms usually recur once treatment is stopped, this is not the preferred long-term treatment option. 2 Uterine polyp removal, called a polypectomy, which is carried out using a hysteroscopy, is the standard procedure. The doctor uses a camera attached to a long, thin tube to examine the interior of the uterus, locate the polyp and then remove it with an integrated wire loop or blade. It is typically screened for cancer. 3 The removal of small endometrial polyps using hysteroscopy can sometimes be done as an outpatient procedure at a doctor’s office, but removing large polyps may require a hospital stay. Many people are able to return to normal activities within the next few days. Side-effects of uterine polyp removal may include light spotting. 3",
    "preventing_endometrial_polyps_recurrence": "In most cases, endometrial polyps do not recur after they have been removed by polypectomy. 1 If they do recur, a repeat polypectomy procedure may be recommended. If a person is concerned, an intrauterine device (IUD) can be inserted into the uterus to help prevent a recurrence of uterine polyps. This contraceptive may be a good choice for those who hope to maintain their fertility. 1 Endomyometrial resection (EMR) – the surgical removal of around 5 mm of the uterine lining and some underlying muscle tissue – is another option, though this is a complex procedure and may not be appropriate for everyone. It is typically only recommended for people who do not wish to have children. 7",
    "endometrial_uterine_polyps_and_pregnancy": "It is thought that endometrial polyps may have a negative impact on a person’s fertility, but further research is needed in this field. Many doctors recommend removing polyps if the person is undergoing evaluation for infertility or has a history of miscarriage . 3 Nevertheless, studies do not suggest that endometrial polyps are associated with miscarriage. 8 4 If younger people who may wish to have children undergo polypectomy (surgery to remove the polyps), it must be ensured that the deep lining of the uterus is not damaged. 1 Read more about Pregnancy »",
    "uterine_polyps_faqs": "Q: Are uterine polyps related to cancer? A: Roughly 95 percent of the time, endometrial polyps are benign, meaning they are noncancerous. In about five percent of cases they are linked to cancer. If uterine polyps can develop into cancer, they are called precancerous. Among people with endometrial polyps, those presenting with bleeding and those older than 50 are more likely to have cancerous endometrial polyps. 3 9 Q: How are endometrial polyps different from uterine fibroids (leiomyoma)? A: Endometrial polyps are formed from the lining of the uterus and therefore only occur within the uterine cavity. Fibroids come from the uterine musculature and may arise on any part of the uterus interior, exterior or the uterine wall. Uterine polyps have roughly a 5 percent chance of being related to cancer (malignant), while fibroids have less than a 1 percent likelihood of malignancy. 4 10"

This abnormal growth can cause abdominal pain and is also linked to difficulty getting pregnant. With early treatment, the symptoms of the condition can be relieved and your chances of pregnancy can improve. In this article by Ada’s medical team, you can find a full guide on endometriosis, its symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.",
    "what_is_endometriosis": "Endometriosis is a chronic disease that affects about 10% of reproductive-age women worldwide. With endometriosis, tissue that resembles the lining of the uterus grows in other places , outside of the uterus. The additional growth usually occurs within the pelvis, although there are some rare cases in which endometriosis can also be found outside of the pelvis. Some places where endometriosis can commonly be found are the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the bladder, and the bowels. The unusual growth of this tissue can cause inflammation and scar tissue to form. This condition can have a severe impact on life, as it can cause many symptoms that decrease the quality of life. In severe cases, it can also affect your possibility of pregnancy. 1 Endometriosis can happen to any woman during the reproductive years, from the first menstruation to menopause . After menopause, the symptoms of endometriosis usually decrease, although in some cases they can also persist. 2",
    "what_are_the_stages": "Endometriosis stages can be helpful to assess how severe your endometriosis is. Endometriosis specialists classify the condition based on how many tissue growths there are, and how deep they have grown. 3 Stage 1 endometriosis : minimal endometriosis with only a few superficial tissue growths Stage 2 endometriosis : mild endometriosis with more and deeper tissue growths Stage 3 endometriosis : moderate endometriosis with many deep tissue growths, small cysts on the ovaries, and adhesion between tissues Stage 4 endometriosis : severe endometriosis with many deep tissue growths, large cysts on the ovaries, and severe adhesion between tissues",
    "what_are_the_warning_signs": "The symptoms of endometriosis can vary . Some women only experience mild discomfort or no signs of endometriosis at all, whereas others can have severe pain that impacts the quality of life. The most common endometriosis symptom is pain in the lower part of your belly or your back during periods, sexual intercourse, bowel movements, or urination . Although it’s more common to experience pain at these specific moments, some women also experience this pain for a longer period of time. Other common endometriosis symptoms include: 1 2 Heavy bleeding during or between periods Severe pain during your period Bloating Nausea Feeling tired Constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool or urine during your period Trouble getting pregnant Depression It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider if you experience any of these symptoms, as early detection can help you get to the correct treatment earlier on.",
    "what_causes_endometriosis": "Endometriosis's causes are not fully understood. Scientists have however indicated a few reasons that may contribute to the condition: 2 Genetics Issues with the immune system Retrograde menstruation , which means that period blood containing cells of the inner lining of the uterus flows back into the pelvic cavity. This can cause these cells to implant themselves in new locations where they can start to grow. Cells outside the uterus may change into cells that resemble the inner lining of the uterus during a process called cellular metaplasia . Cells from the inner lining of the uterus can spread to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system or the bloodstream Scientists believe that there is also a link between estrogen and endometriosis, although further research is still needed.",

How long this takes can be different for everyone. It’s important to keep a close eye on your symptoms and to follow up with your healthcare provider so that you can get the appropriate treatment when needed. 4",
    "how_is_endometriosis_diagnosed": "Endometriosis diagnosis can be made after a careful evaluation of your symptoms and your medical history. As endometriosis can present itself with symptoms similar to other conditions, it’s important that the diagnosis gets confirmed with a laparoscopy . This is a procedure in which a small camera is inserted into the lower belly so that your doctor can look for signs of endometriosis. 5",
    "treatment_for_endometriosis": "Endometriosis treatments focus on symptom relief , as there is no permanent cure available at this time. Your endometriosis treatment will be based on the aim of the treatment, which can be pain relief, removal of endometriosis tissue, increasing your chances of pregnancy or reducing the chance of endometriosis returning . Some possible treatment options are: 2 4 Pain medication such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to relieve your symptoms Hormone treatment to limit the production of estrogen in your body Surgery to remove the endometriosis tissue",
    "what_happens_if_endometriosis_is_left_untreated": "The main complication of endometriosis is difficulty getting pregnant . This happens as the tissue growth may cause damage to the fallopian tubes or the ovaries. By removing the endometriosis tissue, you can increase your fertility again, although this is not a certainty. In some cases, endometriosis can affect the bladder or the bowel , which can require major surgery to remove a part of your bladder or a section of your bowel. 4",
    "wrapping_up": "Endometriosis is a chronic condition that can cause severe symptoms and it can even lead to infertility. As the symptoms of this condition resemble those of other conditions, it’s important to provide your healthcare provider with as much information as possible, so that the diagnosis can be made early on and treatment can be initiated as soon as possible.",
    "endometriosis_faqs": "Q: Can you get pregnant with endometriosis? A: It’s possible to get pregnant if you have endometriosis, although difficulty getting pregnant is a known complication of the condition. Q: Does endometriosis cause infertility? A: Endometriosis and pregnancy difficulties are closely related, especially if the condition causes damage to the fallopian tubes or the ovaries. There are however possible treatments to improve your chances of pregnancy. Q: Is endometriosis genetic? A: Although the exact cause of endometriosis remains uncertain, it’s possible that there may be a genetic factor playing a role in the development of endometriosis. Q: Does endometriosis cause weight gain? A: Endometriosis doesn’t cause weight gain directly, although treatments for endometriosis can contribute to weight gain. Endometriosis also causes bloating, which can be mistaken for weight gain as well. Q: What is the main cause of endometriosis? A: The cause of endometriosis is thought to be related to cells from the inner lining of the uterus appearing and growing in other places of the body. This can happen because of retrograde menstruation, issues with estrogen, genetics , or issues with the immune system."

These include: 1 3 4 5 6 An urgent, at times uncontrollable, need to urinate, which may lead to incontinence if the person can’t make it to the bathroom in time Trouble urinating Frequent urination Urinary hesitancy, i.e. slow start till urine streams out Weak flow of urine Frequent need to urinate at night, known as nocturia Intermittent flow, i.e. stopping and starting Leaking or dribbling urine\n\nIn addition, prostatitis may also have some or all of the following symptoms: 7 Hematuria (blood in the urine) or blood in semen Pain in the penis and testicles Burning or painful sensation during urination Painful or difficult ejaculation Urethral discharge Pain and/or pressure in the rectum Painful defecation (painful bowel movements) Discomfort and/or pain in the genitals, groin, lower back and/or lower abdomen Recurring urinary tract infections (UTIs) Sexual problems and loss of sex drive Postcoital pain (pain after having sex) In the case of prostate cancer, there may be no immediate symptoms, or there may be urinary symptoms like those listed above. In addition, there may be symptoms such as: Hematuria (blood in the urine) or blood in semen New onset of erectile dysfunction Back, especially lower back, hip, or pelvic pain Unexplained weight loss",
    "what_causes_an_enlarged_prostate": "A variety of different conditions and biological processes can cause the prostate to become enlarged. These include:\n\nProstatitis is the painful inflammation of the prostate and can affect men of any age. There are several types of prostatitis: 8 Bacterial prostatitis Acute bacterial prostatitis Nonbacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis Bacterial prostatitis, the most common type of prostatitis , can affect all adult men and sometimes accompanies recurring urinary tract infections. 9 It can occur when bacteria from the bowel transfer to the skin, to the urethra and then up into the urinary tract. Another cause is urinary retention, caused by an enlarged prostate, bladder or kidney stones , causing a urinary tract infection that then spreads to the prostate. Factors that put individuals at risk of prostatitis, other than UTIs, include prostate surgery or any complications of prostate surgery, catheterisation (using a thin, flexible tube called a catheter to drain urine from the bladder, e.g. when healing after surgery), and infections spreading from other parts of the body. For prostatitis to be considered chronic, symptoms have to recur for at least three months. Recurrence is possible because the prostate can harbor infection. Symptoms can come and go. Chronic prostatitis tends not to cause fevers. Acute prostatitis is caused by infection and manifests with chills, fever and muscle pain, in addition to the multitude of urinary symptoms mentioned above, often along with cloudy-appearing urine. It often causes intense/severe abdominal and/or pelvic pain. It is relatively rare compared to chronic prostatitis, but must be treated promptly. Complications can include developing a prostate abscess and also urinary retention, where the patient is unable to pass urine due to pain, and which requires catheterisation. A prostate abscess requires surgical intervention. 8 Nonbacterial prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome can cause persistent discomfort and/or pain in the lower pelvic region, mainly around the anus and the base of the penis. The causes of CPPS are not well understood and may involve autoimmune responses, nerve problems, inflammation, or another, yet unidentified cause. In asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis, there are no symptoms. The condition is usually diagnosed in the course of a prostate examination for other conditions or as part of a urologic routine check-up. It can cause elevated PSA-values - this is an enzyme produced by the prostate, often looked at during routine urologic check-ups of men over 50 and which can be detected in the blood. Prostatitis is not a sexually-transmitted infection, although it can be caused by one. Prostatitis itself cannot be passed on via sexual activity, but sexually-transmitted infections that cause prostatitis can be. Prostatitis is not prostate cancer, and there is currently no evidence to suggest that getting prostatitis increases the risk of prostate cancer. 8\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is a common problem affecting men over the age of 40. By the time men turn 50 or older, an average of 40 percent have BPH to some degree. In BPH, the transition zone of the prostate enlarges, constricting the urethra, hindering, in some cases, the bladder’s ability to empty by throttling the flow of urine, which would normally move through the urethra and out of the bladder. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is not cancer, but it can affect a person’s quality of life due to the urinary problems it causes, especially the increased need to urinate at night, which disrupts sleep. If left untreated, BPH can cause complications such as kidney damage, urinary retention (the bladder not fully emptying anymore), bladder or kidney stones and urinary tract infections (UTIs), all due to disrupted urination. As it is largely an age-related disorder, BPH can worsen as it progresses if left unaddressed.\n\nThis is the second most common kind of cancer affecting men, after skin cancer. Men who are at particular risk are: Men older than 50 years of age Men with a family history of prostate cancer Men affected by obesity and/or who consume a diet high in animal fat Men of African descent, e.g. African-American men Prostate cancer can remain in the prostate and spread to closely located surrounding areas/tissues of the body - this is known as locally advanced prostate cancer; or it may spread to other parts of the body - this is known as advanced prostate cancer or metastatic prostate cancer. Prostate cancer has a good survival rate. This is because it progresses slowly and may be found and treated before it has a chance to spread too far and become life-limiting.",
    "diagnosis": "In order to establish the possible underlying causes for an enlarged prostate, doctors will perform a variety of tests. Tests which are commonly used to find the cause of an enlarged prostate include: A digital rectal exam. A physician or nurse will insert a gloved finger into the patient’s rectum to digitally examine the prostate for swelling and/or enlargement. Swab tests for urethral discharge or urine. To determine underlying conditions such as STIs/STDs (sexually transmitted infections/diseases) and urinary tract infections. A swab of discharge or urine is taken and sent to a medical laboratory for culturing, so that any microorganisms are identified. Urinalysis. A urine sample is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis and may be tested for urea nitrogen or creatinine, among other things. Blood tests. A sample of blood is sent to a medical laboratory for analysis, which may include tests for creatinine or blood urea nitrogen, as well as antibodies and infectious agents. Prostate-specific antigen test. A blood sample is sent to a medical laboratory to be tested for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme produced by cells in the prostate. A change in PSA levels can indicate that there is a problem with the prostate. If patients are referred to a urologist, they may have further tests, including: Ultrasounds to check the kidneys, the amount of urine left in bladder and the prostate itself. Urine flow studies, which involve urinating into a specialised device that measures the speed/rate of urine flow. A flow that is slower than normal may indicate an enlarged prostate. A cystoscopy, in which a tiny camera is threaded up the urethra at the end of the very thin, flexible tube. This can pick up damage, inflammation or changes in the bladder and is usually done if there are symptoms such as blood in the urine, painful urination, or a urinary tract infection. Bladder pressure (urodynamic) tests, in which tube sensors are placed in the bladder and sometimes also the rectum to measure pressure in the urethra, bladder and possibly rectum. An enlarged prostate can cause pressure in any of those places to increase, because it presses on the bladder and rectum. The International Prostate Symptom Score, a questionnaire formulated to determine the severity and duration of prostate symptoms. Before referring the patient for tests, the physician may also ask questions in order to determine the possible causes of the discomfort, their severity, and their duration. Such questions may cover: Medications used, prescribed and over-the-counter medication Other medical conditions, such as diabetes Medical conditions in other family members Lifestyle and diet Existing symptoms: their duration, whether they are getting worse and how they are affecting quality of life.",
    "enlarged_prostate_treatment": "Treatment for an enlarged prostate will depend on the condition which has caused the prostate to enlarge. No one treatment is best for every patient, and there are a number of treatment options available. Some may be as minor as lifestyle changes, and others may involve a hospital stay and surgery.\n\nTreatment for prostatitis includes: Antibiotics to kill the infectious agent Alpha-blockers, which relax the muscles near the prostate and relieve pressure on the urethra Other medications, such as finasteride or quercetin Muscle relaxants Painkillers to manage general discomfort/pain Laxatives to manage bowel discomfort caused by constipation In rare cases, prostatectomy (prostate surgery) may be necessary. Read more about Prostatectomy »\n\nTreatment for benign prostate hyperplasia can involve: 10 11 Lifestyle changes, such as limiting a night-time consumption of liquids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, avoiding medication such as diuretics, decongestants and antihistamines and getting more exercise, as well as dietary improvements, such as eating more fibre, avoiding artificial sweeteners and sweetened beverages. Medication, such as alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. Interventions, such as the Urolift](https://urolift.com/urolift-system/)® system, a non-surgical proprietary device that uses tiny implants to lift the prostate away from the urethra and thereby relieve BPH symptoms that result from pressure on the urethra. 12 Surgical procedures, such as a prostatectomy (removal of the prostate), transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) (using heat/microwaves), 13 14 prostate laser, and Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP). Herbal prostate treatments, such as saw palmetto extract. Saw palmetto extract is made from the fruit of the saw palmetto, which is native to the southeast and Gulf coasts of North America and may potentially assist in reducing urinary frequency and increasing urinary flow.\n\nTreatment of prostate cancer can involve: 15 16 17 18 Prostatectomy. The surgical removal of all or part of the prostate gland, which can be done as open surgery or laparoscopically (keyhole surgery). There are several different types of prostatectomy. External beam radiotherapy. This involves x-ray beams, which are focused on the prostate to destroy cancer cells. This is a non-surgical option. Permanent seed brachytherapy. This involves implanting small radioactive pellets into the prostate gland to destroy cancer cells. Hormone therapy. This may be used instead of radiation therapy or if the cancer has spread too far to be susceptible to prostatectomy or radiation treatment; it involves orchiectomy (surgical castration) and/or various treatments to lower androgen levels (chemical castration). 19 Cryotherapy. This is an option for cases where the cancer is still within the prostate or is locally advanced. It is non-invasive and involves the insertion of cryotherapy needles into the prostate, through which a certain gas is then passed in order to freeze the tissue and thereby also ideally killing the cancer cells. 20 Focused ultrasound therapy. This is a non-invasive method of treating prostate cancer using focused beams of ultrasound energy to heat and destroy cancer locations in the prostate. 21",
    "enlarged_prostate_faqs": "Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my sexual function? A: Whether or not an enlarged prostate affects sexual function depends on the underlying cause. Prostatitis can cause erectile dysfunction because of pain. 22 It can also result in painful ejaculation, which can lead to problems with sexual pleasure and indirectly cause problems with sexual function. 23 This is likely to be temporary, and matters will improve along with the condition. Benign prostatic hyperplasia itself does not cause erectile dysfunction, but some treatments for it, for example the drug finasteride, can. However, there are other drugs available, such as terazosin, tamsulosin and doxazosin, that are less likely to cause this side effect. Likewise, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) can cause erectile dysfunction in some men. Prostate cancer can cause problems such as erectile dysfunction, and if there is a sudden onset of such problems where no problems have existed before, a physician should be consulted. Some treatments for prostate cancer can affect sexual performance, e.g. by causing erectile dysfunction, due to the side-effects of hormone therapy, damage to erectile tissue resulting from radiation or brachytherapy or severed nerves and muscles after prostate surgery. Q: Can an enlarged prostate affect my fertility? A: Prostate problems, such as those resulting from pain and prostate cancer treatments, can lead to problems with getting and maintaining an erection and with ejaculation, which then affects successful conception. However, any very enlarged prostate may also cause problems with sperm transport. If the prostate is enlarged, it can press on the ejaculatory ducts and prevent the adequate formulation of semen. Treatments for prostate cancer, especially radiation treatment and hormone treatment, can affect male fertility, owing to their effects on sperm production. Prostatectomy, when it involves the removal of the entire prostate and seminal vesicles, can render men unable to ejaculate. Radiation treatment causes a decline in sperm production and/or sperm quality, and the same is true of many chemotherapy treatments. Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) can affect sperm motility, i.e. the way sperms move around, and fertility problems might result. Inflammation of the prostate can also cause bladder problems that lead to retrograde ejaculation, which is when semen enters the bladder rather than leaving the body."

    "condition": "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/epstein-barr-virus/",
    "what_is_epstein_barr_virus_infection": "The Epstein-Barr virus is a common virus that infects only humans . It can cause a condition known as infectious mononucleosis , mono or glandular fever. The Epstein-Barr virus is a member of the human herpesvirus family and is also known as human herpesvirus 4 or HHV-4. It is estimated that up to 90 percent of the world’s adult population has the Epstein-Barr virus, but many people who have the virus in their bodies will experience no symptoms. Many people are infected during childhood or adolescence. In the U.S., about half of the population has contracted EBV by the age of five. Most of the remainder contract the virus during adolescence or early adulthood. 1 People who contract the virus during childhood tend not to show symptoms of infection, but those who contract it during adolescence or adulthood may develop infectious mononucleosis. 2 The symptoms of EBV-related mononucleosis are a severe sore throat, fever, and intense fatigue that can last for several months. Once the initial infection has ended, the virus remains latent in the body. 3 Treatment for infectious mononucleosis, which is normally caused by EBV, includes treating the symptoms and monitoring for complications. The outlook for people with infectious mononucleosis is generally good.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Most people contract the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, during childhood and may not show symptoms during that time . Children may show only very mild or non-specific symptoms of infection, but the condition tends to affect teenagers and adults more severely. 3 The condition is most common among people between the ages of 15 and 24.  Signs of infection usually develop only some time after the virus has been contracted; this incubation period is usually between a month and eight weeks long. 4 The most common symptoms of infectious mononucleosis are: 1 3 5 6 7 Fatigue Fever, but not always chills; the fever caused by an EBV infection is typically low-grade Swollen lymph glands, also known as lymphadenopathy A sore throat, also known as pharyngitis Nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite Enlarged tonsils Headaches The sore throat, which is one of the most prominent symptoms of glandular fever, can sometimes be confused with strep throat . It is common for people who have EBV-related pharyngitis to have painful, enlarged tonsils, also. 1\n\nOther symptoms include: 1 3 5 6 7 Body aches Enlarged spleen Enlarged liver Non-itchy skin rash Jaundice Less common symptoms include: 1 Coughing Eye pain Chest pain Sensitivity to light Muscle pain Although not everyone who is affected by infectious mononucleosis experiences an enlarged spleen and/or liver, these can nevertheless be very serious symptoms. In some cases, the spleen may rupture. 7 A ruptured spleen can in fact sometimes be the first sign that someone has infectious mononucleosis. Signs and symptoms of a ruptured spleen include: 8 Pain in the stomach, often worse on the upper left side Pain in the left shoulder Muscle-guarding in the abdomen, i.e., tensing the abdominal muscles Rapid heartbeat Low blood pressure Nausea Sweating Lightheadedness and/or fainting Fatigue Blurred vision Bruising or bloating of the stomach region The pain from a ruptured spleen can be mild or severe. A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, and the affected person should go to the hospital immediately. The rash associated with infectious mononucleosis is faint, red, and not itchy; it typically disappears quickly. 1 Jaundice is more common among older people affected by infectious mononucleosis; older people may also not always have a sore throat or swollen lymph glands.",
    "what_causes_epstein_barr_virus": "The Epstein-Barr virus is extremely contagious , and new infections are especially common in populations of high-school and college-age adults. 5 It is spread by contact with infectious bodily fluids, especially saliva, and is therefore sometimes known as the kissing disease . It can also be spread by: Sharing toothbrushes Sharing drinking vessels and cutlery, especially if they are not washed between use Coughing and sneezing Contact with the saliva, blood, or semen of someone with EBV Organ transplants or blood transfusions from a donor with EBV Young children may also contract the virus from putting toys into their mouths that have been in contact with the infected saliva of other children or from the hands of caregivers with infected saliva on them. 9 Teenagers and adults can contract EBV by kissing someone who is shedding the virus. People who have the virus in their bodies can pass it on to others, even when they themselves are not experiencing any symptoms. The incubation period between getting the virus and developing symptoms is also quite long, up to eight weeks. For these reasons, it is sometimes hard to diagnose mono, as the affected person may not remember being near anyone ill and may not have known that they were in contact with someone who was shedding the virus.",
    "epstein_barr_virus_diagnosis": "While infectious mononucleosis is usually diagnosed by a physical examination and consideration of the symptoms shown by the affected person, 6 laboratory tests can also be used to confirm an Epstein-Barr virus infection as well as infectious mononucleosis. Tests that can be done include: 6 10 Complete blood counts Heterophile antibody/monospot tests Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests EBV-specific blood tests The complete blood count results give information on the immune response that the body is mounting against the EBV virus, as well as whether unusual white blood cells typical of EBV infection are present. The test most commonly used to diagnose an EBV infection is known as a heterophile antibody test, which is usually accompanied by a complete blood count (CBC). This test, also known as a monospot test, looks for the antibodies the body produces to fight off EBV itself. 10 This is usually the first test done. However, this test can take up to two weeks to become positive, meaning that people in the early stages of the condition may test negative. ref1 In the event of an initial negative test, these monospot tests can be carried out weekly for six weeks if the initial tests come back negative; after six weeks, however, a specific EBV serological test should be done. ref1 In some cases, especially in the case of a child with suspected mono, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test may be done; this tests for the DNA of EBV viruses. It is more sensitive but also more expensive. A PCR test can also be used to diagnose indeterminate EBV infections. 1 All of these tests are done on blood samples from the affected person. The blood test results of someone with infectious mononucleosis may show: 6 More white blood cells than usual Unusual-looking white blood cells A lower number of platelets than would be usual Signs of abnormal liver function If these tests are inconclusive, a test specifically designed to test for Epstein-Barr viruses may be ordered. These tests are very specific and are designed to determine whether the person being tested has EBV and whether they have infectious mononucleosis. They are typically only done if other tests do not prove or disprove that EBV infection is present, as they are quite expensive and require specialized staff to interpret the results. 11 No known tests for infectious mononucleosis or EBV can tell from whom the infection was contracted.",
    "treatments_for_epstein_barr_virus_infection": "Most cases of EBV infection are asymptomatic and therefore, do not require treatment. Treatment for infectious mononucleosis centers around relieving the symptoms. Medications such as aciclovir have not been shown to be effective against glandular fever. 1 People with infectious mononucleosis should: 1 12 Be careful to stay well-hydrated and well-nourished Manage pain and discomfort using over-the-counter acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, or ibuprofen Gargle with salt water and/or suck lozenges to relieve throat pain Take bed rest and avoid doing anything strenuous 6\n\nMost people with infectious mononucleosis recover within two to four weeks, but the fatigue that is characteristic of the condition may last for longer. Rarely, symptoms may persist for up to six months. 6 After glandular fever, it is very important to avoid contact sports, heavy lifting or rough activity until given the all-clear by a physician. The spleen and liver can stay enlarged for some time after the sore throat and fever are gone, so the risk of rupturing them remains higher than usual. Once they have gone back to normal size, the affected person can resume their sports or exercise regime.\n\nAlthough most cases of infectious mononucleosis resolve without complications, they can occur. Severe complications include meningoencephalitis, splenic rupture and extreme tonsillar enlargement; less severe complications include sinus infections or tonsillitis . It is quite rare for severe complications to occur. f they do, because of their potential severity, they should be considered medical emergencies and promptly treated.\n\nThe Epstein-Barr virus seldom affects the nervous system. Neurological involvement is more likely to occur among children than adults but is exceedingly rare in both groups. 13 In rare cases, EBV can lead to swelling of the meningeal membranes and brain. Signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis include: Headache Confusion and/or disorientation Difficulty thinking clearly Unusual clumsiness or lack of coordination Unusual or out-of-character behaviour Fever Light sensitivity Stiffness of the neck Painful neck It is very important that anyone showing these symptoms receives prompt medical care. This condition can be fatal if it is not treated. In severe cases, people who recover may have long-term problems. 13\n\nAlthough an enlarged spleen is common among people affected by glandular fever, actual rupture of the spleen is rare. 14 However, because the other symptoms of infectious mononucleosis can be mild or vague, it can happen that a ruptured spleen is the first sign that someone has the condition. The pain from a ruptured spleen can differ, varying between mild and severe. A ruptured spleen is a medical emergency, and the affected person should go to the hospital immediately. For more information on the symptoms of a ruptured spleen, see the symptoms section.\n\nEnlarged tonsils, also known as tonsillitis , often accompany the painful sore throat that is characteristic of infectious mononucleosis. In rare cases, the tonsils may become so enlarged that they touch one another, partially or almost completely blocking the airway. This can happen with or without a secondary bacterial throat infection and may appear in cases where other severe symptoms of infectious mononucleosis are absent. 15 However, in cases of very enlarged tonsils, lymph nodes in the area are usually also quite enlarged. 16 People with mono should be aware that this complication may occur and seek medical treatment at once if they begin to breathe with difficulty.",
    "prevention": "There is no vaccine for Epstein-Barr virus infection. The main ways of preventing Epstein-Barr virus infection are to avoid sharing toothbrushes, cups, and other items that may come into contact with saliva or other bodily fluids with anyone who has had infectious mononucleosis. It is always a good idea to cover the mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing and to wash one’s hands after doing so and after using the bathroom.",
    "other_names_for_epstein_barr_virus": "Infectious mononucleosis Glandular fever",
    "epstein_barr_virus_infection_faqs": "Q: Does Epstein-Barr virus cause paralysis? A: Rarely, an Epstein-Barr virus infection can cause a condition in which one side of the face can become temporarily weak or paralyzed. This is caused by inflammation of a branch of the facial nerve; inflammation disrupts the nerve signals, and weakness or paralysis affects the facial muscles. People affected by this condition usually recover within six to 12 weeks. Other infections that can cause a similar disorder, known as Bell’s palsy, include infection with the herpes simplex virus , the flu , middle ear infections , and Lyme disease , as well as chronic conditions such as diabetes , sarcoidosis and high blood pressure . When facial paralysis is caused by Epstein-Barr or herpes zoster infection , it is not called Bell’s palsy, although the symptoms are identical. Epstein-Barr virus may also be a potential cause of Guillain-Barre syndrome, although this is not known for certain, and the exact causes of Guillain-Barre symptoms are as yet unknown. Guillain-Barre syndrome is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system attacks the nerves, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. In most cases, the condition is temporary, and the majority of people affected recover well. 17 Q: Does Epstein-Barr virus cause chronic fatigue syndrome? A: No conclusive link has as yet been found between Epstein-Barr virus infection and chronic fatigue syndrome, although the condition is still being researched. 18 Some studies have shown that some people with CFS have a history of EBV infection, but others do not. 19 Other potential triggers for chronic fatigue syndrome are environmental factors, hormonal imbalances, other viral infections – such as cytomegalovirus infection and rubella , among others – and problems with the immune system. 18 19 Q: Does Epstein-Barr virus infection cause a rash? A: Epstein-Barr virus infection causes a rash only rarely. Sometimes, this is the result of the infection itself. However, in most cases, a rash that affects someone with EBV is the result of attempts to treat the disorder with antibiotics, specifically ampicillin and amoxicillin. 20 21 Developing this rash after being given a penicillin-type antibiotic does not mean that the person is allergic to those antibiotics. Because infectious mononucleosis is a viral condition, antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. Unlike the rash caused by EBV itself, the rash associated with antibiotic use in cases of EBV is itchy, red, and can be long-lasting. 1 22 Q: Can Epstein-Barr virus infection be fatal? A: Epstein-Barr virus infection can be fatal, but this is very rare. In some cases of EBV infection, a rare complication is that the spleen may enlarge and rupture. 22 If the ruptured spleen is not treated as a medical emergency, the affected person may become very seriously ill. In other cases, the infection may lead to hepatitis and subsequently liver failure, although this is also very rare. 23 24 Q: Can Epstein-Barr virus cause cancer? A: Epstein-Barr virus is thought to be related to several types of cancer: Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, some kinds of stomach cancer, and some kinds of nasopharyngeal cancer . 25 It may also be involved in the development of various other cancers, including breast and prostate cancer . However, investigations into the relationship between cancer and EBV are still ongoing, and it is likely that various factors, not EBV infection alone, are involved in the development of such cancers. 26 Overall, only a tiny minority of people affected with EBV will ever develop cancer as a result of the virus. 27 Q: What is lymphoma, and how does it relate to EBV infection? A: Lymphoma is a form of cancer that affects the body’s lymphatic system, the network of ducts that drain lymph from the tissues into the blood. The lymphatic system is part of the body’s immune system. 28 Lymphoma occurs when lymphocytes, which circulate in the lymphatic system, do not behave normally. In lymphoma, abnormal lymphocytes gather in the lymph nodes. There are two types of lymphocytes, commonly known as B cells and T cells. Lymphoma has two main subtypes, Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and is most common among people of African descent. 29 Most cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma start in the B cells. Epstein-Barr virus infects the B cells, but in most people, this does not cause further problems. 30 In some people, however, the EBV infection causes the B cells to begin to multiply abnormally, causing lymphoma."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/erectile-dysfunction/",
    "what_is_erectile_dysfunction": "Erectile dysfunction, otherwise known as ED or impotence, is the condition of being unable to get or maintain an erection suitable for satisfactory sexual intercourse. 1 It is a common condition that most males will experience at some stage in their life, though it is most prevalent in older men. ED is almost always manageable , although it can be recurring, depending on whether the cause is short-term and treatable, or ongoing. 1 The possible causes of Erectile Disfunction are numerous. Physical causes include aging, high blood pressure, conditions which affect the blood vessels and/or nerves associated with the penis, and nerve damage to the area which occurs due to injuries, or certain surgeries such as prostate surgery. Psychological causes of ED include depression, anxiety and relationship issues. In most cases, erectile dysfunction can be successfully managed, with treatment options depending on the root cause of the disorder. 1 Treatment may involve forms of sex therapy and counseling, exercises and lifestyle changes, Erectile disfunction pills and topical medications, pumps and - in severe cases ‒ prosthetics. If you think you might have Erectile Dysfunction, try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of erectile dysfunction may include: An inability to get an erection An inability to maintain an erection during sexual activity These symptoms may come and go over time or be situational, for example not present during masturbation but present with a partner. 1 If symptoms occur regularly or semi-regularly, visiting a doctor is advised. The onset of ED may be different, depending on whether it is caused by physical or psychological factors: If the causes of erectile dysfunction are physical in origin, the condition is more likely to appear gradually, with the problem occurring intermittently before becoming more frequent. A person’s sex drive is unlikely to be affected, unless the root cause is hormonal in nature. Psychological causes typically result in the sudden onset of the condition. If a person is able to get and maintain a healthy erection sometimes, for example when masturbating or on waking, it may be a sign that their erectile dysfunction is psychological in origin. If you are affected by unexplained ED, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app .",
    "causes": "Finding a treatment approach that can cure erectile dysfunction usually depends on identifying its root cause. Erectile dysfunction can be caused by a variety of physical and psychological factors: 1\n\nMost cases of erectile dysfunction are caused by physical factors. The most common cause for erectile dysfunction is reduced blood flow to the penis. This happens as a result of a narrowing of the arteries in the penis. Conditions which can lead to the development of erectile dysfunction include: 2 Diabetes , which can affect the function of the blood vessels and nerves Parkinson’s disease , either as a side-effect of medication or due to the condition itself Multiple sclerosis , a condition associated with progressive damage of the nerves, including those associated with getting and maintaining erections Stroke Other factors which are recognised as physical causes of erectile dysfunction include: Excessive intake of alcohol or drugs, which can impair the ability to get or maintain an erection. Medications which cause ED as a side-effect, such as certain kinds of antidepressants, beta blockers and some diuretics A lack of certain hormones, particularly testosterone . (ED caused by hormone deficiencies is uncommon.) Damage to the nerves in the penis as a result of surgery to nearby areas, such as prostate surgery, or from an injury, such as a spinal cord injury\n\nProstate surgery procedures can directly disrupt the nerves and blood vessels that control the way erections form. 3 For this reason, all prostatectomies will compromise erectile function, at least initially. Up to 50 percent of men who have had a successful nerve-sparing procedure, i.e. the nerves were left untouched as planned during the procedure, regain their pre-prostatectomy erectile functionality during recovery, within one year. For men who have not had nerve-sparing procedures, it is usually still possible to recover most or the entire extent of their pre-treatment erectile capability. In cases where spontaneous erections are no longer possible, there are several possible treatment options which may help with overcoming erectile dysfunction after a prostatectomy. These include: Oral medications (e.g. Viagra®) Topical medications (e.g. Vitaros©) Vacuum pumps Implants All of these medications work by increasing blood flow to the penis, causing an erection . (For more information about Erectile Dysfunction treatment after having prostatectomy, see treatment.)\n\nA range of mental health issues can lead to the development of Erectile Dysfunction, including: Depression Stress/pressure Anxiety Relationship issues Purely psychological causes for Erectile Dysfunction are less common, limited to approximately 10 percent of cases. 1",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_erectile_dysfunction": "Risk factors for Erectile Dysfunction include: Aging ‒ ED is more common among middle-aged and older men High blood pressure High cholesterol Smoking Injuries to the groin Surgery (such as prostatectomy).",
    "diagnosis": "The first step in treating ED is getting a diagnosis of the root cause by visiting a doctor. They may ask typical questions regarding: 4 The symptoms experienced The duration of symptoms General physical and mental health Levels of alcohol and drug intake Whether any other medication is also being taken It may also be necessary for a person to answer questions about their sexual history. These may include: Details of current and past sexual relationships Information about sexual orientation Whether the dysfunction occurs all the time, intermittently or only in certain situations Whether ejaculation is possible Libido (level of sexual desire) A doctor will perform a thorough physical examination to rule out any physical causes of ED. As narrowed blood vessels are the most common cause of Erectile Disfuntion, the doctor will usually examine a person’s cardiovascular condition as part of the diagnosis. This may involve testing for high blood pressure, checking for heart irregularities, as well as evaluating their weight and overall level of health. Blood tests may also be ordered to check for underlying medical conditions that may be causing the condition.",
    "treatment_options_for_erectile_dysfunction": "In most cases, doctors will be able to suggest and prescribe treatment options. A person may also be referred to a specialist. Treatment methods will depend on the underlying cause of the problem, meaning the chosen method will differ from case to case. Common treatment options for Erectile Dysfunction include:\n\nIf an underlying condition is causing Erectile Dysfunction, treating it will generally be the first step towards resolving ED. If medications used to treat other conditions are thought to be causing erectile dysfunction, a doctor may be able to prescribe alternatives. 2 Good to know: Use of prescribed medication should never be discontinued without supervision by a doctor.\n\nA range of lifestyle changes can help treat erectile dysfunction, including: Losing weight Reducing stress Quitting smoking Reducing alcohol and drug intake or giving them up completely Getting regular exercise\n\nIf stress, anxiety or depression are causing Erectile Dysfunction, counseling may be an effective treatment. If relationship issues are the cause, sex therapy or relationship counseling may prove successful. In sex therapy, every session is confidential. You can attend on your own, however if your partner is affected, it is likely to be beneficial for both of you to attend. This form of therapy may lead to a better understanding of what you are experiencing, you may receive tasks and exercises to practice with your partner in your own time. Relationship counseling, in which partners are prompted to explore the physical and psychological issues behind their sexual problems, may also be an effective method of overcoming Erectile Dysfunction. Partners are encouraged to become more aware of each other’s needs, allowing them to reach a solution which works for them both.\n\nOral medications which are used to treat erectile dysfunction come in the form of tablets or pills. The drugs most commonly used to treat ED are called phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors.\n\nThese medications work by counteracting phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), a chemical naturally occurring in the body, thereby increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. PDE-5 inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed medication for treating erectile dysfunction. The most common types are: Sildenafil: (Viagra®) Tadalafil: (Cialis®) Vardenafil: (Levitra®) Avanafil: (Spedra®) These medications work by artificially dilating the blood vessels in the penis, enabling improved blood flow. The effects of tadalafil can last for up to 36 hours, while the other three options generally last for around 10 hours. Each should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before engaging in sexual activity and will only take effect when one is sexually excited. 2 A doctor will be able to advise about which type of PDE-5 is most suitable for each person and the health risks and side effects that come with them. Common side effects of PDE-5 inhibitors can include: Back pain Indigestion Migraine Muscle pain Blocked nose Nausea Vomiting Rarely, in some cases, patients using PDE-5 inhibitors can experience severe vision problems: a temporary or permanent blindness which may be a sign of non–arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Although this can be seen in patients who are using PDE-5 inhibitors, there is insufficient evidence to support a direct link to the development of NAION.\n\nAn efficient medication for assisting erectile function is thought to be alprostadil, a man-made version of prostaglandin E1, a substance naturally made in the body to help produce erections. Generally, due to the fact that it is a relatively new treatment with limited safety data, alprostadil will only be prescribed if other treatments, including counseling, lifestyle changes and PDE-5 inhibitors, have been ineffective or are unsuitable. It is administered in three main forms: 5 As an injection, directly into the base of the penis As a small pellet, which is placed into the urethra (the opening on the tip of the penis) As a topical cream, applied to the urethra Doctors will advise on which form of alprostadil should be used and give instructions on how to properly administer it at home. After application, an erection can usually be achieved in around 15 minutes.\n\nAlprostadil has significantly fewer and less severe side effects than most oral medications which can be used to treat erectile dysfunction. It works by widening the blood vessels and increasing the blood flow to the penis, causing an erection. If side effects occur, these are usually non-serious and are limited to prolonged erections, pain and dizziness. 5 Another advantage of Alprostadil is that the dosage can be adjusted to determine the duration of an erection.\n\nA commonly prescribed topical medication for ED is Vitaros©, a prescription medicine in the form of a cream, containing the active ingredient alprostadil. This is the newest form of alprostadil. 5 Vitaros comes in a single-use container with a plunger, barrel and protective cap, containing either 200 or 300 micrograms of alprostadil in 100 mg of cream. 5 The appropriate dose strength for each person is decided in consultation with their doctor.\n\nVacuum pumps can relieve the symptoms of erectile dysfunction. A specialized mechanical pump is used to cause an erection by placing it over the penis and sucking air out of the pump, drawing blood into the penis. Erections created with the use of a vacuum device require a band to be applied to the base of the penis to trap the blood for the duration of the intercouse. The band can then be removed afterwards. For safety reasons, the rubber band should be removed within 30 minutes.\n\nPenile prosthesis is a surgical procedure in which a rod is implanted inside the penis in order to simulate an erection. Advanced procedures involve the insertion of an inflatable rod. **This treatment method for ED can be considered when other conservative approaches are ineffective.",
    "erectile_dysfunction_prevention": "Though it may not always be possible to prevent erectile dysfunction, certain steps can be taken to reduce the risk of the condition. These include: 6 Staying healthy, with regular exercise and a balanced diet, Stopping smoking Avoiding drugs and excessive amounts of alcohol Seeking treatment for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes",
    "complications_associated_with_erectile_dysfunction": "There are no serious physical complications associated with erectile dysfunction.However, the condition can negatively affect a person’s mental health, causing issues such as: Stress and anxiety Low self-esteem Embarrassment An unsatisfactory sex life Problems within a relationship",
    "erectile_dysfunction_faqs": "Q: What is the main cause of Erectile Dysfunction? A: The root cause of ED is insufficient blood flow to the penis, which makes it difficult to get or maintain an erection. This can be due to a great variety of different physical and psychological reasons. Q: What can cause young people to be affected by Erectile Dysfunction? A: Unless it occurs due to a medical condition or structural damage to the nerves from surgery or injury, ED in young men is likely to be from psychological causes such as anxiety, depression and stress. Q: Is there a permanent cure for Erectile Dysfunction? A: Although there is no guaranteed cure for Erectile Dysfunction, there are a number of treatment options that can provide long-term relief. Doctors can help advise on the best treatment methods. Q: Are there any home remedies or natural products that can be used to prevent or treat Erectile Dysfunction? A: Seeking medical advice before using any home remedy is advised. Natural products are not recommended treatments for ED, because they are insufficiently scientifically researched for their effectiveness to be proven, and furthermore may be harmful in some cases. However, a doctor should always be consulted before using natural products, particularly in conjunction with other medications to avoid cross-reactivity. What pills are available to help treat Erectile Dysfunction? A: Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are the most common pill-form drugs that are used to treat erectile dysfunction. Types include: Sildenafil (Viagra®), Tadalafil (Cialis®), Vardenafil (Levitra®) and Avanafil (Spedra®). A doctor should be consulted before using any of these pills as they may be unsuitable in some cases and/or cause intolerable side-effects. Q: Does masturbating cause ED? A: No, it is a myth that masturbating itself, even excessively, can cause ED. In fact, after a prostatectomy, a person is actively encouraged by their doctor to resume their sexual practices, including masturbation, as normal in order to restore sexual function. Q: Does porn cause ED? A: Porn-induced erectile dysfunction is a concept which was first identified by the Kinsey Institute in 2007, soon after internet-based pornography became a worldwide phenomenon. Research suggests a correlation between becoming addicted to watching porn and developing forms of sexual dysfunction, including ED. However, the full relationship between watching porn and developing ED is not yet fully understood."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/esophageal-cancer/",
    "what_is_esophageal_cancer": "Esophageal cancer is a cancer which arises from the esophagus (the long tube that carries the food from the mouth through the throat to the stomach). Esophageal cancer doesn’t usually cause any symptoms in the early stages. However, difficulty swallowing food, a heartburn, vomiting up blood, cough, and an undesired weight loss are some of the main symptoms when the tumor gets bigger. A history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), smoking and excessive alcohol intake increases the risk of esophageal cancer. Treatment usually involves surgery as well as radiotherapy or medication (chemotherapy).",
    "risks": "Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollable. These cells tend to destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread into other parts of the body. Males are more commonly affected than females. This condition is most common in adults older than 60. People with long-standing gastroesophageal reflux disease may be at increased risk of developing this condition. Other factors which increase the likelihood of developing  esophageal cancer include drinking alcohol, smoking and being obese. People who both smoke and drink heavily are at even higher risk of developing this condition.",
    "esophageal_cancer_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms in patients being treated for esophageal cancer. This is because cancer therapy weakens the immune system, which puts you at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Taking the necessary precautions and getting tested as soon as possible is crucial if you start experiencing symptoms. Talk to your doctor to determine whether you're eligible for antiviral medication .",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of esophageal cancer include: difficulty swallowing (some people feel food sticking in their chest) regurgitating undigested food reflux heartburn hoarseness coughing when eating or drinking Later symptoms may include: weight loss, chest pain and vomiting blood. Esophageal cancer is often symptomless in the early stages of the disease, and has been known to cause mild symptoms which may be mistaken for other illnesses.",
    "diagnosis": "A diagnosis is made based upon the symptoms, a physical examination and a test called endoscopy (in which a small flexible camera is inserted into the body through the mouth to look at the esophagus and stomach). If anything abnormal is seen, a sample of the esophagus can be taken (a biopsy) to investigate for cancer. Scans, such as a CT (computed tomography) are often needed to determine the size, location and developmental stage of the esophageal cancer.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of esophageal cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, esophageal cancer can be treated by radiotherapy, surgical removal of some or all of the esophagus, and chemotherapy or a combination of therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment. Counseling or involvement in a support group may be helpful to the patient in coming to terms with their diagnosis.",
    "prevention": "Gastroesophageal reflux should be treated effectively and monitored for signs of developing esophageal cancer. Losing weight, reducing alcohol intake and quitting smoking may all help to prevent esophageal cancer.",

    "condition": "Essential Hypertension",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/essential-hypertension/",
    "what_is_essential_hypertension": "Essential hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that has no clearly identifiable cause, but is thought to be linked to genetics, poor diet, lack of exercise and obesity. It is by far the most common form of high blood pressure, affecting the majority of those who experience hypertension. It is also known as primary hypertension. 1\n\nAs the heart pumps blood through the circulatory system, blood presses against the artery walls. High blood pressure occurs when the walls of the arteries exert a stronger oppositional force, which requires the heart to work harder in order to move blood through the body. This results in an increase in the pressure of blood in the arteries. There are a variety of methods for managing essential hypertension, including lifestyle changes and medication. If left untreated, the condition can lead to serious complications, including heart attack and heart failure. People concerned that they may have essential hypertension can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nWhereas essential hypertension is characterized by its lack of identifiable causes, secondary hypertension, another form of hypertension, is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine (related to hormones), heart and kidney conditions. It is far less common than essential hypertension. 2",
    "symptoms": "In most cases, there will be no apparent symptoms of essential hypertension, and it will only be discovered during a regular medical examination. If essential hypertension is not diagnosed, the condition has the potential to worsen and create heart or kidney problems. Sometimes, people with essential hypertension may experience headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision, but these symptoms are unlikely to occur until blood pressure reaches very high levels. Some people report that their heartbeat seems louder than usual and feels as if it is inside the ear; this may be more prominent the higher the blood pressure is. 3 People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to hypertension can use the free Ada app for a symptom assessment. If a person experiences vomiting or nausea, severe headaches , vision changes, or nosebleeds, it may be a sign of malignant hypertension – a much more dangerous type of high blood pressure. If these symptoms appear, urgent medical attention should be sought.",
    "causes": "Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of identifiable causes. However, certain risk factors that make the condition more likely have been identified. These include: 4\n\nObesity puts extra strain on the heart, increasing the risk of high blood pressure.\n\nThose with a family history of essential hypertension are more likely to be at risk of developing the condition themselves. Fifty genes have been identified as linked to high blood pressure.\n\nMultiple factors related to aging have been shown to increase the likelihood of essential hypertension. These include the stiffening of the arteries and the onset of certain renal microvascular diseases not yet perceived as a cause. 5\n\nIt is thought that long-term or chronic mental stress is linked to the development of essential hypertension. 6\n\nExcessive salt (sodium) consumption, defined by the American Heart Association as eating over 2300 mg per day, can play a role in the onset of essential hypertension. Salt increases retention of water in the body, which in turn increases the volume of blood and, consequently, blood pressure.\n\nThe enzyme renin, produced by the kidneys, is part of the body’s “renin angiotensin system”, which is responsible for controlling arterial blood pressure and is closely linked to both essential hypertension and hypertension in general. People with both low and high levels of renin are at risk of the condition.\n\nThe link between leading a sedentary lifestyle and an increased chance of essential hypersensitivity is well studied. To lead a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of high blood pressure, it is recommended that adults engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity five days a week. 7 8\n\nResearch indicates that hypertension is often more common in people of Afro-Caribbean descent. Hypertension also tends to occur earlier in life, be more severe and be associated with a higher risk of organ damage in people from this group.\n\nExcessive alcohol intake, defined by the U.S. Department of Health as consuming more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men, is associated with hypertension. Read more about Alcohol Intoxication »\n\nA lack of physical activity is associated with hypertension. Exercise is one of the key methods of managing high blood pressure.",
    "diagnosing_essential_hypertension": "Essential hypertension is diagnosed by taking blood pressure measurements using a blood pressure monitor, which is also called a sphygmomanometer or an aneroid device. 9 These tests are routinely carried out as part of a normal medical examination. Stress, anger, physical exercise and other factors can temporarily raise a person’s blood pressure, meaning a diagnosis of essential hypertension can only be made when results are consistently high. Multiple readings, including readings taken outside of the hospital or doctor’s office, should be taken. To do this, a doctor may ask people to measure their own blood pressure daily, at home or at a pharmacy. Blood pressure readings are expressed as two numbers, for example: 120/80. The first number is systolic pressure, which shows the amount of force being exerted on the artery walls as the heart pumps. The second number is diastolic pressure, which shows the amount of force being exerted on the artery walls between beats of the heart. A healthy systolic reading is 120 or lower. Between 120 and 139 is considered normal, but not optimum, and over 140 is hypertensive. A healthy diastolic reading is 80 or lower. Between 80 and 89 is considered normal, but not optimum, and over 90 is hypertensive. These values can be used as a general guide, but it should be noted that the thresholds for healthy and hypertensive blood pressure tend to differ between countries. People worried about their risk of hypertension should visit a doctor for testing. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "essential_hypertension_treatment": "Hypertension can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. Doctors may recommend a range of lifestyle adjustments that will commonly include: Adopting a healthy, nutritious diet, ideally vegetarian or vegan in nature Exercising Stress relief techniques Reducing alcohol and tobacco use Consuming less salt, cheese, bread and processed foods If lifestyle changes do not produce satisfactory results, a doctor may prescribe medication aimed at lowering blood pressure. These may include: Beta blockers Calcium channel blockers Diuretics Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Angiotensin II receptor blockers Renin inhibitors",
    "essential_hypertension_prognosis": "People diagnosed with essential hypertension generally stand a good chance of lowering their blood pressure through lifestyle changes, medication or a combination of the two. Lifestyle changes will normally need to be maintained for the rest of one’s life to ensure high blood pressure does not reoccur. Depending on the person, medications may need to be taken indefinitely. In some cases, the use of medication can be stopped after blood pressure has fallen, with these lower levels then maintained through lifestyle alterations.\n\nIf essential hypertension is left untreated, it can lead to a variety of potentially serious complications. The heart, arteries and vascular system can be damaged, leading to: Heart attack Heart failure Kidney damage Eye damage Atherosclerosis ; hardening of the arteries Stroke",
    "essential_hypertension_in_pregnancy": "Essential hypertension is a factor in approximately one percent of pregnancies . 10 To be classed as essential hypertension, the high blood pressure must be pre-existing and have no identifiable cause. Some women develop hypertension during pregnancy; this is a seperate condition called gestational high blood pressure. Typically, the blood pressure levels of women with essential hypertension during pregnancy will remain stable or fall in the early stages of pregnancy, before accelerating in around the second or third trimester. 10 Essential hypertension in pregnancy may cause complications including: 11 Preeclampsia Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) Placental abruption Premature birth Stillbirth Women with essential hypertension in pregnancy will have their blood pressure levels monitored regularly by their doctor or midwife. If levels become high, the urine will be checked for protein, and symptoms of preeclampsia will be checked for. If signs of preeclampsia are found, a specialist will be brought in for treatment. 12 If blood pressure levels are high but there are no signs of preeclampsia, treatment will depend on the severity of the hypertension and the risks posed to the pregnancy. To identify potential risks, ensure proper care is given and monitor the health of the baby. Women may be admitted to hospital to undergo blood tests, ultrasounds and other tests. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to lower blood pressure levels. 12",

    "essential_hypertension_faqs": "Q: Can essential hypertension be treated successfully? A: Yes, in many cases, there is a good chance that blood pressure can be lowered if the appropriate treatment methods are followed. To ensure blood pressure remains at a healthy level, most people will be required to maintain lifestyle changes and, if required, take medication, possibly for the rest of their lives. Q: What is malignant essential hypertension? A: Malignant essential hypertension, sometimes called accelerated hypertension, is a form of hypertensive emergency. It involves high blood pressure that develops very quickly, causing serious complications. The malignant variety is extremely rare, affecting roughly one percent of those with high blood pressure, but if it is suspected, it should be treated as a medical emergency. 13 Q: What is benign essential hypertension? A: When essential hypertension remains in its early stages for a prolonged period of time and without a specific known cause, it is known as benign essential hypertension. In this state, the condition will generally be symptomless and develop very slowly. It is still important to seek treatment after a diagnosis of benign essential hypertension. What is non-essential hypertension? A: Non-essential hypertension is an alternative name for secondary hypertension. Essential hypertension is characterized by a lack of clearly attributable causes, whereas secondary hypertension is directly linked to a variety of vascular, endocrine, heart and kidney conditions. Q: Can pregnancy cause essential hypertension? A: Essential hypertension is defined by its lack of a clearly attributable cause, meaning that pregnancy cannot be said to cause the condition. However, pregnancy can cause a form of hypertension known as gestational hypertension. By definition, this form of hypertension must occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy in a previously not hypertensive person and disappear after the delivery of the baby Longer lasting hypertension, detected either before pregnancy or before the 20th week of pregnancy, and which remains after delivery of the baby, is defined as chronic hypertension and can be a kind of essential hypertension. Both gestational and chronic hypertension can lead to preeclampsia , a potentially serious but treatable complication of pregnancy. 14 For more information, take a look at this resource on preeclampsia. Q: What is hypertensive heart disease? A: Hypertensive heart disease is an umbrella term for various heart conditions that are caused by chronically or prolonged high blood pressure levels. High blood pressure puts extra strain on the heart and the vessels surrounding and supplying the heart, something which can lead to the development of a variety of heart disorders. These include heart failure, coronary artery disease and the thickening of the heart muscle, among others. People at risk of hypertensive heart disease should talk to their doctor about methods of preventing potential complications, e.g. attending regular check-ups and taking medication regularly as required by their prescription. This will typically also include getting plenty of exercise, eating a balanced, nutritious diet and losing weight, if the person in question is considerably overweight or obese."

    "condition": "Essential Tremor",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/essential-tremor/",
    "what_is_essential_tremor": "Essential tremor is a neurological condition causing involuntary shaking or jerking. The hands and arms are the body parts most often affected by essential tremor, but the movements can sometimes involve the rest of the body and its functions, particularly the head and the voice. 1 2 In some cases, these symptoms can be mild and do not require any treatment. However, a person badly affected by tremors can find everyday tasks difficult to complete. The exact cause of essential tremor is unknown. However, most evidence suggests that there is a genetic link. People with essential tremor usually have a family member that also has the condition. 3 Essential tremor is among the most common movement disorders, with around one in 50 Americans thought to be living with the condition. 4 The majority of those affected are over 40 , but symptoms can begin at a younger age. 3 1 Essential tremor can sometimes be confused with other conditions that cause tremor such as Parkinson’s disease and dystonia. Treatment for essential tremor is aimed at managing the symptoms through medication, therapy and lifestyle management, rather than trying to cure the condition . Tremors tend to get worse over time, but most people affected experience a lessening of their symptoms after treatment. In more severe cases, doctors may suggest surgical intervention, targeting the thalamus within the brain.",
    "essential_tremor_symptoms": "The most common symptoms of essential tremor are fast, shaky movements in the hands and arms. The two main types of tremor experienced by people with essential tremor are: 5 6 Postural tremor, which occurs when holding the body in any kind of posture against the weight of gravity, such as holding the arms upright Kinetic tremor, which occurs when completing any voluntary movement, such as drinking a glass of water or tying shoelaces In some cases, essential tremor can also occur when the affected person is at rest, e.g., sitting or lying down. The movements can affect both sides of the body, but are usually noticed more often in the dominant hand, as it gets worse when doing intentional movements, such as reaching for a glass or grabbing a pencil. 1 Essential tremor can also affect other body parts. The areas most commonly affected besides the hands and arms are: 6 1 The head, which moves in a nodding yes or shaking no movement The voice, which shakes or quivers during speaking The jaw, which clenches or bites repeatedly Other parts of the upper body and the legs are sometimes affected by essential tremor, although this is rare. 1 If you are experiencing tremor-like symptoms, then try a symptom assessment on the Ada app .\n\nIn mild cases, symptoms can cause little to no disruption to daily life. However, in more severe cases, the shaking can stop people from completing everyday tasks and may cause embarrassment or stress . Studies have shown that people with essential tremor are more likely to experience depressive episodes and anxiety . 7 Treatments for these mental health conditions include talking therapy and medication.\n\nEssential tremor can often be confused with Parkinson’s disease, which also causes tremors. This is partly because there are  no laboratory tests as yet to confirm a diagnosis of either of these conditions easily. Doctors generally rely on using physical examinations and questions about medical history to decide which condition the affected person has. While tremor is the main symptom of essential tremor, those with Parkinson’s disease also experience the following: 8 9 Slowness of movement, or even “freezing” when wanting to start a movement Rigid muscles People with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to experience tremor symptoms while they are at rest. The tremor in Parkinson’s disease tends  less often to be an action tremor, i.e., one that occurs during intentional movements, such as grabbing a glass or using cutlery. There are also a number of other differences between the tremors caused by Parkinson’s and those experienced by people with essential tremor: 6 10 9 Tremors caused by Parkinson’s disease are usually slower Alcohol can reduce the symptoms of essential tremor, but has no effect on a tremor caused by Parkinson’s disease Tremor in the head is more frequently observed in essential tremor than in Parkinson’s disease A period of a few seconds or even minutes between a person holding their body against gravity and the tremor beginning may be more common in Parkinson’s disease. This pause between a posture that triggers tremor and the tremor beginning is less likely to be seen in people with essential tremor Several tests can be used to help a doctor in attempts to distinguish between the two conditions, including ones that look at the power and the frequency of a tremor in action. A person can be affected by both essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease at the same time. Read more about Parkinson’s disease »",
    "essential_tremor_causes": "The exact cause of essential tremor is unknown, but research has suggested that it may be due to some sort of minor brain dysfunction. The majority of people affected have a close relative that also has the condition. If a parent has essential tremor, then there is thought to be a 50% chance that their child will develop the condition at some point in its life . 11 The symptoms of essential tremor are likelier to appear as the affected person gets older. Most people with the condition are not diagnosed until they reach their 40s . 3 1 However, essential tremor has been observed in people of all ages, including children. It is thought that several factors can make a tremor worse. They include: 11 12 Caffeine, e.g. through coffee or energy drinks Other stimulants Anxiety and stress, as well as mental exhaustion Tiredness and physical exhaustion Low blood sugar",
    "essential_tremor_diagnosis": "Essential tremor is usually diagnosed after a medical exam, which includes the affected person explaining their symptoms to a medical professional. A doctor may ask for certain tasks to be completed, or certain body movements to be made, so the tremor can be seen in action. As the cause for essential tremor remains unknown, there is no test to diagnose it for certain. However, a medical professional may still recommend tests to rule out other causes for the tremor, e.g. multiple sclerosis or head trauma. These tests can include: 3 12 Blood tests Magnetic resonance imaging scans X-rays",
    "essential_tremor_treatment": "There is no cure for essential tremor, but several treatment options exist that can minimize the symptoms. 3 In mild cases, where there is little to no disruption to daily life and activities, the person affected may need no treatment at all. When a person’s quality of life begins to be diminished by essential tremor, the first course of action will usually be medication.\n\nThere are two types of medication generally used to minimize tremor: 3 11 Beta-blockers: These work by blocking the hormones adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/norepinephrine from reaching their target sites within the body and thereby also hindering these hormones’ regular effects on the body, e.g. this slows down the speed of the heart beat. The most commonly used beta-blocker for essential tremor is propranolol, which lessens the symptoms of over half of people with the condition. Anti-seizure medications: When beta-blockers do not work or are not tolerated, anti-seizure medication such as primidone, which is usually used to treat epilepsy, may be prescribed. Both of these types of medication have some side effects, which a physician will advise upon before use. Beta-blockers and anti-seizure medication usually do not improve vocal tremor. 13 14\n\nInjecting botulinum toxin, which is commonly known as botox, is an effective treatment for tremor in the head, neck and voice. 13 It can also be used for tremor in other parts of the body, but the muscle weakness it causes may outweigh the benefits.\n\nWhen medication is not effective in treating a person’s tremors, surgical intervention may be recommended. All types of surgery for essential tremor currently involve the thalamus, which is located deep within the brain. The thalamus is crucial for communication between the brain and the rest of the body. The three main thalamic interventions are: 2 3\n\nFor this type of intervention, long thin wires with electrodes on the tips are implanted into one or both sides of the thalamus during surgery. These wires are hooked up to a battery-operated electrical device known as a neurostimulator, which is implanted underneath the skin of the chest, near to the collarbone. The neurostimulator can be turned on and off by a magnet. Electrical signals are sent from the neurostimulator to the thalamus. In many cases, this seems to reduce the severity of tremors. 15 ref1 The advantage of choosing deep brain stimulation as an intervention is that no lasting damage is caused to brain tissue, which can sometimes occur during a thalamotomy. 1\n\nDuring a thalamotomy,  a small part of the thalamus is very precisely targeted and removed. A technique known as focused ultrasound has relatively recently emerged as a non-invasive method of performing a thalamotomy using soundwaves. 16 A person undergoing a focused ultrasound thalamotomy will have their head shaved and have their head placed in a frame. A silicone cap is placed on the skull and linked up to the device that produces the sound waves and is known as an ultrasonic transducer.  The transducer is filled with chilled, degassed water that can be delivered into the cap between the soundwaves to prevent the skull overheating. The person undergoing the procedure is then placed into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, which allows the doctor to very precisely guide the ultrasound waves towards the part of the thalamus that needs to be targeted. 17 A thalamotomy is usually only performed on one side of the brain. This means that it will only usually improve tremor in the right or left half of the body.  If both sides of the brain are targeted, there is a considerable risk of a person’s ability to speak being affected, as well as some other potential side effects.\n\nA conventional thalamotomy also removes a small part of the thalamus. During a conventional thalamotomy, a burr hole is drilled into the skull, through which a probe is guided into the thalamus. A doctor will then use radiofrequency to target the relevant part of the thalamus. 18 Conventional thalamotomy is a rarely performed procedure in the western hemisphere. The necessity for permanently removing part of the thalamus means, that deep brain stimulation is generally preferred by doctors. 15 Good to know: Thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation may potentially have some serious, adverse side-effects, which a clinician will go over before treatment, so the person involved can make an informed decision weighing in the benefits as well the risks of these treatment options.\n\nExercise or physical therapy can help build muscle strength and improve muscle control, which can give people with essential tremor more control over their body. A physical therapist can recommend which activities are beneficial and safe, depending on the severity of the person’s symptoms and also their daily activities and needs. Speech therapy can sometimes be helpful and is therefore recommended for people affected by vocal tremor. 13 Occupational therapy can assist a person in adapting to lifestyle changes caused by tremor. For example, an occupational therapist treating essential tremor may recommend the use of weighted utensils and plates for eating. 7\n\nPeople with essential tremor may be advised to cut food and drink containing caffeine out of their diet. This includes: 1 19 Coffee Energy drinks and some sodas Dark chocolate Coffee-flavoured ice creams Some over-the-counter medications, particularly painkillers, may also contain caffeine. To find out if a medication contains caffeine, check the label before use, or in case of doubt, ask your pharmacist or doctor. The symptoms of essential tremor may lead a person to eat less, because of the added difficulty of both cooking and using cutlery. An occupational therapist should be able to advise on special implements such as weighted cutlery, as well as cooking methods adapted to a person with the condition’s needs.\n\nThere are no scientific studies that support the use of natural or herbal remedies in reducing essential tremor. However, treatments that can induce relaxation, such as massage or aromatherapy, may be useful in reducing stress, which is a contributing factor for tremor that can make it specifically worse in many cases. Consult with a doctor before trying any alternative therapies, and don’t discontinue any previously prescribed treatment, without first checking in with your doctor. 20 21\n\nMost people with essential tremor find that drinking alcohol can lessen any shaking symptoms while they are occuring. 1 3 This is also one way of distinguishing essential tremor from Parkinson’s disease, as tremors caused by the latter condition do not respond to alcohol. However, tremors may worsen after the effects of the alcohol wear off. 1 There is also the danger of becoming dependent on alcohol, which can cause many negative health and undesirable social effects.",

    "faqs": "Q: Essential tremor vs. intention tremor: what is the difference? A: While essential tremor is a condition, intention tremor is a type of tremor , specifically a type of kinetic action tremor, that may be experienced by a person affected by essential tremor. Intention tremor describes a tremor felt as a person completes an action directed towards a target, such as putting a key into a lock. The tremor usually intensifies the closer the person gets to the target. 1"

    "condition": "Fabry Disease",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/fabry-disease/",
    "what_is_fabry_disease": "Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A – also known as alpha-GAL. Alpha-GAL breaks down a fat called globotriaosylceramide (GL-3 or Gb3), which is normally produced inside healthy cells. A lack of alpha-GAL causes this substance to build up inside the cell and disturb normal cell function, causing symptoms. 1 Fabry disease is one of a number of hereditary conditions known as lysosomal storage disorders, all of which cause problems with normal cell function. 2 Fabry disease is very rare, and it is roughly estimated that it affects between 1 in 17,000 and 1 in 117,000 people. Due to the way in which it is passed on through genes, men are more likely to inherit the condition than women, with roughly 1 in every 20,000 to 40,000 men thought to have the condition.",
    "symptoms": "Signs of the condition typically manifest in early childhood and develop as the person ages. The symptoms of Fabry disease are varied and some are potentially life threatening. The following symptoms are most commonly observed in childhood and adolescence, though they may be experienced in adulthood too: 3 Pain and burning sensations, particularly in the hands and feet Dark red spots on the skin, typically between the belly button and knees, sometimes referred to as angiokeratoma Clouded vision Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and general hearing problems Stomach, back, or kidney pain Gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea The following, more serious, symptoms of Fabry’s disease are more likely to appear in adulthood: Osteoporosis Heart attack or heart failure Enlarged heart Stroke Kidney failure or serious renal complications Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your free symptom assessment in the Ada app .",
    "causes": "Fabry disease is caused by a genetic mutation. It is an X-linked disorder, meaning that the condition only affects the X-chromosome. As females have two X-chromosomes and males just one, males stand a far higher chance of inheriting the condition from a parent, because a second  X-chromosome offers some – but not total – protection against the mutation. 4 The children of females with Fabry disease, both male and female, stand a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Female children of males with Fabry disease will always inherit the disorder, though they may not always display symptoms. Male children of males with the condition will not inherit Fabry disease. The genetic defect leads to a lack of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A that in turn leads to a buildup of globotriaosylceramide, a type of fat that is normally broken down as part of healthy cell function. The severity of the disorder depends on how much alpha-galactosidase the body produces. In some, this can be none at all, while in others the enzyme is present but in insufficient quantities. 5",
    "diagnosing_fabry_disease": "The early diagnosis of Fabry disease is important for beginning the management of the condition. This process may begin when a person displays some of the common symptoms and a doctor suspects the presence of the disorder. However, due to the rarity of Fabry disease, the initial signs of the disorder may not be recognized and the disorder left undiagnosed. If an individual or family member has observed similar symptoms in other family members and there is a suspicion of the condition, a doctor’s opinion should be sought. 6 Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Fabry disease. Enzyme assay, as the method is known, measures the volume of alpha-galactosidase A in the body. For males, this involves a blood test . If the blood shows a person has low levels of the enzyme, Fabry disease can be confirmed. This test can also be carried out on females, but may not be as accurate. DNA testing is a far more accurate test for Fabry disease diagnosis in females. Prenatal (before birth) testing for Fabry disease is also available, though this test will usually only be offered to parents with Fabry disease or those with a strong family history of the disorder.",
    "treatment": "There is no cure for Fabry disease so treatment is centered on managing the symptoms of the disorder. This can be combined with enzyme replacement therapy, which has demonstrated some success in combating the enzyme deficiency and should be started as soon as a diagnosis is made. 7\n\nEnzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is aimed at reversing the abnormalities in the cells of those with Fabry disease, thereby easing the symptoms of the condition. 8 Only in use since 2001, ERT is a relatively new treatment method for people with Fabry disease. Two medications are available for this treatment, Replagal and Fabrazyme, both of which are given through a drip into the veins. ERT has been shown to improve symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of kidney problems, stroke, andhearing loss. ref8 Although enzyme-replacement therapy aims to treat the cause of Fabry disease, additional treatments might be needed to reduce symptoms and prevent complications.\n\nTo combat pain, doctors will generally prescribe pain relief medication such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, phenytoin and opioids. The latter are generally reserved for particularly severe pain.\n\nThe skin rash associated with Fabry disease does not generally cause discomfort but can in some cases bleed. Cosmetic treatments such as laser therapy may be used to remove or lessen the rash.\n\nIndividuals experiencing hearing loss can be fitted with a hearing aid.\n\nGastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting and nausea are often managed with medications. Doctors may also advise people experiencing gastrointestinal problems to avoid any foods that trigger symptoms and to maintain a low-fat diet.",
    "fabry_disease_prognosis": "The prognosis for Fabry disease depends on how early the condition is diagnosed and the severity of the symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment can be effective in reducing the risk of complications developing. Those with severe symptoms or who develop severe complications can expect a poorer prognosis than those with milder symptoms. On average, males with the condition have a life expectancy of roughly 60 years and females roughly 75 years. 9",

    "fabry_disease_faqs": "Q: What is the life expectancy of people with Fabry disease? A: Males with the Fabry disease have a life expectancy of roughly 60 years, while women have a life expectancy of roughly 75 years. Life expectancy, however, strongly depends on the severity of the condition and the age at which it is diagnosed. Q: Can Fabry disease be detected by looking at the eyes? A: Opticians and other eyecare professionals may be able to detect the presence of a cloudy buildup on the front of the eye, which can often be an early symptom of the condition. However, full confirmation of the diagnosis of Fabry disease is only possible with further testing. 10 Q: What are the symptoms of Fabry disease in females? A: Females with Fabry disease can develop the same symptoms of Fabry disease as men, including pain and burning sensations, rashes and gastrointestinal problems. In general, however, females develop these symptoms later and to a less severe extent than males. 11 If you are worried you may have Fabry disease, you can check your symptoms with the free Ada app ."

    "condition": "Failure to Thrive",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/failure-to-thrive/",
    "what_is_failure_to_thrive": "Failure to thrive (FTT) is defined as a delay in physical growth and weight gain in babies and children. As children mature, they are normally carefully monitored by doctors to ensure that they are growing at a healthy rate. Percentiles are used to compare children of the same age and sex. If a child is said to be in the tenth percentile, for example, it means that out of 100 children, 90 children weigh more and 10 weigh less than or the same as the child of interest. A diagnosis of failure to thrive is generally given to children who consistently register as being below the third to fifth percentiles, though this can differ from country to country. If a child dramatically falls from one percentile to another, from the 70th percentile to the 30th, for example, this may also be diagnosed as failure to thrive, even if their weight is not significantly low. 1 The causes of failure to thrive are often complex, with medical disorders, as well as environmental and social factors, all playing a role. There is no specific treatment for the condition. Instead, the underlying causes will be considered and doctors and other medical professionals will outline a management plan based on this. Although failure to thrive is most common in babies and children, it can also occur in elderly people, with symptoms including weight loss, frailty and loss of appetite. Management, as with children, typically involves addressing the underlying set of causes.",
    "causes": "The basic cause of failure to thrive is a child not receiving, or being unable to retain and absorb, the necessary amount of calories and nutrients needed to support healthy growth. The reasons behind this failure are numerous, and more than one factor may play a role simultaneously. There are, however, two broad reasons why failure to thrive occurs: medical disorders and social/environmental factors.\n\nMedical disorders that may contribute to a failure to thrive include: 1 2 Problems chewing or swallowing caused by a cleft palate for example Gastrointestinal problems Brain or nervous system damage Heart or lung problems Genetic problems, such as Down syndrome Hormone problems Metabolic disorders, such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis Blood disorders, such as anemia Chronic infections, such as HIV\n\nSocial and environmental factors as to why a child does not receive sufficient nutrition can include poverty, parental neglect or abuse, and parental mental health issues. Parents may also feed their child food lacking in sufficient nutrients or not be aware of how to properly prepare food and formula. Social and environmental factors are the most common cause of failure to thrive. 1",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms experienced as a result of failure to thrive depend on the severity and the underlying cause or causes of the condition. However, the key symptom of the condition is a child not developing and growing normally as compared to children of the same age and sex. Symptoms of failure to thrive include: 2 3 Height, weight and head circumference which do not match with standard growth charts Weight which consistently falls below the third to fifth percentile Growth which has stopped or slowed significantly Physical skills which do not develop as expected, such as standing and walking Mental and social skills which do not develop as expected Constipation Excessive crying Excessive sleepiness Irritability Children may not experience all the possible symptoms of failure to thrive.",
    "failure_to_thrive_diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made by a child health nurse or pediatrician following routine check-ups, during which weight, height and head circumference measurements are taken. The parents may also be asked about feeding routines and any issues that may be affecting the child’s access to proper nutrition, as well as about the family’s medical history. If there are signs that a child is failing to thrive, further tests may be undertaken to investigate and diagnose the underlying causes.",
    "failure_to_thrive_treatment": "The treatment of failure to thrive depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is the result of an underlying medical disorder, treatment will be aimed at remedying or managing this condition. If social and environmental factors are the cause, parental counseling and support may be recommended. The aim of this is to educate the parents about proper nutrition and to help find solutions to any financial and/or emotional issues that may be present. A meal plan may also be devised for the child to ensure that they receive the calories and nutrition needed. In cases of severe failure to thrive, a child may be admitted to hospital where a team of doctors, pediatricians, nutritionists and social workers, among other professionals, will work together to formulate an appropriate treatment plan.",
    "prevention": "Regular checkups with a child health nurse can help to diagnose failure to thrive early on. Parenting classes or support groups are also a good way to develop ways and habits of improving a child’s nutrition.",
    "failure_to_thrive_prognosis": "If failure to thrive is diagnosed early and appropriate steps are taken to remedy the condition then long-term health problems are unlikely. However, if this does not happen, especially if the child is in their first year of life – a period critical to development – they may experience long-term mental developmental difficulties affecting their verbal and mathematical skills, as well as their behavioral, social and emotional abilities. 1",
    "failure_to_thrive_in_elderly_adults": "Although failure to thrive is most commonly associated with infants and children, the condition can also be diagnosed in elderly people. 4 There is no widely agreed definition of FTT in elderly people, but it is generally described as a syndrome involving: ref4 Weight loss Loss of appetite Poor nutrition Frailty Inactivity Dehydration Depression Immune dysfunction Low cholesterol Failure to thrive in elderly people is caused by a combination of factors, including the process of aging, as well as social circumstances, such as social isolation, lack of support and low socioeconomic status. Treatment generally involves managing the underlying set of causes. If you or a loved one is displaying symptoms that may be linked to failure to thrive, try using the free Ada app for a symptom assessment.",
    "other_names_for_failure_to_thrive": "Poor infant growth FTT",
    "failure_to_thrive_faqs": "Q: Can failure to thrive be fatal? A: Yes, in severe cases, when treatment is not received, failure to thrive can be fatal. This is true of failure to thrive in babies and children, as well as elderly people. Mortality as a result of the condition, however, is unlikely if prompt and appropriate treatment is received. Q: What is the relationship between failure to thrive and autism? A: The link between failure to thrive and autism has yet to be fully explored, but there does seem to be a relationship between childhood autism and feeding problems, a common feature of failure to thrive. Babies and infants with autism will not necessarily have FTT and vice versa, but severe feeding problems in very young children should alert doctors to the possibility of autism. Q: Can failure to thrive cause microcephaly? A: Yes, failure to thrive can cause microcephaly or a smaller head circumference than normal. Microcephaly may be an indicator to doctors that a baby or child is experiencing failure to thrive. However, some babies or children with microcephaly may experience no other symptoms of failure to thrive."

    "condition": "Familial Hypercholesterolemia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/",
    "what_is_familial_hypercholesterolemia": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is a hereditary condition , characterized by high total cholesterol levels and, specifically, elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein  – otherwise known as LDLc or “bad” cholesterol. 1 Cholesterol is a waxy fat that occurs naturally in the body and is found in all the body's cells. HDL and LDL are fat proteins known as lipoproteins, which play a role in the transport of cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol builds up, an individual is at risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart conditions. 2 As the condition is genetic, it cannot be fully cured. However, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.",
    "causes": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutated gene. This mutation disrupts the body’s ability to remove low-density lipoprotein from the blood as it normally would, resulting in the development of high levels of cholesterol. The condition is autosomal dominant, meaning the gene mutation can be inherited if only one parent is a carrier. In these instances, the condition is known as heterozygous FH. In the rare case where both parents are carriers, a particularly severe variety of familial hypercholesterolemia known as homozygous FH will be passed on. The condition is differentiated from standard hypercholesterolemia by its hereditary nature. Anyone can develop hypercholesterolemia – which is generally caused by unhealthy lifestyle choices – whereas only those with a family history of the condition can develop familial hypercholesterolemia. Standard high cholesterol generally develops in older individuals, whereas the genetic variety is present from birth and has a tendency to be more aggressive. 3",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "In many cases, especially in younger people, there will be no obvious symptoms of familial hypercholesterolemia. However, if signs and symptoms do present themselves, they may include: 1 Xanthomas: Fatty deposits on the skin that typically appear on the hands, knees, buttocks, elbows and ankles. Xanthelasmas: Deposits of cholesterol around the eyelids. Arcus senilis: A white-colored ring around the cornea Arthralgia (joint pain) Tendonitis (inflamed tendons) History of unusual skin lesions At least one parent with severe hypercholesterolemia The most significant consequence of familial hypercholesterolemia, however, is heart disease . In cases of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, signs of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, such as angina and heart attack , will appear in middle age if the condition is not treated. In cases of homozygous hypercholesterolemia, symptoms occur in childhood, and many people with this condition die before the age of 20. Heart disease can lead to potentially life-threatening complications such as heart attack.",
    "diagnosing_familial_hypercholesterolemia": "Diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia will generally involve three stages: an examination of the affected person’s medical history, a physical examination and blood tests.\n\nAs familial hypercholesterolemia is hereditary, doctors will first inquire about a person’s family medical history. This will particularly focus on the parents, who are the carriers of the disorder. In some cases, the genetic form of the condition may have been misdiagnosed as standard hypercholesterolemia or may not have been diagnosed at all, meaning that it is possible to be unknowingly at risk of developing the genetic form of the condition. If you are concerned that you or someone in your family may have this condition, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time using the Ada app.\n\nDoctors will also carry out a full physical examination to help diagnose familial hypercholesterolemia. This will particularly focus on checking for fatty deposits on the skin of hands, ankles, knees, elbows et al. and around the eyes – one of the more common exterior symptoms of high cholesterol levels. The doctor will also conduct a thorough cardiovascular examination.\n\nBlood tests will be ordered to confirm a diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. Blood tests will check for an individual’s total cholesterol level ( HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol ) as well as the specific amount of LDL cholesterol. Adults with the condition will normally have total cholesterol levels of around 300 milligrams per deciliter and over, whereas children will have levels of around 250 milligrams per deciliter and over. LDL cholesterol levels will typically be around 220 milligrams per deciliter and over in adults and around 170-200 milligrams per deciliter and over in children. 4 However, the exact levels involved will differ according to whether the condition is heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In heterozygous FH, LDLc levels are usually higher than 250mg/dL, around 290mg/dL to 300mg/dL, and increase with age. In people younger than 20 years of age, an LDLc level higher than 200mg/dL suggests heterozygous FH. In homozygous FH, however, total cholesterol and LDLc levels higher than 600mg/dL are typical in both adults and children. Genetic tests can also be used to determine the presence of the defective gene, and a test for fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) can allow doctors to see how the body is absorbing cholesterol. Read more about Blood Test Results »",
    "familial_hypercholesterolemia_treatment": "Treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia aims to  reduce the risk of heart disease or heart attack. It usually combines the use of: Medication: Statins (medicines which help lower the level of LDL in the blood) are typically prescribed to treat familial hypercholesterolemia. They are generally effective, but may be necessary throughout an individual’s life. Another medication, ezetimibe, may also be prescribed alongside statins if statins alone are ineffective. 1 For patients with FH, particularly homozygous FH, treatment should ideally be managed by a lipid specialist. Diet and lifestyle changes: Combating high cholesterol levels may also involve making healthy lifestyle choices, such as avoiding tobacco products, excessive amounts of alcohol and remaining physically active. Diet changes may also be necessary. This will focus on avoiding saturated fats present in foods, such as dairy products, meat and pastry. 5 A vegetarian or even vegan lifestyle may be the best option for people with FH.",
    "familial_hypercholesterolemia_prognosis": "The prognosis for familial hypercholesterolemia is dependent on how closely an individual follows the lifestyle and diet recommendations, as well as how well the body responds to the medication. Lifestyle changes and medications can help significantly delay heart disease or heart attack. Those with homozygous FH will generally receive a less positive prognosis, as will those who experience early complications, such as heart problems in childhood. 6",
    "familial_hypercholesterolemia_faqs": "Q: What is the life expectancy for those with familial hypercholesterolemia? A: Without treatment, the life expectancy of those with familial hypercholesterolemia can be reduced by approximately 15-30 years. However, in people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the life expectancy may only be 20 years or less. Treatment, however, can manage the condition and lead to a significantly improved prognosis. 7 Q: Can familial hypercholesterolemia be treated without the use of statins? A: Statins are normally the preferred medication for treating high cholesterol. However, if side effects occur, or statins are not an available option for various reasons, there are other medications which can be used instead. These include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, sequestrants and niacin or vitamin B-3. The choice of treatment route should always be decided based on the recommendations of a medical professional. 8"

It is important that the child is safe during the seizure, so may help to place them on a large bed, or on the floor, away from objects that they may hit. Turn them onto their side in the recovery position. There is no need to hold the child down during the seizure, and nothing should be put in their mouth. The duration of seizures should be measured and it lasts longer than 5 minutes with no signs of stopping, an ambulance should be called, or the child should be taken to hospital for review.",

Symptoms may include growth problems, behavioral problems, and learning difficulties. Due to broad range of symptoms and their severity, diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The condition is most commonly detected in children during kindergarten or primary school, when learning difficulties become apparent. Although there is no cure for fetal alcohol syndrome, early diagnosis and intensive support can ease some symptoms. Without diagnosis or sufficient support, people with this condition are more likely to suffer social and health disadvantages.",
    "risks": "Fetal alcohol syndrome means that alcohol has caused problems for the unborn baby (the fetus) during its development. Alcohol especially affects the development of the brain, heart, eyes and kidneys. Women who have a dependency on alcohol around the time of their pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome. This condition can be difficult to diagnose, so, although it is most commonly diagnosed in childhood, it can also be first diagnosed later in life.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome can be different from person to person, depending on how much alcohol the mother drank and the stage in the pregnancy that this occurred. Typical signs of fetal alcohol syndrome in a newborn baby include being small at birth and certain facial characteristics, such as wide-set eyes, flattening of the groove between the nose and mouth, and a thin upper lip. As the child gets older, other problems may become obvious, such as learning difficulties, attention difficulties (many children have attention deficit disorder), hearing or vision problems, and behavioral problems, such as impulsiveness and hyperactivity.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome is often complicated because the signs and symptoms can be difficult to recognize. The diagnosis is made by an experienced pediatrician based on the appearance and symptoms of a child whose mother drank alcohol while pregnant. The main features needed to diagnose this condition are: growth problems, the characteristic facial features (a thin upper lip, smoothed groove between nose and mouth, wide-set eyes) and signs or symptoms of developmental brain problems (learning difficulties, low IQ) in a mother who drank alcohol while pregnant.",

    "what_are_fibrocystic_breasts": "The term fibrocystic breasts, also called fibrocystic mastopathy or mastopathia fibrosa cystica, describes a change in the connective tissue of the breasts. Two types of changes are typical: fibrosis – a proliferation of connective tissue cysts – small, liquid-filled cavities in the tissue. The breasts can feel knotty, hardened, or even be painful. Discharge from the nipples can also occur. The symptoms often change during the menstrual cycle. Fibrocystic mastopathy is not a cancer. It is the most common benign tissue change experienced in the breasts and affects about every second woman. Premenopausal women between the ages of 30 and 50 years are often affected. Fibrocystic mastopathy is a collective term with numerous subtypes of the condition, some of which have very different characteristics. The changes in tissue can make breast cancer screening more difficult and should always be clarified in order to rule out serious diseases. Individual subtypes can increase the risk of breast cancer. In most cases, however, no treatment is required. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 If you think that you might have fibrocystic breasts, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Fibrocystic changes in the breast occur in women of childbearing age and usually subside with the onset of menopause. The tissue changes depend on the menstrual cycle. Pregnancy and lactation also have an effect on these tissue changes. Although the exact mechanisms have not yet been clarified, it is assumed that the changes are a reaction to the fluctuations of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the body. High oestrogen levels and low progesterone concentrations seem to increase the likelihood of the development of fibrocystic breasts. 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 Factors that increase the risk are: 3 , 6 , 7 Women of childbearing age Women who have not yet had a child late onset of menopause being overweight higher age at birth of first child Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen Factors that reduce the risk are: 3 , 6 , 7 Women who have given birth to several children Treatment with tamoxifen (a drug from breast cancer treatment)",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms in women with fibrocystic breasts can vary from woman to woman. Since the term also encompasses a number of different subtypes as a collective term, the possible complaints also vary depending on the subtype present. The symptoms are often most severe a few days before the onset of menstruation and decrease shortly after the onset of menstrual bleeding. In addition, the symptoms are often symmetrical and occur in both breasts. However, some women who are diagnosed with fibrocystic mastopathy have not noticed any symptoms beforehand. 3 , 4 , 8 Possible symptoms are: 3 , 4 , 8 Pain in the breasts can be dependent on the course of the menstrual cycle are often persistent and dull are sometimes also perceived as throbbing or burning mostly diffuse in both breasts, partly also with pain peaks at separate locations Pressure painfulness during palpation (Nodes in the breasts) mostly symmetrical in both breasts often in numerous locations discharge from the nipples can be grayish, greenish, dark, or milky in rare cases also bloody/watery and with a high quantity can occur on one or both sides Change in breast size local hardening which is palpable If you think that you might have fibrocystic breasts, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_is_the_diagnosis": "Often lumps in the breast are noticed by the affected women themselves or are noticed during a routine examination. However, there are a number of different possible causes for this, which require further evaluation. A gynaecologist will first ask about the symptoms, their course and the medical history in a so-called anamnesis. The doctor will then perform a thorough physical examination focussing on the inspection and palpation of the breast. This can confirm the suspicion of a tissue change and further examinations can be requested in order to arrive at the correct diagnosis. 2 , 3 , 4 , 9 The following diagnostic methods can be used: 3 Ultrasound of the breast Mammography Biopsy Ultrasound and mammography examinations are usually performed on all affected women who: 3 Have a known, persistent lump in their breast Show a lump in their breast during a physical examination Suspicious discharge from one or both nipples A biopsy is only necessary if the other two examination procedures confirm the suspicion of a change in the breast tissue. 1) Ultrasound of the breast: Ultrasound is a procedure in which the reflection of sound waves is used to show differences in density of the tissue. The procedure is easy to use and has no negative side effects.A doctor can use it to obtain images of the inner breast tissue. In particular cysts, small, liquid-filled cavities, can be identified and examined well in this way. 1 , 3 There are different types of cysts, which have to be evaluated differently: 1 , 3 Simple cyst: This type of cyst appears on the ultrasound image as a small cavity that is filled exclusively with fluid and can be clearly defined Simple cysts are completely harmless and are not pathological If the cyst causes pain, the inner fluid of the cyst can be punctured under ultrasound control Complicated or complex cysts: In addition to liquid components, solid components can also be found here These types of cysts require further evaluation in order to rule out malignancy Good to know: Depending on the menstrual cycle, cysts can increase and decrease in size and thus trigger tension pains. The pain typically occurs in the days before menstruation and subsides quickly after the onset of menstruation. 2) Mammography: Mammography is an X-ray of the breasts. This allows the doctor to check for any abnormal cell growth and structural changes within the the breast tissue. In women with fibrocystic mastopathy, the images usually show circumscribed areas with increased density. However, in order to distinguish a harmless finding from a malignancy, a biopsy following mammography will be necessary. 3 Good to know: The diagnostic value of a mammography can be limited, especially for women under 40 years of age, as the breast tissue in this age group is even denser than in older women. This can make it more difficult to find pathological densifications. 8 3) Biopsy: A biopsy is a procedure in which a tissue sample or liquid is obtained using a needle. The cells from the tissue sample are then examined under a microscope and examined for possible degenerations. This way, an exact diagnosis can be made. 3 , 10 , 11 There are different types of biopsies that are used depending on the nature and localization of the tissue in question. The procedures are performed under local anesthesia, thus avoiding pain. Good to know: About 80 percent of women who undergo a breast biopsy do not have breast cancer . 10",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_fibrocystic_breasts": "Most women affected by fibrocystic mastopathy do not require specific treatment. However, if symptoms are found to be restrictive, the symptoms can be specifically treated and thus alleviated. 3 The following can help with pain in the breasts: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 9 Wearing a supporting bra This can reduce the feeling of tension Taking over-the-counter painkillers Should only be taken temporarily and in consultation with a doctor or pharmacist Warm compresses can be tried out individually If the woman is under hormone replacement therapy, a modification of this may be considered Should only be carried out in consultation with the treating physician Diet changes Little scientific evidence Can be tried out individually Reduction of the intake of caffeinated beverages Reduction of food with high salt content Fibre-rich, low-fat diet Hormone therapy Severe pain lasting at least 6 months In consultation with the attending physician Due to possible side effects usually only used in intervals Puncturing of simple cysts that cause symptoms With a biopsy needle under ultrasound control Can be repeated if necessary If simple cysts don’t cause any complaints, however, there is no need for any measures If there is discharge from the nipples: 3 If the discharge has been evaluated by a doctor and classified as harmless, it is sufficient to observe the discharge from there on Use bra inserts Changes in outflow, especially bloody or extensive outflow, should be re-examined by a physician If you think that you might have fibrocystic breasts, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",

This condition is of genetic origin and present from birth, but is often only diagnosed during adolescence. FOP causes bone to form in the muscles and tendons. The bony lumps can occur without a cause or after an injury such as bruises or muscle strains. This causes pain and limits movement. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the symptoms and genetic testing. There's no cure for this condition but there are medicines that can help with some of the symptoms.",
    "what_are_risk_factors_for_fop": "The condition most often correlates with a specific gene changing. This altered gene may then be passed down from a parent with the condition to their children who will most likely get the condition. FOP is very rare with only about 800 known cases worldwide. The bony lumps can occur after an injury such as bruises or muscle strains.",

    "condition": "Folate Deficiency",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/folate-deficiency/",
    "what_is_folate_deficiency": "Folate is also known as Vitamin B9 . It is one of a group of important vitamins involved in cell metabolism. Folate plays a critical role in the synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins. Deficiency can therefore cause impairment of cell division and an accumulation of possibly toxic metabolites, e.g. homocysteine. Along with Vitamin B12, folate is important for regulating the manufacture of red blood cells. 1\n\nThe synthetic form of folate is folic acid, which converts to folate in the body. Because folic acid is more easily absorbed by the body, it is the form most commonly used in supplements and fortified foods. Many plants, particularly green leafy vegetables, and animal products contain folate. Thus, most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand. If supplementation doesn’t occur, this may lead to deficiency. Folate deficiency is most commonly found in pregnant and lactating women, people with chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, people following restricted diets due to weight-loss regimes or medical conditions, people with alcohol dependence and people more than 65 years of age. 2 Folate deficiency will not go away on its own. Treatment is required and may involve dietary changes and/or oral supplements and treatment of underlying causes, if any are present. If left untreated, folate deficiency may result in folate deficiency anemia, which can cause severe complications. 3",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Common symptoms of folate deficiency can include: 2 4 Tiredness, fatigue and lethargy Muscle weakness Neurological signs, such as a feeling of pins and needles, tingling, or burning, or peripheral neuropathy, i.e. a numbness in the extremities Psychological problems, such as depression , confusion, memory problems, problems of judgment and understanding Gastrointestinal signs, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain , weight loss and diarrhea Headache and dizziness Pallor Shortness of breath. Headache, dizziness, pallor and shortness of breath are also symptoms of anemia . Anemia, particularly megaloblastic anemia, is often the first sign that there is an underlying folate deficiency, and doctors will usually test for folate and Vitamin B12 deficiencies when they encounter anemia. Less common symptoms of folate deficiency are: 2 Fast heartbeat (tachycardia) Fast breathing (tachypnoea) Exfoliative dermatitis, a condition which makes the skin red and scaly Heart murmur Painful swallowing A sore tongue (glossitis) and mouth ulcers Petechiae Angular stomatitis (fissures in the corners of the mouth). In children with congenital malabsorption disorders, which are rare, neurological problems might also be present.",
    "diagnosing_folate_deficiency": "Diagnosis is based on evaluation of symptoms and blood tests . Although there is no official medical consensus of what level of folate in blood serum indicates a deficiency, most practitioners agree that a level of less than seven nanomoles per liter (7nmol/L) is problematic. Below that level, the risk of megaloblastic anemia is much higher. 3 If a blood test reveals anemia, this will lead to further evaluation of the possible causes, including analyzing serum folate levels. Elevated homocysteine levels can also indicate a folate deficiency and can therefore be part of the laboratory testing . The process of diagnosing a folate deficiency involves the exclusion of other possible causes of the symptoms. In cases where anemia is suspected, other possible causes of anemia , for example iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency , chronic disease and others, must be excluded. Physicians will evaluate the affected person’s diet for signs of insufficient intake, such as might accompany vegan diets, poor diets, or “fad” diets. Often, people with this condition present with a history of alcohol intake which contributes to a poor diet. Other affected people may be pregnant or lactating. Certain drugs, such as anticonvulsants, can also cause this type of deficiency.",
    "causes": "Folate deficiency has a number of potential causes. Most healthy people absorb sufficient folate from their diets to avoid deficiency, but in some cases the body may increase demand, which, if supplementation doesn’t occur, may lead to deficiency. In other cases, the body may be unable to absorb enough folate, due to low intake or excessive excretion. Causes of folate deficiency include: 1 2 3 5 Low dietary intake due to medically restricted diets such as those followed by people with phenylketonuria or due to fad diets concentrating on foods that do not contain enough folate. Infants who are fed unfortified goat’s milk will also experience folate deficiency, as folate is not naturally present in goat’s milk. Malabsorption, which can be due to age, liver problems or gastrointestinal problems causing chronic diarrhoea, such as sprue, celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes of malabsorption are pancreatitis , bariatric surgery and extensive surgery involving the large or small intestine. Malabsorption is also a risk for people who use drugs that interfere with the absorption of folate, such as proton-pump inhibitors, some anticonvulsants such as carbamezapine, phenytoin, valproic acid, and phenobarbitol. 6 Disorders such as leukaemia, carcinomas and lymphomas, , which increase the body’s demand for folate and may consequently lead to deficiency if folic acid supplements aren’t taken. Age, which causes changes in the gastrointestinal systems of people more than 65 years of age. These may lead to reduced absorption and reduced dietary intake. Alcohol-related damage to the liver, which affects the way in which folate is stored in the liver and increases the amount of folate excreted in urine. People with alcohol dependence may also have a nutritionally insufficient diet. Pregnancy and lactation, which raise the body’s demand for folate considerably due to the growth of new tissue in both mother and fetus. Sufficient folic acid supplementation is crucial for pregnant women, as a deficiency may cause birth defects. Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke. 7 Renal dialysis, which affects the amounts of homocysteine in the body and therefore increases the amount of folic acid needed.",
    "risks_for_folate_deficiency": "While folic acid is found in many food and fortified products, some groups of people are more likely to develop a deficiency than others . Pregnant women, people with alcohol use addictions and the elderly are at particular risk. 8\n\nAlcoholism causes physical damage to the body, and one significant element of this is the development of nutritional deficiencies. This is the result of damage to the liver, which uses stored nutrients to process alcohol. Alcohol abuse causes the liver to run out of stored nutrients, causing the body to draw nutrients out of the bloodstream to make up the difference. 9 This can cause deficiencies of Vitamin A, calcium, Vitamin B12 and Vitamin B9, which is also called folic acid or folate. High alcohol concentrations can also directly destroy B vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract. 8 The body’s ability to process nutrients is further compromised as alcohol damages the liver, pancreas and stomach. The ability of the small intestine to absorb nutrients such as folate is also reduced. 10 Furthermore, some people with alcoholism do not eat balanced diets, leading to low nutrient intake. Folate is one of the most important nutrients affected by excessive alcohol use. Folate deficiency can contribute to the development of alcoholic liver disease. 10\n\nFolic acid is vital during pregnancy, as it is required for the growth and development of the fetus. In women, pregnancy increases the risk of folate-deficiency-related anemia because of the effect it has on the mother’s circulatory system. During pregnancy, the mother’s blood volume increases, meaning that plasma levels and red blood cell numbers increase. Folate is needed to produce red blood cells, so pregnant women experience an increased demand for folate. 11 In fetuses, folate is crucial for the proper development of the neural tube. Folic acid also prevents oral clefts and congenital heart disease. 11 Ideally, women who are planning to have a baby should begin to supplement with folic acid before they fall pregnant (see below).\n\nIt is well-established that folic acid levels can have an affect on a person’s mood, social function and cognitive function, especially among older people. 12 Depression is also common in people with folic acid deficiency. Many elderly people have folic acid deficiencies, because of ageing, poor diets linked to reduced income or absorption problems caused by medication. Some older people also develop  an increased demand for folate, for unknown reasons. ref12 Supplementation with B9 for older people may be helpful, and some studies have found that increasing folic acid supplementation in people with low folate levels leads to notable improvements in mood, cognitive function and social functioning. However, it is not advisable to begin taking folate supplements without consulting a physician. This is important because in elderly people with anemia, supplementing with B9 may cover the effects of B12 deficiencies. 13 For more information on B12 deficiencies, see the FAQs below.",
    "complications": "There are several possible health consequences of having folate deficiency. These include:\n\nMegaloblasts are large, poorly-formed red blood cells that form in cases of anemia caused by, among others, folate or B12 deficiencies. Megaloblastic anemia is a result of folate deficiency as well as one of the most easily-identified symptoms: sometimes, a deficiency is only identified when anemia presents. If it results from folate deficiency, this anemia, is treated by taking oral or intravenous folate supplements. 14 For more information on folate-related anemia and B12-related anemia, see FAQs below.\n\nFolic acid is very important in the correct development of cells and is crucial for the correct development of fetuses. Pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant should increase their folic acid intake to 400 micrograms a day. Women should increase their intake to 5mg a day if they are or wish to become pregnant and are affected by the following factors: 15 If a women is affected by diabetes, celiac disease, a BMI of more than 30 or is treated with drugs that affect folate absorption, additional supplementation must be considered. Folic acid deficiency in the mother can cause defects in the neural tube, which is the structure that eventually develops into the baby’s spinal cord. Neural tube defects (NTDs) can include spina bifida, caudal regressive (affecting the lowest part of the spine), and cleft palate. Extremely rare, but severe, complications of folic acid deficiency can include anencephaly and encephaloceles, which involve the baby’s skull and brain. 16",
    "treatment": "In most cases, folate deficiency is relatively easy to correct. In cases where a deficiency has set in due to poor diet or age, taking a folic acid supplement or modifying the diet is sufficient. However, if there is an underlying problem, like alcoholic changes to the liver or a drug interaction or condition causing malabsorption, specialised treatment will be required. The underlying causes of folate deficiency need to be addressed to prevent the problem recurring. Folate deficiency is relatively easily treated in cases where the deficiency is not severe. However, where it has caused anemia, folic acid supplementation and/or correcting diet alone will not be enough. In women with megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency must be ruled out before any folic acid treatment can begin. If complications have occurred, or if there is an underlying condition or factor causing the folate deficiency, the affected person may have to be referred to one or more of the following kinds of doctor: 2 Gastroenterologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum, as well as the pancreas, gallbladder, bile ducts and liver Dietitian, a certified expert on diet and nutrition Hematologist, a doctor specialising in diseases and disorders of the blood\n\nFolate is readily available in many whole foods, such as: 15 Leafy green vegetables such spinach, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts Beetroot Citrus fruits Liver Beans and legumes such as peas, pinto, cannellini, or garbanzo beans/chickpeas=\n\nIn some countries, such as the United States, South Africa, Chile, Canada and Costa Rica, grain cereal products (bread, pasta and breakfast cereals) are fortified with folic acid. 17 This is a major factor in reducing the number of neural tube defects that occur, but it is still recommended that anyone who is at risk of a deficiency, such as pregnant women, should make sure to get 400 micrograms of folate a day. This is especially the case if the following risk factors are present: Celiac disease or other intestinal absorption disorders Thalassemia or sickle cell anemia ; hereditary red blood cell disorders Clinical obesity, a BMI of 30 or more. Family history of, or partner with a family history of, neural tube defects. In this case, folic acid acts as “insurance.” Rapid cell turnover (hemolysis) occuring as a result of chronic hematological disorders 3",
    "folate_deficiency_faqs": "Q: How much folic acid should I take every day? A: The daily need of folic acid differs between adults (200mcg) and people younger than 14 years of age (150-200mcg). It must be emphasized that men, children and women who are not likely to become pregnant obtain a sufficient amount of folate in a healthy diet, containing a wide variety of foods. Pregnant and lactating women need at least 400 micrograms a day and possibly as much as 800mcg. Pregnant and lactating women with diabetes, or a family history of neural tube defects, should consult a specialist for optimum supplementation during pregnancy. 18 Q: How much folic acid is too much? A: The safe upper limit for daily folate/folic acid intake is 1000 micrograms a day. Beyond this, there might be adverse effects. 19 Not much is known about the long-term adverse effects of exceeding the upper limit, if any. 20 It has been suggested that taking too much folic acid is particularly risky for elderly people, because taking large amounts of B9 can mask the symptoms of a Vitamin B12 deficiency. Q: Can folic acid deficiency cause diarrhea? A: Yes, it can. Folic acid deficiency can cause a range of gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea, stomach pain, and indigestion. Folic acid deficiency can lead to weight loss because of causing lack of appetite. Q: How does taking extra folate affect a Vitamin B12 deficiency? A: Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause severe neurological damage. It can also cause megaloblastic anemia. Taking supplemental doses of Vitamin B9 does make it look like the B12 deficiency is being cured, because it can increase the number of red blood cells in the body, which improves the anemia. But it does not cure the deficiency, and the neurological damage caused by the B12 deficiency will continue. It is possible that taking extra Vitamin B9 in cases of Vitamin B12 deficiency can worsen the severity of the B12 deficiency, but this is not known for certain. It is best to consult a physician if there is any possibility of a B12 deficiency. 14 Q: Is folate supplementation safe for people with cancer? A: It is not known for certain whether supplementation with folic acid is safe for people with cancer. Some studies suggest that folic acid reduces the chance of developing cancer and accelerates the progression of certain types of cancer; other studies suggest the opposite. 12 It is best to consult specialist physicians and/or oncological caregivers before beginning supplementation. Q: What sort of anemia results from a deficiency of Vitamin B12? A: The type of anemia that results from a vitamin B12 deficiency is known as pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia can also be caused by a deficiency of folic acid. In B12-related anemia, low levels of B12 affect the body’s ability to make red blood cells, resulting in anemia. Q: What causes B12-related anemia, also known as pernicious anemia? A: In some people, low B12 levels happen because they cannot absorb B12 from food due to a lack of a substance known as intrinsic factor in the stomach. Other causes of low B12 levels include infections, surgery, some medications or diet, all of which can affect the amount of B12 that the body can absorb. 21 B12-related anemia can affect anybody, but is most prevalent among people with English, Irish, Scottish or Scandinavian heritage and people between the ages of 40 and 70. It is as likely to affect men as it is women. 22 Causes of B12-related anemia include: 21 Celiac disease Crohn’s disease HIV infection Some types of medication for diabetes or epilepsy Antibiotics that affect the gut’s bioflora, as bacteria use the B12 before the host can absorb it Surgical removal of part of the small intestine Alcoholism Tapeworm infection, as the parasite uses the B12 before the host can absorb it A diet low in B12 Strict vegetarians and vegans are at increased risk of developing B12-related anemia because of their diets. Foods that are rich in B12 are animal products such as beef, fish, eggs and dairy products. 21 B12 anemia can also affect the babies of breastfeeding women who are strict vegetarians or vegans. However, in certain countries, many cereals and grain products are enriched with B12. Q: What are the symptoms of B12-related anemia? A: Symptoms of B12-related anemia include: Weight loss and loss of appetite Increased heart rate A painful, smooth, red and slightly swollen tongue Low-grade fever Weakness Clumsiness Hearing loss or vision loss Tingling in the extremities Unsteady gait/walk Gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, flatulence or heartburn. If the affected person is experiencing severe abdominal pain , a doctor should be consulted as soon as possible, as this indicates a severe B12 deficiency. In older people, a B12 deficiency may also cause Memory loss Irritability Personality changes Q: How does megaloblastic anemia differ from other anemias? A: Anemia occurs when an individual has too few or deformed red blood cells (erythrocytes). For example, anemia can occur when an individual’s iron levels are too low, e.g. when they are undergoing chemotherapy, or when they have kidney disease. Megaloblastic anemia is also known as Vitamin B12-related anemia, folate-related anemia, or macrocytic anemia. It occurs when the body produces short-lived, large, poorly-developed red blood cells. 15 These blood cells cannot move out of the bone marrow where they develop, due to their shape. As a result, there are too few red blood cells in the blood, leaving the affected person feeling weak and fatigued. Other types of anemia are hemolytic anemia, a subtype of hemolytic anemia known as sickle-cell anemia , and aplastic anemia. Hemolytic anemia can be inherited, as in the case of thalassemia or glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. It can also be caused by autoimmune disorders, infections or leaky heart valves. It occurs when red blood cells break up in the blood vessels or the spleen. 23 Sickle-cell anemia is hereditary and causes rigid red blood cells that do not readily flow through the blood vessels. Aplastic anemia occurs when the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells, often when the body’s immune system attacks it."

    "what_is_a_food_allergy": "A food allergy develops if the body’s immune system produces an abnormal response to one or more proteins contained in food. 1 This will often lead to unpleasant symptoms, commonly including itching or swelling of the mouth, a raised rash, and vomiting . Food allergies are very common, with 15 million people in the USA alone estimated to be affected by a food allergy of some kind. 2 Any type of food can cause an allergy. However, 90 percent of all allergic reactions to food are caused by 8 foods or food groups : 3 Milk Eggs Fish Shellfish, such as crab, lobster, and prawns Wheat Soy Peanuts Tree nuts, such as Brazilian nuts, almonds, and walnuts\n\nThere are several different types of food allergy, each defined by which part of the immune system is causing the response. 4 While most allergic reactions to food are mild, in some cases, a severe response, known as anaphylaxis , can occur. In cases such as these, urgent medical attention is required.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Symptoms of a food allergy can appear within a few minutes to a number of hours after eating food containing the allergen . They can range from mild to severe, and, if anaphylaxis occurs, symptoms may even be life-threatening. Symptoms are also unpredictable and subject to change. What appears to be a mild reaction could become severe very quickly, or a food that causes a mild reaction in one instance could cause a severe reaction when eaten again. 5\n\nSymptoms of a mild to moderate allergic reaction to food include: 1 4 5 A tingling and/or itching sensation in the mouth Swelling of the lips, tongue, and/or throat Swelling of the face, particularly around the eyes A rash or hives, which may be raised, red, itchy, and blotchy Nausea and/or vomiting Wheezing and/or breathlessness Stomach pain Diarrhea Nasal congestion and/or a runny nose Sneezing and/or dry coughing Lightheadedness An unfamiliar, strange, or metallic taste in the mouth People experiencing an allergic reaction to food may develop one or more of these symptoms.\n\nThe following symptoms may be a sign of a severe food allergy , otherwise known as anaphylaxis. These symptoms may be combined with symptoms of a milder allergic reaction and, in all instances, require immediate treatment. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include: 5 6 Difficulty swallowing and/or speaking Turning blue and/or generalised flushing A drop in blood pressure, which may cause faintness, confusion, and/or weakness Chest pain Heart rate alterations Abdominal pain , nausea, and/or vomiting A sense of impending doom Loss of consciousness There are two main ways in which these symptoms may occur: 6 Monophasic. Symptoms appear quickly and worsen rapidly. Once treatment has been received, however, symptoms will disappear and not return. Biphasic. Mild to severe symptoms will appear before disappearing for a period of time. This will usually be a couple of hours but can be as long as 72 hours. After this period, symptoms will return and typically include breathing and blood pressure symptoms. Whether the anaphylaxis is monophasic or biphasic, urgent medical attention is required. In most cases, a stay in the hospital will be required for observation.\n\nAllergic reactions to food are either caused by the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) or are non-IgE-mediated. This is covered in further detail in the causes section below. IgE reactions are the most common, causing the symptoms described above. Rarer, non-IgE-mediated reactions can cause different symptoms, including: 1 Atopic dermatitis Acid reflux Loose and/or frequent stools Constipation Mucus or blood in the stool Redness of the anus Tiredness Paleness Poor growth in children People experiencing a non-IgE-mediated allergic reaction may present one or more of these symptoms, which may range from mild to severe.",
    "food_allergy_causes": "The immune system helps to protect the body against infection and illness. If it detects a perceived threat, it releases proteins, known as antibodies, to neutralize it. Most food allergies are caused by the immune system mistakenly releasing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE) to combat harmless proteins in food. This is a type-I-allergic reaction. IgE triggers the production of several chemicals, including histamine, the chemical responsible for most of the physical symptoms experienced during an allergic reaction. 7 The production of histamine is usually limited to certain locations, such as the areas around the mouth or throat. When the immune system produces large amounts of histamine and releases it into the blood, this causes anaphylaxis.\n\nIgE causes the majority of allergic reactions to food. In some cases, however, a reaction can be non-IgE-mediated, something known as a type-III-allergic reaction. These types of reactions are caused by the immune system releasing different types of antibodies that activate cells, such as granulocytes, a type of white blood cell. Non-IgE-mediated reactions tend to be less severe and less immediate. They are also typically limited to the skin and digestive system, causing symptoms such as heartburn and indigestion in adults, and diarrhea and acid reflux in babies.\n\nAny type of food can provoke an allergic reaction . In the United States, however , 90 percent of all allergic reactions to food are caused by 8 foods or food groups . These are: 3 Milk Eggs Fish Shellfish, such as crab, lobster, and prawns Wheat Soy Peanuts Tree nuts, such as brazil nuts, almond,s and walnuts Other foods associated with allergic reactions include: 7 Sesame seeds Celery, celery seeds, celery salt, and celeriac Gluten Mustard Fruits and vegetables Meat Pine nuts\n\nPrecisely why some people develop food allergies and others do not is not known. Certain factors that increase a person’s likelihood of developing a food allergy, however, have been identified. Risk factors for food allergies include: 7\n\nA person has a higher likelihood of developing a food allergy if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has an allergic condition. This allergic condition does not necessarily have to be a food allergy, it could also be a condition like asthma or eczema . Despite this link having been made, precisely which genes cause allergic reactions remains unknown.\n\nChildren who have allergic conditions, such as eczema or asthma, are more likely to develop a food allergy later in life. This is also true when reversed: children with a food allergy are more likely to develop another allergic condition, such as eczema or asthma. The precise reason for this is not known. It is not the case, however, that one condition causes the other. It is more likely that the conditions have a number of shared risk factors.",
    "food_allergy_diagnosis": "People who suspect that they may have a food allergy should consult a doctor as soon as possible. The initial step will involve the doctor asking a number of questions about the pattern of symptoms being experienced. Questions may include: 1 7 What symptoms have you experienced? What food do you suspect caused the allergic reaction? How long after eating the food did symptoms occur? How much of the food was consumed? How was the food prepared? Could, for example, another ingredient be causing the reaction? Further questions about a person’s medical history may include: Is there a family history of allergic conditions? Do you have any other allergic conditions? Eczema or asthma, for example. Depending on the answers to these questions and a physical examination, the doctor may order a number of tests. Alternatively, the affected person will be referred to a specialist, usually an allergist or gastroenterologist, for further investigation. Tests may include: 1 7\n\nThis test involves pricking or scratching the skin with a small probe coated with extracts of certain foods. This will usually be carried out on the forearm and is not usually painful. The foods used will generally be whatever is suspected of causing the reaction, as well as other common food allergens and common non-food allergens, such as pollen. Redness, itchiness and/or swelling will signal a positive reaction. Due to the small size of the area tested, these symptoms will not usually cause any significant discomfort.\n\nBlood tests can be used to measure the number of allergic antibodies in the blood. Blood tests do not need to be carried out by an allergy specialist, but a specialist may be required to interpret the results. This type of test may be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with a skin-prick test. Other methods used to diagnose a food allergy may include:\n\nA food elimination diet involves withdrawing the food thought to be causing the allergic reaction for a period of time, usually two to six weeks, before reintroducing it. If the symptoms disappear during the period of withdrawal and return when the food is reintroduced, this will give a strong indication of the source of the allergy. A food elimination diet should only be undertaken under the supervision of a doctor or allergy specialist. Completely eliminating a whole food group from one’s diet has the potential for adverse effects, including malnutrition in children. Professionals will be able to advise on how best to handle the dietary changes. During the diet, food labels should be carefully read prior to eating. The food being avoided may not be an obvious ingredient of a certain dish, so it is important to be diligent. If eating at a restaurant, the affected person should ask a member of staff about ingredients before ordering.\n\nA healthcare provider may request that a food diary be kept. This should include all food and drinks consumed over a period of time, including things such as condiments and candies. This will help both the people affected and their doctors to build up a clearer picture of what may be causing the allergic reaction.\n\nIf, after testing, a diagnosis is unclear, or if it is suspected that an allergy may have naturally resolved, a process of medically supervised gradual feeding, or a food challenge, may be recommended. This may also be the case if it is thought that a person is only allergic to a food heated or cooked in a certain way. To begin, the person will be given a very small amount of the suspected allergen. They will then be supervised for a period of 10 to 30 minutes. If no reaction occurs, another, slightly larger amount of the food will be given and they will be supervised once again. This process is usually continued for around 90 minutes. If any allergic reaction occurs, the challenge is immediately halted. A food challenge should only be carried out under the supervision of medical professionals.\n\nThere are a number of home allergy testing kits available on the market, including Vega tests, kinesiology tests, and hair tests. The science behind these tests is unproven, and they are unable to provide a definitive diagnosis. They should, therefore, be avoided, and a doctor be consulted instead.",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_food_allergy": "The only completely effective way of managing a food allergy is to avoid the allergen completely. To do this, affected people should carefully check food packaging for the included ingredients. As a result of the Food Allergy Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, all food manufacturers in the US are required by law to declare, in easy-to-understand language, the presence of any potential allergens. 8 When eating out, extra care should be taken. Always inform restaurant staff of any allergy, and ensure that the chef responsible for your food is also made aware. The staff should be able to advise on which dishes are suitable and which are not. 8\n\nIn the event of an allergic reaction, there are two main types of medication available to relieve symptoms: antihistamines and adrenaline. 7\n\nThe symptoms of the majority of allergic reactions are caused by histamines. Antihistamines block the effects of the chemical, making them an effective treatment method, especially for milder allergic reactions. Many types of antihistamines are available at pharmacies without a prescription. Always be sure to read and follow the enclosed instructions.\n\nAdrenaline is able to reverse the effects of a severe allergic reaction by opening the airways, reducing swelling, and maintaining heart function and blood pressure. Older children and adults with allergies are often required to carry an adrenaline-containing auto-injector with them at all times. The auto-injector acts as the first line of response in the event of an allergic reaction. Additionally, the emergency services should always be contacted. People required to carry an auto-injector will be taught how to use the device. Generally, this is done by removing the cap, holding the injector firmly against the thigh, and waiting for a clicking-sound that indicates that the injector has been activated. People who are required to carry an adrenaline auto-injector should: 7 Carry their device at all times. Be careful not to leave the device somewhere it may be exposed to extreme temperatures, such as a fridge or a hot car. This can lessen the effectiveness of adrenaline. Regularly check the device’s expiry date. Use the device as soon as symptoms of an allergic reaction occur. Even if symptoms are mild, do not hesitate to use the auto-injector.\n\nGlucocorticoids, a type of steroid hormone, are used to treat people experiencing anaphylaxis. They are usually administered intravenously after the affected person has been resuscitated in order to help relieve symptoms. 9 Despite common use, there is no consensus on whether glucocorticoids are effective.",
    "food_allergy_prevention": "Although there are a number of proposals surrounding the prevention of food allergies, research into the area is still evolving. The role of breastfeeding and the timing of first contact with potential allergens remains the central focus of most current thinking around prevention. A 2013 study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, suggests that introducing solid foods to very young babies can trigger the onset of food allergies. Consequently, the report recommends breastfeeding for as long as possible. 8 Another study, conducted by the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), focussed specifically on peanut allergies. The study took a group of infants, all of whom were at a high risk of developing a peanut allergy. It found that the children who were introduced to peanuts and regularly ate food containing peanuts before the age of 1 had an 81 percent lower chance of developing a peanut allergy than those who were not. Despite this research, it is still advised that parents talk to a healthcare provider before taking any steps to try and prevent the onset of food allergies.",
    "food_allergy_faqs": "Q: Should I perform a food allergy test at home? A: No, the use of home allergy testing kits is not recommended. The science behind these kits is dubious, and they are generally unreliable. People concerned that they may have a food allergy should visit a doctor for proper diagnosis. Q: What are the symptoms of food allergies in babies and children? A: Mild symptoms of a food allergy in babies and children may include: 10 11 A flushed face Hives or a red rash around the eyes, mouth and tongue, which may spread to other parts of the body Swelling of the lips, the area around the eyes and the face Sneezing, watering eyes and a blocked or runny nose Nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea An itchy or scratchy throat and mouth More severe symptoms requiring urgent medical attention may include: Shortness of breath, wheezing or chest tightness Swelling of the tongue and/or throat, which may cause breathing difficulties A sharp drop in blood pressure, which may cause dizziness, confusion and loss of consciousness A severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, can be life-threatening. Urgent medical attention is required if one or more of these symptoms arises. Q: Are allergic reactions to food immediate? A: The speed at which the symptoms of an allergic reaction to food develop can vary. Reactions triggered by the release of the antibody immunoglobulin E (IgE) tend to come on fairly quickly, usually within a number of minutes to two hours. 1 Non-IgE-mediated allergic reactions, however, tend to come on more slowly. This can be anywhere between a couple of hours and a number of days after the allergen has been consumed. 12 Q: Are food allergy blood tests accurate? A: Blood tests can be extremely useful to doctors and allergists trying to ascertain whether or not a person has a food allergy. However, they are not always accurate. In 50 to 60 percent of cases, blood tests will return a false-positive result. 13 This means, the results will show that a person has a food allergy, when in fact they do not. For this reason, a variety of diagnostic methods are likely to be used before a definitive diagnosis is given."

    "condition": "Foreign Body Aspiration",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/foreign-body-aspiration/",
    "what_is_foreign_body_aspiration": "Foreign body aspiration, also known as pulmonary aspiration, occurs when an object is accidentally inhaled into a person’s airways. This usually results in an obstruction of a specific area of the respiratory tract, such as: 1 The larynx. Also known as the voice box, the larynx is part of the throat and located in the neck The trachea. Also known as the windpipe, the trachea connects the larynx to the bronchi The bronchi. Two passageways, each individually known as a bronchus, which carry air from the trachea into the lungs Foreign bodies that are commonly aspirated are usually small in size and can be either an edible item, such as a nut or raisin, or a non-edible item such as a coin or marble. Children under the age of three are most likely to experience a foreign body aspiration, although it can happen at any age. 2 Typically, a foreign body aspiration causes respiratory symptoms such as: 1 2 3 Choking Coughing Difficulty breathing and/or abnormal breathing sounds\n\nThe precise symptoms experienced and severity of the condition depend on how large the blockage is, as well as precisely where in the airways it has settled. Often, an affected person shows initial signs of choking and coughing and will then subsequently begin to display other respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing or recurrent coughing. 2 3 However, in the most severe cases, foreign body aspiration can become life-threatening. For this reason, all cases of a foreign body in the airways should be treated as a medical emergency. ref3 Initial treatment usually focuses on managing the person’s ability to breathe properly, before moving onto removal of the foreign body. If the object is not removed, later complications can include swelling and infection to the area of the airways surrounding the object. 4",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms experienced during a foreign body aspiration are variable and usually depend on three main factors: 1 2 Where in the airways the object has settled. Most foreign bodies settle in the bronchi, which is considered a lower airway obstruction. Obstructions higher up in the airways, such as in the larynx or trachea,  are typically more severe The size and nature of the foreign body inhaled. Whether it is big or small, sharp or blunt, hard or soft The time since the object was inhaled. Whether the aspiration has only just taken place, if it occurred within the last few days or weeks, or further in the past\n\nImmediate symptoms to look out for that may indicate a foreign body aspiration include: 1 2 5 6 Choking Coughing Difficulty breathing and shortness of breath Difficulty speaking Wheezing or stridor. Stridor is a particular kind of wheeze that often produces a loud, single-pitch noise, usually during inhalation. A wheeze is a high-pitched, continuous sound, usually heard during exhalation Bluish tinge to the skin Any symptoms experienced will typically occur immediately after the foreign body has been inhaled. If the blockage to the airways is significant enough, symptoms may occur in quick succession, become severe and can eventually lead to loss of consciousness and even death, unless the object is dislodged. 7 In milder cases, where the obstruction is less significant, the symptoms experienced may be less severe. 7 However, anyone who is displaying immediate symptoms of having inhaled a foreign body should still seek emergency help.\n\nIf the affected person is displaying immediate choking symptoms, it can be useful to distinguish between the signs of a mild or significant obstruction . If the person is experiencing a mild obstruction , they are often able to: 5 Breathe Talk Cough Be responsive and answer questions More severe obstructions in the airways may be indicated by: An inability to breathe An inability to speak or properly vocalise Coughs that are particularly quiet or silent Blushing tinge to the skin Loss of consciousness\n\nIn general, upper airway obstructions in the larynx and trachea tend to be more severe than obstructions in the bronchi or lower airway. 2 5 8 If abnormal breathing sounds such as wheezing or stridor are present, this may help to indicate whether the person has an upper or lower airway obstruction. Stridor is a loud, single-pitch noise, usually heard during inhalation. It is typically a sign of an upper airway obstruction. A wheeze is a high-pitched, continuous sound, usually heard during exhalation and is more often a sign of a lower airway obstruction. ref2 6\n\nPeople who have a mild obstruction in the airways may initially exhibit some of the immediate symptoms above, but can then move into an asymptomatic phase. During this time, the foreign body is still lodged in the airways, but the reflexes have relaxed, and symptoms such as difficulty breathing or coughing have reduced. This phase can last from a few hours up to a number of weeks. 1 However, after a period of time, other symptoms might become apparent. This is because even a mild case of foreign body aspiration is likely to cause health complications in the future. As most complications occur as a result of delayed diagnosis, it is recommended that a person with suspected foreign body aspiration seeks medical attention immediately, even if they are in an asymptomatic phase. 9 After the asymptomatic phase, further indications that an object has been inhaled may include: 1 2 5 Recurrent cough Wheezing or stridor Fever Persistent difficulty swallowing",
    "causes": "A foreign body aspiration is caused when a person inhales a foreign object into their airways. This is most often done by accident, usually while eating or when a non-edible object is placed in the mouth. Food is the most frequently aspirated type of object, with nuts and seeds being particularly common. 7 Raisins, grapes and sweets are other food items which are often seen aspirated. Liquids, such as water, can also be inhaled into the airways. In addition to edible objects, other non-edible items which are commonly retrieved from the airways include: 2 10 ref6 Balloons can be particularly dangerous when inhaled and account for roughly 29 percent of aspiration deaths in children 11 Other small toys, such as marbles Coins Pins Dental appliances, such as crowns, fillings and orthodontic retainers 12",
    "risk_factors_for_foreign_body_aspiration": "Age is a primary risk factor for foreign body aspiration, and approximately 80 percent of instances occur in young children under the age of three years old. 2 This is due to a number of reasons, including: 4 7 13 Children are much more likely to place foreign objects in their mouth Young children may not yet have their molar teeth, which can result in a reduced ability to chew their food down sufficiently Young children usually have slightly smaller airways than adults, making them more prone to obstruction However, foreign body aspiration can occur at any age. According to one study, the median age for foreign body aspiration in adults is 60 years old. 7 In adults, foreign body aspiration usually occurs while eating. 2 Other risk factors for foreign body aspiration include: 5 7 Wearing oral appliances, such as an orthodontic retainer or mouthpiece Intoxication Sedation Neurological disorders, such as dementia or Parkinson’s disease Psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder . In these cases, foreign body aspiration may be a deliberate act, although the motivation behind it is often unclear 14 Eating high-risk foods, such as nuts, seeds, sweets and small fruits Medical conditions or procedures that may impair the swallowing reflex, such as throat surgery 7",
    "diagnosing_foreign_body_aspiration": "Rapid diagnosis is extremely important for foreign body aspiration, because a significant obstruction in the airways that is restricting breathing can quickly become life-threatening. After assessing the symptoms, if a doctor suspects a significant airway obstruction, emergency treatment will likely be sought to remove the object, without any further need for imaging tests. 2 However, if the affected person is stable and displaying symptoms of a mild or historic foreign body aspiration, further tests may be recommended before treatment.\n\nA doctor might choose to perform a physical examination first, which can include: 2 7 Checking breathing function Checking speech and voice function Checking physical appearance, including for signs of any bluish tinge to the skin Vital signs tests, such as pulse, blood pressure and temperature readings Pulse oximetry, a non-invasive test which monitors the levels of oxygen in the blood\n\nIf foreign body aspiration is still suspected, a doctor may recommend an imaging test in order to gain an internal view of the body. An X-ray is usually the first imaging test suggested. 2 This non-invasive method uses electromagnetic radiation and can often detect the presence of foreign bodies in the airways. However, not all objects are visible on radiograph tests such as X-rays. If an X-ray is inconclusive, a CT scan may then be recommended. 2 This test is also non-invasive and uses powerful X-rays to generate a more detailed image of the inside of the body. As well as detecting the presence of a foreign body in the airways, imaging tests may also be able to identify certain possible complications of the aspiration, such as any collapse of a lung. 15\n\nIf imaging tests are inconclusive, a bronchoscopy might be suggested to help diagnose a foreign body aspiration. During a bronchoscopy, a long, thin tube called a bronchoscope is typically inserted through the mouth to gain an internal view of the airways. The bronchoscope has a light source and camera on one end, which allows the doctor to see areas such as the larynx, trachea and bronchi up close. 16 In the case of foreign body aspiration, a bronchoscopy can either be used diagnostically, to confirm the presence and location of a foreign body in the airways, or as a treatment method to physically remove the item.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of foreign body aspiration involves managing the person's ability to breathe and removing the foreign body. It is extremely important to respond quickly if the affected person has a significant obstruction that is affecting their ability to breathe, as this can quickly become life-threatening.\n\nIf an airway obstruction is suspected, it is important to deliver first aid quickly. Both mild and severe choking can be successfully treated at the scene, and this should take precedence over immediately calling for emergency medical care. 17 18 When someone is displaying signs of choking, the following steps can be used to help remove the object: 18 19 20 Encourage the person to keep coughing. If the obstruction is mild, they are usually able to cough and clear the blockage themselves. Back blows. If the person is unable to cough, or coughing is unsuccessful, lean the person slightly forward and give up to five sharps blows to their back, between the shoulder blades. Deliver these blows with the heel of one hand, while supporting the person’s chest with the other hand. Abdominal thrusts/Heimlich Maneuver. If back blows are unsuccessful, give up to five abdominal thrusts. Stand behind and slightly to the side of the person and wrap both arms around their waist. Clench a fist with one hand, cover it with the other hand, and pull sharply inwards and upwards just above their navel. If the above measures are unsuccessful, call for emergency medical help and then continue alternating between back blows and abdominal thrusts until assistance arrives. If the person becomes unconscious, lay them on a flat surface and begin to deliver cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), even if a pulse is present.\n\nIf further attempts at first aid are unsuccessful and once medical help arrives, an emergency endotracheal intubation may be attempted. This process involves passing a flexible tube, known as an endotracheal tube, through the person’s mouth and into the airways. The tube can assist in opening the airways to provide oxygen and can also be used to remove blockages. 2 21 In the most severe cases of choking, an emergency tracheotomy may be performed. A tracheotomy involves creating a small opening at the front of the neck. A tube is then inserted through this opening into the trachea, helping the person to breathe. 2 22\n\nPeople who have milder cases of foreign body aspiration may not require emergency medical treatment. However, prompt treatment is usually still necessary, because a foreign body in the airways can quickly cause other health complications , such as a respiratory infection like pneumonia.\n\nRemoval of the foreign body during a bronchoscopy is a common, and usually successful, treatment method for inhaled objects located in the trachea or bronchi. 2 A bronchoscope is a long, thin tube with a camera and light source on one end. This tube can be flexible or rigid and is inserted into a person’s airways to access and look into the respiratory tract. A bronchoscopy is typically performed under general anesthesia, although local anesthesia and/or sedatives may be used for more simple procedures. 23 As well as helping to locate the foreign body, certain surgical instruments, such as forceps or a suction pad can be attached to the bronchoscope to enable removal of the object. Once the item is removed, the doctor will usually return the bronchoscope to the airway to ensure no fragments of the foreign body remain. 9 If the object is located in the larynx, a similar treatment method known as a laryngoscopy may be used instead. 9\n\nSurgical removal is rarely necessary for foreign body aspiration. 2 However, if the inhaled item is particularly large, sharp or difficult to remove, surgery may be required. 9 A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making a small opening in the front of a person’s neck, known as a tracheostomy, in order to access the trachea. Removal of an aspirated foreign body located in this region can then be attempted through the surgical opening. Tracheotomies are usually performed under general anesthetic, meaning the patient is unconscious. 24 25 A thoracotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision between a person’s ribs, in order to open the chest and access the lungs. This is also performed under general anesthesia and is usually only suggested if the foreign body is located in the bronchi, and bronchoscopic attempts to remove the foreign body have been unsuccessful. 9 26 27\n\nMedication is typically not prescribed to treat foreign body aspirations. However, antibiotics may be prescribed to target any bacterial infections that arise as a result of the condition. 9",
    "preventing_foreign_body_aspiration": "Because foreign body aspiration occurs most commonly in children under the age of three, it is important to educate caregivers about the condition, so they can help prevent the children in their care inhaling small objects. Preventive suggestions include: 10 4 28 29 Keep small objects that may be a choking hazard, such as coins, buttons and marbles, away from children Teach children not to place foreign objects in their mouth, nose or other body openings Avoid giving children under three years of age high-risk foods, such as nuts, seeds, small fruits and sweets Avoid talking, laughing or playing while eating Avoid running or exercising while eating Although common in children, foreign body inhalation can occur to anyone at any age. Avoid putting non-edible objects into the mouth, and always take care to eat slowly.",
    "complications": "In the most severe cases of foreign body aspiration, the inhaled object can cause choking, and impaired breathing function. Unless the object is urgently removed, the condition may become fatal. If a person is suspected to be choking, urgent treatment such as back blows and abdominal thrusts are required to help remove the foreign body and prevent any further complications. 4 28\n\nFor foreign bodies that remain in the airways, urgent removal is usually necessary as most complications arise as a result of delayed diagnosis. Approximately 67 percent of people with a  foreign body obstruction in the larynx or trachea who do not undergo removal within 24 hours experience complications. 9 The appearance and severity of any complications depend on the size, nature and location of the foreign object inhaled.\n\nPneumonia is a potentially severe infection that causes swelling to the tissue in one or both of the lungs. There are various types of pneumonia, and the term <em>aspiration pneumonia</em> specifically relates to bacterial pneumonia caused by breathing food or stomach contents into the lungs. 30 The most common symptom of pneumonia is a wet cough that often produces mucus. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain and a fever. Aspiration pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics. 31\n\nAspiration pneumonitis is a chemical injury to the lungs that occurs when food, stomach contents or a foreign body is breathed all the way into the lungs. Various substances, including gastric acid, can cause a chemical burn to the airways and/or lungs, resulting in swelling and symptoms such as sudden shortness of breath and coughing. A fever may also be present. 31 If severe, aspiration pneumonitis can potentially lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. 32 Because the injury is chemical rather than bacterial, antibiotics are usually not effective at treating aspiration pneumonitis. Instead, doctors may suggest oxygen therapy, assistance from a breathing machine or clearing the foreign body from the airways using a bronchoscope. 31\n\nOther potential complications that can occur as a result of foreign body aspiration include: 2 10 28 33 34 Atelectasis, where the air sacs in the lung, also known as alveoli, collapse and cannot expand properly Pneumothorax , where air accumulates in the area between the lung and chest wall, causing a partial or full collapse of the lung. This condition is sometimes known as a collapsed lung Pneumomediastinum, which is the abnormal presence of air in the mediastinum, the space between the two lungs Bronchiectasis, a long-term condition that leads to excess mucus in the lungs Lung abscess, a pus-filled cavity in the lungs surrounded by inflamed tissue, often caused by a bacterial infection Emphysema, a lung condition that can cause shortness of breath Brain damage, resulting from lack of oxygen to the brain Injury to the abdomen and ribs is sometimes caused by the delivery of abdominal thrusts. People who receive abdominal thrusts may require further examination by a doctor to rule out any internal injuries, such as rib fractures or tears to the stomach. 35",

    "foreign_body_aspiration_faqs": "Q: What are the main symptoms of foreign body aspiration? A: When a person experiences an obstructed airway due to inhaling a foreign object, they may experience some or all of the following symptoms: Choking Coughing Difficulty breathing and/or abnormal breath sounds such as wheezing Difficulty speaking Bluish tinge to the skin The severity of the symptoms depends on the size, nature and location of the inhaled object. In mild cases, the affected person may move into an asymptomatic phase, where no symptoms are present despite the object still being settled in the airways. However, this stage is usually temporary, and symptoms that may arise after a period of time include recurrent coughing, fever and difficulty swallowing. Q: Can a foreign body be aspirated into the lungs? A: Yes. An object inhaled into the airways can cause an obstruction in the bronchi, which are the two passageways that deliver air into the lungs. Foreign bodies can also become lodged in the larynx/voice box and the trachea/windpipe. Q: What treatment options are there for removal of a foreign body? A: The treatment method used to remove a foreign body depends on the object’s size, nature and exact location in the respiratory tract. First aid can often be administered during a choking episode, by encouraging the affected person to cough or by delivering back blows and abdominal thrusts. If medical help is required to remove the foreign body, the most common treatment method is a bronchoscopy. This is usually performed under general anesthetic and entails a long, thin tube called a bronchoscope, being inserted into the airways to access the respiratory tract and remove the foreign body. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary. Q: What are the after effects of choking? A: Choking is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. However, if the foreign object is successfully removed from the airways, usually no further medical attention is needed. If any signs of further irritation do occur, such as persistent coughing, pain or discomfort, medical attention should be sought. Q: Does foreign body aspiration happen to both children and adults? A: Yes, anyone at any age can accidentally inhale a foreign body into the airways. However, the condition is most common in children under the age of three years old. Q: What is the difference between foreign body aspiration and foreign body ingestion? A: Foreign body aspiration occurs when a foreign body is inhaled into the airways, whereas a foreign body ingestion occurs when a foreign body is swallowed into the digestive tract. The two conditions have completely different symptoms, treatments and complications. Read more about Foreign Body Ingestion »"

    "what_is_foreign_body_ingestion": "Foreign body ingestion most often occurs when a non-edible object is swallowed and enters the digestive tract. However, the condition can also refer to edible items that become lodged before reaching the stomach. It can be a medical emergency, depending on the object swallowed. Around 80 percent of foreign body ingestions pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing any symptoms or complications at all. 1 Items that are small and rounded, such as coins, buttons and marbles, are the least likely to cause complications when swallowed. However, if the foreign body that has been swallowed is large, sharp or toxic, urgent medical intervention can be required. 2 Objects, which are more likely to cause complications when ingested, include: Batteries Magnets Toothpicks Other sharp objects Symptoms relating to foreign body ingestion tend to vary, depending on the object swallowed and exactly where in the digestive tract it is. Signs that a foreign body has been swallowed and is causing a problem may include pain in the throat or chest, a lump in the throat or chest, and difficulty swallowing. 3 Feeling unwell?

Treatment depends on the object swallowed, where in the digestive tract it is and whether or not the object is likely to pass through the body of its own accord. Although some objects can cause severe consequences, the majority of people who swallow a foreign body will recover without complications.",
    "symptoms": "If the foreign body that has been ingested is small, blunt and non-toxic, it may pass through the entire digestive tract without causing any health problems or symptoms. Such objects generally pass through the gastrointestinal system within four to six days, although the precise time frame can depend on additional factors, such as the person’s metabolism, as well as the item swallowed. 1 If the object is large or sharp, it might get stuck in a specific area of the digestive tract, such as the: 2 Esophagus, the muscular tube that carries food and drink from the throat down to the stomach Stomach, the internal organ that uses enzymes and acids to help break food down into smaller pieces Small and large intestines, the long tubes that absorb the nutrients and water from food, before turning all remaining waste material into stool Rectum, the final section of the large intestine where the body stores stool before defecation Good to know: The digestive tract covers a large area of the human body. Therefore, symptoms of a foreign body ingestion depend not only on what has been ingested, but also where the foreign object is currently located. If you are concerned you or a loved one may have ingested a foreign object, you can use the Ada app to carry out a free symptom assessment.\n\nWhen the foreign body that has been ingested does become stuck, it most often lodges in the esophagus. In approximately 75 percent of pediatric cases, the foreign object becomes lodged in the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which is the muscular barrier at the top of the esophagus that opens and closes to allow food to pass from the throat into the digestive tract. In adults, 70 percent of obstructions occur in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is the muscular barrier that prevents the stomach contents from travelling back up the esophagus. 3 When a foreign body ingestion affects the esophagus, symptoms commonly include: 1 2 3 4 Difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia Sensation of a lump in the throat, neck or chest, if the object is blunt Pain in the throat, neck or chest, if the object is sharp Gagging, retching and vomiting Wheezing and coughing Drooling or spitting due to excess saliva in the mouth Blood-stained saliva Loss of appetite\n\nIf the foreign body passes through the esophagus, but then gets stuck in the stomach or intestines, the following symptoms may be present: 2 4 5 Pain or cramping in the abdomen Abdominal swelling or bloating Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Fever Blood in the stool Diarrhea or constipation\n\nIf a small, blunt foreign body reaches the rectum without issue, it will often be passed out in the stool without complication. However, if it is sharp and pierces the rectum, symptoms may include: 2 3 Sharp pain during bowel movements Blood in the stool Worried you may be experiencing symptoms of a foreign body ingestion? You can use the free Ada app to take a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The most common cause of a foreign body ingestion is when a person unintentionally or unknowingly swallows an object which is either too large, sharp or toxic to pass through the digestive tract without causing potential harm. Because they often use their mouth to explore the world around them and aren’t aware of the related risks, children are more likely to experience this condition than adults. Foreign body ingestion can occur at any age, but is most often seen in children aged between six months and four years old. 6 Repeated foreign body ingestion in children can be an indication of neglect or a disruptive home environment. 4 On occasion, foreign bodies are ingested deliberately. Such behavior is often the result of a mental health issue, learning impairment, a means of protest or to hide an object, e.g. drug smuggling. 2 3\n\nEdible, as well as non-edible, objects can be classed as a foreign body. A food-related obstruction typically occurs in the esophagus and can be caused by a number of factors, such as: 7 Accidentally swallowing food before it has been sufficiently chewed Underestimating the size of the food Pre-existing medical conditions that may narrow the esophagus, such as esophageal cancer and laryngeal cancer Once an edible object reaches the stomach, it will usually be broken down into smaller pieces through the body’s normal digestive processes. Therefore, edible obstructions most often affect the esophagus, whereas swallowing a non-edible item can affect any area of the digestive tract. Good to know: It is more typical for adults to experience obstructions due to food ingestion, whereas children are more likely to experience problems due to ingesting non-edible objects. 6\n\nNon-edible foreign bodies often seen ingested by children include: 2 3 6 Coins Small toy parts Pen lids Pins Screws Hair clips Button batteries In adults, non-edible foreign bodies are more commonly ingested by accident, and include: 3 Food-related items such as bones from meat, toothpicks and fruit pits Dentures",
    "risk_factors_for_foreign_body_ingestion": "Age is a primary risk factor for foreign body ingestion, with around 80 percent of reported incidents each year in the United States occurring in children. 8 Foreign body ingestion is also more prevalent in the elderly. Other risk factors include: 1 2 9 10 Mental health or psychiatric issues Learning difficulties Pre-existing digestive tract abnormalities, usually resulting from certain surgeries or existing medical conditions such as esophageal cancer Adolescent boys are more likely to ingest a foreign body than adolescent girls, although gender does not appear to be a risk factor in either young children or adults Intoxication. People under the influence of alcohol are more likely to accidentally swallow inadequately chewed food Good to know: Although there is no evidence to suggest that foreign body ingestion is more common in specific parts of the world, geographic location can affect which objects are most commonly swallowed. In the United States, coins are the foreign body most often ingested. In other countries, fish bones are more common. 9",
    "diagnosing_a_foreign_body_ingestion": "If the affected person is believed to have swallowed a foreign body, diagnosis is usually based on their personal account of the ingestion, the type of object swallowed, symptoms experienced and a physical examination. A physical examination may include the following procedures: 1 3 9 Visually checking the throat and pharynx, the passageway at the back of the throat that connects the mouth and esophagus Manually examining the neck to feel for any obstruction or abnormality Manually examining the abdomen to feel for any obstruction or abnormality Listening to the lungs and checking breathing function Checking vital signs such as blood pressure, temperature and heart rate People who are known to have swallowed a non-toxic, small, blunt object and are experiencing minimal or no symptoms, may not require any further tests and can simply be observed until the object passes in the stool and symptoms subside. 7 However, if the affected person is displaying significant symptoms or the object is likely to cause complications, further tests may be required.\n\nImaging tests, if necessary, usually begin with an X-ray of the neck, chest and abdominal regions. 11 This non-invasive test uses electromagnetic waves and can usually detect the presence and location of objects such as glass, meat bones, dentures, stone and certain metals including coins and batteries. These types of objects are referred to as radiopaque, meaning they are visible on radiograph tests such as X-rays. 3 Radiolucent objects, i.e. objects which do not always show up on an X-ray, include certain plastics, wood, fish bones and food. 12 Small or fine objects, made of any substance, may also avoid detection. If the foreign body is understood to be radiolucent, doctors might suggest a procedure called an esophagram. 13 This involves the affected person swallowing a small amount of dye called barium sulphate. The non-toxic powder coats the inside of the esophagus, allowing radiolucent objects to show-up during X-ray. Good to know: CT scans or MRI scans are less frequently used as an initial diagnostic tool for foreign body ingestion. However, they might be recommended as a further test to help confirm diagnosis or identify complications. 1 11\n\nAn endoscopy is a medical procedure where a long, thin tube ending in a light and camera is inserted into a person’s body in order to gain an internal view. The tube itself, known as an endoscope, is usually inserted through the mouth to access the throat and esophagus. 14 In the case of foreign body ingestion, an endoscopy can either be used: 9 Diagnostically, to confirm the presence and location of a foreign body, As a treatment method to physically remove the foreign body Diagnostic endoscopy is often suggested for people who have symptoms of a foreign body ingestion, but for whom imaging tests have been inconclusive. 7\n\nHand-held metal detectors are occasionally used and can be helpful in identifying the presence of commonly swallowed metal objects such as coins and batteries. 2 As this diagnostic method is quick and non-invasive, it is most often used in pediatric cases. However, although the use of a metal detector is fast, cheap and simple, it does not provide as much detailed information on the precise nature and location of the object as imaging tests do. Therefore, imaging tests are generally considered preferable when diagnosing a foreign body ingestion. 1 Good to know: Laboratory testing, such as blood tests or urine tests are rarely required during foreign body ingestion diagnosis. If they are suggested, it is usually to check for any associated complications, such as an infection. 11",
    "treatment": "Around 80 percent of foreign objects will pass through the gastrointestinal tract without causing any complications or requiring medical intervention. 1 However, foreign objects that have become stuck, that can damage the digestive tract or that have toxic properties, generally need to be removed. 2 Good to know: It is important to get specific advice from a doctor if a foreign body ingestion is suspected, even if the affected person is not currently displaying any symptoms.\n\nRemoval of the foreign body during an endoscopy is the most common treatment method for a foreign body ingestion. 15 An endoscope is a long, thin tube with a camera and light source on one end, which can be inserted into the human body to access and look into the digestive tract. As well as helping to locate the foreign body, certain surgical instruments such as forceps can be attached to the endoscope to enable removal of the object. Endoscopes are typically inserted through the mouth to access the esophagus and stomach, or through the anus to access the rectum and large intestine. An emergency endoscopy may be performed immediately if: 2 7 The foreign body is causing a significant obstruction of the airways The object is sharp enough to pierce internal walls The object is a battery or other item which could cause additional complications An endoscopy may also be recommended to remove the object under the following circumstances: 2 16 The object has been stuck in the esophagus for more than 24 hours The object has been stuck in the stomach for longer than three to four weeks The object is larger than 1 inch in diameter The object is awkwardly shaped and likely to become lodged The object is a magnet that can be successfully reached with the endoscope Good to know: Endoscopic removal of a foreign body very rarely results in complications, and is therefore typically considered a low-risk treatment method for foreign body ingestion. 17\n\nThe drug glucagon may be recommended for people who are suspected to have a piece of food stuck in their esophagus. This type of obstruction is often referred to as a food bolus impaction. 18 Glucagon is administered intravenously and relaxes the esophagus, allowing the food to naturally move down and enter the rest of the digestive tract. 2\n\nSurgery is typically only required in the most complicated of cases and less than 1 percent of foreign body ingestions result in surgical treatment. 1 Surgical removal of the foreign body may be necessary in the following instances: ref1 2 Endoscopic removal has been unsuccessful The object has been lodged in the small intestine for longer than a week Certain complications have occurred such as peritonitis, an inflammation of the tissue that lines the abdomen The object is filled with drugs and has become lodged, or the affected person is displaying symptoms of a drug overdose Good to know: Surgery is preferred over endoscopy to remove drug-filled packages from the body. This is due to the risk of an endoscope breaking open the package during retrieval and causing a serious overdose. 2\n\nAlthough the above treatments are widely used in cases of foreign body ingestion, there are a number of other possible treatment methods such as:\n\nThis method involves passing an un-inflated Foley catheter down the esophagus until it passes the foreign body. The catheter is then gently inflated and withdrawn, drawing the object away with it. This method should only be attempted by experienced medical staff and is only suitable for blunt esophageal obstructions that have been in place for less than 24 hours. 15\n\nThis method can be used with blunt foreign objects in the esophagus. It involves using a thin, cylindrical instrument known as a bougie to gently push on the object, dislodging it so it passes into the rest of the digestive tract. Again, this method should only be attempted by experienced medical staff and is only suitable for esophageal obstructions that have been in place for less than 24 hours. 15\n\nManual removal is rarely attempted in the upper digestive tract due to difficulties of access and the gag reflex. 20 However, if the object has passed all the way down to the rectum, manual removal via the anus might be possible. ref2\n\nFlushing techniques may be recommended for non-complicated foreign bodies lodged around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This involves the affected person eating and/or drinking in order to encourage the object to pass through the LES and into the stomach. Carbonated drinks are thought to be helpful in certain cases, as they can increase gas pressure in the esophagus. Good to know: Treatment options for foreign body ingestion are often different from person to person and dependent on individual circumstances. Always contact a doctor if a foreign body ingestion is suspected to confirm diagnosis and discuss appropriate treatment methods. You can also download the free Ada app and carry out a personalized symptom assessment.",
    "preventing_a_foreign_body_ingestion": "Educating caregivers about foreign body ingestion can help prevent the children in their care swallowing non-edible items. Preventive suggestions include: 21 22 Keeping small objects like coins, buttons and marbles away from children Being aware of battery-operated devices and supervising children’s play with them Home-safety procedures such as safety latches on cupboards and lockable drawers Taking special care around unusual times such as parties or vacations, when there may be extra visitors to the home and new objects within arms’ reach Foreign body ingestion can occur to anyone at any age. Avoid putting small objects which can accidentally be swallowed into your own mouth e.g. pen lids, screws, toothpicks. Always take care to eat slowly and chew food down into small, easily digestible chunks.",
    "complications": "A foreign body ingestion does not always result in medical complications. In 80 percent of cases, the object that has been swallowed will simply pass through the digestive tract as normal, exiting the body in the feces. 1 However, in some cases, the ingested object may cause complications. Around 1,500 deaths are reported each year in the United States due to foreign body ingestion. 1 Three primary causes of complications in foreign body ingestion are:\n\nThe term impaction is the state of something becoming lodged or stuck in a bodily passage. In foreign body ingestion the affected passage is usually the esophagus, but objects can also become stuck in the stomach, intestines or rectum. Impaction is most likely to occur with objects that are particularly large, sharp or unusually shaped. Impaction is the most common cause of complications in pediatric foreign body ingestions. 9 Typical symptoms of an object becoming stuck in the digestive tract have already been covered in the Symptoms section above. However, more severe complications of foreign body impaction include: 1 10 23 24 Difficulty breathing, particularly when the object is blocking the esophagus Deterioration of the soft tissues around the impacted object, known as necrosis Abscesses forming in the throat, esophagus or any soft tissue Narrowing of the esophagus, known as esophageal stricture, which can lead to choking or difficulty breathing\n\nThe term perforation refers to a hole made in a part of the body. This can occur in a foreign body ingestion when the swallowed object is sharp and pierces the internal walls of the digestive tract. Possible complications include: 1 2 23 25 Soft tissue infection, potentially leading to sepsis Mediastinitis, an inflammation in the chest cavity Peritonitis, an inflammation in the abdominal cavity Pneumothorax, a collapsed lung Internal bleeding\n\nComplications may also occur when the swallowed foreign body contains toxic chemicals or substances that can be dangerous when consumed. Generally, such complications are associated with objects such as batteries, coins or drugs. Possible complications include: 1 6 7 23 27 Deterioration of the soft tissues around the object, known as necrosis Internal burns Formation of a fistula, which is an abnormal connection between two hollow spaces in the body. In foreign body ingestion, a tracheoesophageal fistula is most likely, in which the trachea and esophagus tubes, which are not usually joined, become connected Metal poisoning Allergic reaction to the ingested object, such as a nickel allergy Good to know: Severe complications due to a foreign body ingestion are rare, but can occur. Although impaction, perforation and toxic substances are known causes of medical complications, the precise symptoms displayed can be extremely variable. Always contact a doctor immediately if a foreign body ingestion is suspected.",
    "foreign_body_ingestion_faqs": "Q: Can a foreign body ingestion be caused by food? A: Yes. Medical issues arising from a foreign body ingestion can be caused by swallowing both non-edible and edible objects. Whereas children are more likely to swallow non-food objects, adults are more likely to experience health problems due to food ingestion. Q: What foreign objects are most commonly swallowed? A: In the United States, the object most commonly swallowed is a coin. In other countries, fish bones are the most frequently swallowed foreign body. Other foreign bodies often swallowed include: Small toy parts Pen lids Pins and screws Hair clips Button batteries Needles Magnets Buttons Food-related items such as bones from meat, toothpicks and fruit pits – most often seen in adults Dentures – most often seen in adults Q: Should I contact a doctor if I or a loved one has swallowed a foreign object? A: Yes. Even though the majority of foreign body ingestions do not result in complications and sometimes do not even cause symptoms, it is still important to visit a doctor for a proper examination. In some cases, foreign body ingestion can result in serious complications and may even become life-threatening, so always seek medical help if it is suspected. Q: What is the treatment for a foreign body ingestions? A: Treatment for a foreign body ingestion depends on the object that has been swallowed, as well as where in the digestive tract it is. In many cases, a non-complicated foreign body will simply pass through the gastrointestinal tract without the need for any medical treatment at all. However, if treatment is required, an endoscopy is the most common method. This procedure involves passing a long, thin tube into the digestive tract in order to locate and remove the foreign object. Other, less common, treatment methods include medication and surgery. Q: Why is foreign body ingestion more common in children than adults? A: Foreign body ingestions are much more common in childhood than in adulthood. This is because young children often use their mouths to explore new objects, leading to a greater chance of accidentally swallowing a foreign body. Children are also less aware of the associated risks, and are therefore more likely to ingest potentially harmful objects such as batteries, magnets or sharp items.",

    "what_is_gallbladder_cancer": "Gallbladder cancer, also known as a malignant neoplasm of the gallbladder, is a rare cancer with just over 12,000 new cases expected to be confirmed in the U.S. in 2018. 1 The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ which sits under the liver on the right side of the body. It stores bile, a digestive fluid produced by the liver, and releases it during eating. Bile helps break down fatty foods. Treatment of gallbladder cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has already spread at the time of diagnosis. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. A person does not need a gallbladder to live a normal life. There are normally no early symptoms of gallbladder cancer, or they may go unnoticed, since many symptoms, such as burping or stomach pain, are non-specific. As a result, the condition is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Later symptoms include a lump in the upper right part of the abdomen and yellowing of the skin. This condition most commonly affects people older than 65. Women are affected over two times more often than men. Gallstones and persistent inflammation of the gallbladder, known as cholecystitis , are known to increase the risk of gallbladder cancer, though most people with these conditions never develop gallbladder cancer. 2",
    "types": "There are different types of gallbladder cancer, with different treatments and outcomes, depending on which cells the cancer develops in. For example:\n\nAbout 85 percent of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas developing from the gland cells in the lining of the gallbladder, which normally produce mucus. There are two main types of gallbladder adenocarcinoma: 3 4 Non-papillary adenocarcinoma: This is by far the most common type of gallbladder cancer. Papillary adenocarcinoma: About 6 percent of gallbladder cancers are papillary adenocarcinomas. This type of gallbladder cancer tends to have a better outlook than most other types of gallbladder cancer, as it is less likely to spread to the liver or lymph nodes. Other types of gallbladder cancer are extremely rare. These include: 3 4\n\nThis develops from the skin-like cells that line the gallbladder. Squamous cell cancers are treated similarly to adenocarcinomas, with removal of the gallbladder as the best treatment, if still possible at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThese have both squamous cancer cells and glandular cancer cells. Adenosquamous cancers are treated similarly to adenocarcinomas, with removal of the gallbladder as the best treatment if still possible at the time of diagnosis.",
    "symptoms": "Gallbladder cancer does not normally have early symptoms. Signs of gallbladder cancer tend to appear when the tumor is fairly large and may have spread. If symptoms do appear sooner, earlier diagnosis can lead to prompt treatment and a better prognosis. The most common gallbladder cancer symptoms include: 5 6 Stomach pain: Commonly in the upper right part of the abdomen, often described as a dragging feeling, though it can also be a sharper pain if the tumor blocks the bile duct. Most people with gallbladder cancer will develop stomach pain. Nausea and/or vomiting: This symptom is common in the later stages of gallbladder cancer. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, known as jaundice: This occurs if the tumor grows big enough to block the bile ducts, which normally drain bile from the liver into the intestines. This can lead to a yellowish chemical found in bile, called bilirubin , building up in the blood and settling in different areas of the body. Lumps on the right side of the stomach: The gallbladder may swell if the tumor blocks the bile ducts. Gallbladder cancer may also spread to nearby parts of the liver, which may also present as lumps. Less common signs of gallbladder cancer may include: 5 6 Loss of appetite and/or weight Indigestion, such as bloating and burping Swollen stomach Fever Itchiness Dark urine Greasy or light-colored feces Good to know: These symptoms are much more likely to be caused by other conditions, as gallbladder cancer is rare. For instance, hepatitis is a common cause of jaundice. However, if any of these symptoms are present, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible to treat the underlying cause.

    "causes_and_risk_factors": "It is not known what causes most gallbladder cancers. However, there are factors that can increase the risk of developing it. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer may include: 7 8 History of gallbladder disease: Conditions such as gallstones – also known as cholelithiasis , cholecystitis , gallbladder polyps, porcelain gallbladder, and bile duct abnormalities increase risk for gallbladder cancer. Being female: Women are twice as likely as men to get gallbladder cancer in the U.S. Being over the age of about 65 Family history of gallbladder cancer may increase the chance of getting gallbladder cancer, though it is not normally associated Being obese: This may be related to the increased risk for developing gallstones Chronic typhoid: An infection that can cause irritation of the gallbladder wall, but that is very rare in the U.S. Ethnicity and geography: Incidence of gallbladder cancer varies widely between racial groups and people living in different parts of the world, likely due to genetic and socioeconomic factors. Rates of gallbladder cancer are highest in areas including Latin America, Asia, and Eastern and Central Europe Being of particular ethnic groups: In the U.S., Native American Indians and Hispanics of Mexican descent have the highest risk, while African-Americans have a lower risk Good to know: Gallbladder cancer is rare, and the risk normally remains low, even if a person has known risk factors. Having one or more risk factors doesn’t mean that any one person  will get gallbladder cancer. Equally, a person can have no known risk factors and still develop it.",
    "gallbladder_cancer_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms in patients being treated for anal cancer. This is because cancer therapy weakens the immune system, which puts you at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Taking the necessary precautions and getting tested as soon as possible if you start experiencing symptoms is essential. Talk to your doctor to determine whether you're eligible for antiviral medication .",
    "diagnosis": "Gallbladder cancer can be difficult to detect and diagnose for several reasons: There are normally no noticeable signs or symptoms in its early stages The typical symptoms are similar to the symptoms of many other conditions For this reason, gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed to treat another condition. Otherwise, as the first step, a doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. In addition, a doctor may perform the following diagnostic tests: 9 10\n\nBlood tests may be done to test for: 9 10 Liver and gallbladder function: Bilirubin, albumin, liver enzymes and certain other substance blood levels can help diagnose liver, bile duct or gallbladder disease. Tumor markers: People with gallbladder cancer may have high blood levels of markers called CEA and CA 19-9, usually only in the advanced stages. It should be noted that other health conditions can also raise these markers. These markers can be followed during treatment to see how well it is working.\n\nThere are many possible imaging tests that may be used to test for gallbladder cancer: 9 10 Ultrasound: A probe on the skin over the right upper abdomen or an endoscope – a thin tube with a light and camera on the end – passed through the mouth and down into the first part of the small intestine produces an image of the internal area using soundwaves. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): An ERCP uses an endoscope to examine and X-ray the gallbladder and other connected organs. After the endoscope is passed through the mouth and into the first part of the small intestine, a smaller tube known as a catheter is inserted through the endoscope into the bile and pancreatic ducts. A dye is then injected through the catheter into the ducts, and an X-ray is taken. Sometimes, a similar procedure may be performed by injecting contrast materials through keyhole surgery . Computed tomography (CT) scan: A CT scan uses X-rays to make detailed cross-section images of the gallbladder. Often, contrast material is injected through a drip to the vein. Sometimes a person may also be asked to swallow contrast material, such as barium, which coats the digestive tract, before being X-rayed.  Additionally, a CT angiogram may be performed. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP): This is a specialized type of MRI scan that produces detailed images of the bile duct and other connected organs. An MRI uses a magnetic field rather than X-rays to take detailed pictures of internal body structures. It involves lying on a bed inside an MRI scanner for between 20 minutes and an hour. Often, in the case of an MRCP, a contrast material has to be injected into a vein to make details of structures inside the gallbladder easier to see. These imaging methods may be used to create a picture of the structures inside the body. These may help: To look for areas that may contain cancer To help a doctor guide a biopsy needle to take a tissue sample from a suspicious area To see how far cancer has spread To help check if the treatment is working To see if there are signs that the cancer has returned after treatment\n\nA biopsy is often the only way to be certain of a gallbladder cancer diagnosis. This involves removal of a small amount of tissue or sometimes fluid from an area. Cells are then examined under a microscope and further tested to check for the presence of cancer.",
    "treatment": "The treatment of gallbladder cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread. The combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. The three main treatments used are: 11 Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Alternative treatments are also being developed in clinical trials.\n\nIf the gallbladder cancer is found early enough and has not yet spread, then the gallbladder and surrounding tissues will be removed in a surgery known as cholecystectomy. This is known as a resectable gallbladder cancer, and may be cured. 12 However, most gallbladder cancers are found when they have spread too far to be removed by surgery, when they are known as unresectable. Doctors may then focus on treatments to relieve symptoms and help an affected person to live longer. Certain types of surgery are sometimes used to relieve symptoms caused by the tumor blocking the bile duct and bile building up in the gallbladder: 11 13\n\nThis involves a doctor cutting the gallbladder or bile duct in an area before the blockage and sewing it to the small intestine to create a pathway around the blocked area.\n\nA thin tube called a stent is fed in from the mouth and through the digestive system to drain bile that has built up in the area, either into the small intestine or into a bag  outside of the body.\n\nIf endoscopic stent surgery is not possible, then the stent is placed by cutting the skin. This procedure may be done to relieve jaundice before other surgical procedures are carried out\n\nAlso known as radiation therapy, radiotherapy uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapy is the use of medication to destroy cancer cells. Most of the chemotherapy medications for gallbladder cancer are administered into the bloodstream, though some may be given in tablet form. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be used to treat gallbladder cancer, but, used alone, they are unlikely to cure this type of cancer. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are not usually used to treat early gallbladder cancer but may be used in cases of advanced gallbladder cancer, 14 often in combination with each other. Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy may be used to treat gallbladder cancer in the following cases: 15 16 Palliative care: Chemo and radiotherapy may be used to help relieve symptoms of the cancer, for instance pain caused by the tumor pressing on nerves, as it can help shrink tumors or slow their growth. However, these treatments, in particular chemotherapy , cause side effects, and may themselves require palliative care. After surgery to remove tumors: Chemotherapy is given after surgery, sometimes with radiation therapy, to try to reduce the chances of the cancer returning. As part of treatment for advanced gallbladder cancer: Chemotherapy may be used for more advanced cancers that cannot be surgically removed or which have spread, not to cure them, but to help people live longer. Good to know: These treatments, in particular chemotherapy, can sometimes have unpleasant side effects. For example, chemotherapy may cause hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. Radiotherapy may cause, for example, skin irritation and nausea. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage side effects, should they occur (see chemotherapy side effects ).",
    "gallbladder_cancer_staging": "Once gallbladder cancer is diagnosed, doctors will try to find out whether it has spread and if so, how far, in a process known as staging. Gallbladder cancers usually undergo pathologic staging, which is determined during surgery to remove the cancerous tissue.. 17 The cancer maybe given a number stage from 1 to 4. The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. 0 is the earliest stage gallbladder cancer, also known as carcinoma in situ. Gallbladder cancer is considered to be stage 3 or stage 4 gallbladder cancer once the tumor has grown through all of the outer layers of the gallbladder. The staging system most often used to determine the stage for gallbladder cancer is the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system.\n\nAdenocarcinomas and papillary carcinomas may have a better prognosis than rarer cancers, such as squamous and adenosquamous carcinomas.\n\nGallbladder cancers, which are seen under the microscope in small blood vessels or lymph vessels, tend to have a poor prognosis, as there’s a greater chance they have spread outside of the gallbladder.\n\nResectable cancers – those that are thought to be completely removable by surgery – have a better outlook. Most gallbladder cancers are unresectable by the time they’re found, as they have already spread too far or are in too difficult a place to be entirely removed by surgery.",
    "other_names_for_gallbladder_cancer": "Malignant neoplasm of gallbladder",
    "faq": "Q: Is gallbladder cancer rare? A: Yes, gallbladder cancer is quite rare. There are various risk factors which may put a person at increased risk of developing gallbladder cancer. For instance, incidence rates of gallbladder cancer are higher in women than in men. 18 However, the risk remains low across populations: In the U.S., there are about 1.4 cases of gallbladder cancer per 100,000 women and 0.8 cases per 100,000 men. 19 Q: Is gallbladder cancer curable? A: Gallbladder cancer is more likely to be curable if it is caught in the earliest stages, when it may be completely removed by removing the gallbladder and sometimes surrounding tissues, such as part of the liver and the surrounding lymph nodes, to lower the risk of the cancer coming back. Sadly, because gallbladder cancer does not normally have symptoms in these early stages, it is often diagnosed in the later stages when treatment is unlikely to result in cure. Q: Is there immunotherapy for gallbladder cancer? A: Current clinical trials are testing immunotherapy, also known as biologic therapy, as a way to treat gallbladder cancer. This is a type of cancer treatment that boosts the body’s natural defences to fight cancer, using substances made by the body or in a laboratory to improve or restore immune system function."

    "what_is_gastroenteritis": "Gastroenteritis, sometimes called gastro, gastric flu or stomach flu, is a common condition caused by irritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestines. 1 It is usually the result of a viral or bacterial infection, but can also be caused by: Parasites Chemicals Certain medications. The main symptoms of both viral and bacterial gastroenteritis are: Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Abdominal cramping Although they can be very unpleasant, most cases of gastroenteritis clear on their own within a few days, without specific treatment. The main complication tends to be dehydration, particularly among young children and the elderly. To prevent dehydration, it is important to replace fluids that are lost through vomiting and diarrhea.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of gastroenteritis (viral and bacterial) can range from mild to severe, but typically include: Diarrhea, which is often watery Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain and cramps Loss of appetite These symptoms often appear suddenly. In addition, someone with gastroenteritis may present with the following: 2 Bloating Fever Chills Headache Body aches Lethargy If there are symptoms of a more serious illness, or if the gastroenteritis does not resolve within a few days, it is important to seek medical advice. Things to watch out for are: Indications of severe dehydration (such as passing little to no urine, and dizziness that does not go away) Blood or pus in the diarrhea Constant vomiting that makes it impossible to keep down liquids A fever over 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) In addition, if the affected person has recently returned from overseas travel, or has a serious underlying health condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, it is advisable to see a doctor.",
    "causes": "Viruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis, particularly in children. However, the following can also cause the condition: Bacteria and their byproducts Parasites Toxic chemicals Certain drugs\n\nA number of different viruses cause gastroenteritis . Although the condition is sometimes referred to as stomach flu, the influenza virus is not to blame. Flu shares some of the same symptoms, headache, fever, and body aches, but it does not usually affect the stomach and intestines. 1 The main types of viruses that cause gastroenteritis are: 4 Norovirus Rotavirus Adenovirus Astrovirus. Of these, norovirus and rotavirus are the most common, with rotavirus responsible for the majority of cases of viral gastroenteritis in children. Viral gastroenteritis is highly contagious, leading to outbreaks in schools, hospitals, prisons and other places where large numbers of people are in close proximity. The virus is present in the stool and vomit of those who are infected, and is spread easily from person to person, particularly when people forget to wash their hands after using the toilet. Infection typically occurs by sharing the following with someone who has the virus: Food Drink Eating utensils Towels It can also spread by a person touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching your mouth, or consuming food or water contaminated with the virus. It has been suggested that swallowing airborne viral particles after someone has vomited may also be a possible route of transmission for some viruses. Raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters, can also be a source of the virus, as they may be contaminated from dirty water. However, this is relatively rare. 5 Read more about Viral Gastroenteritis »\n\nA range of different bacteria can also cause bacterial gastroenteritis . These include: 6 Salmonella Campylobacter Shigella Escherichia coli Clostridium difficile Some of these bacteria can be transmitted from person to person, but they are most often spread through contaminated food and water. Bacterial gastroenteritis can be acquired from: Undercooked meat, eggs and fish Unpasteurised milk and juices Untreated water Food that is improperly stored or prepared Raw fruits and vegetables that are not thoroughly washed in clean water. Contact with reptiles, birds and amphibians Bacterial gastroenteritis is a common cause of “traveler’s diarrhea”, a type of gastroenteritis that frequently affects travelers to developing countries. It is often the result of poor food hygiene in local restaurants. 7 Some cases of gastroenteritis are not caused by the bacteria themselves, but by toxins that they release. The harmful byproducts of certain types of bacteria can contaminate food, causing food poisoning when ingested. These byproducts are called exotoxins, and usually cause symptoms within 12 hours of consumption. This type of gastroenteritis typically resolves within 36 hours. 6 Read more about Bacterial Gastroenteritis »\n\nGastroenteritis can also be caused by infection with intestinal parasites. The two most commonly implicated are giardia and cryptosporidium. 6 These parasites are found all over the world and are typically acquired through contaminated water or contact with infected animals. Giardia can also be spread from person to person, for example in daycare centers, if people do not wash their hands after using the toilet. Infection with giardia is known as giardiasis, and can become chronic if not treated properly, causing malabsorption of nutrients. Cryptosporidium infections, which are usually acquired through swimming in and accidentally swallowing contaminated water, typically resolve on their own within two weeks. The amoeba E. histolytica is another type of parasite that can cause gastroenteritis. It is not common in developed countries, but should be ruled out as a cause of the condition if the affected person has recently traveled to countries in Africa, Asia and Central and South America. 8\n\nWhile uncommon, in susceptible people gastroenteritis can be an adverse effect of certain medications. These include: Antacids Antibiotics Laxatives Anthelmintics Some drugs used in cancer treatment Radiation therapy can also cause symptoms similar to those of gastroenteritis. In addition, gastroenteritis can be triggered by the ingestion of heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic. It can also be caused by plant toxins, in the case of ingesting poisonous plants and mushrooms. 9 If any of these causes are suspected, medical advice should be sought without delay.",
    "diagnosis": "Many cases of gastroenteritis go away on their own, without treatment, and without the need for a formal diagnosis by a doctor. It is important to see a medical practitioner to identify the cause of the illness if the condition does not clear within a few days, or if there are any causes for concern, such as: Blood or pus in the stool Constant vomiting or diarrhea A high fever Symptoms of dehydration (for example, dry mouth, headache, and infrequently passing small amounts of urine) This is also the case if the affected person has recently traveled, has a weakened immune system or underlying health condition. The treatment prescribed will differ depending on what is causing the gastroenteritis. Medical practitioners typically start by taking a medical history and performing a physical examination. They may then order blood and stool tests if they deem it necessary. 2",
    "treatment": "In most cases of viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, basic supportive treatment is sufficient. This includes magaining the nausea, vomiting and diarrhea through: 6 Bed rest Oral rehydration Medication As long as there are no indications of a more serious condition or severe dehydration, gastroenteritis can generally be treated at home. It is very important that a person with gastroenteritis drink plenty of fluids. They should take frequent small sips in between vomiting or bowel movements. To help prevent or treat mild dehydration, oral rehydration drinks, available from pharmacies, can be used. These are different to sports drinks and carbonated beverages, which are not as effective in replacing lost electrolytes. If a person with gastroenteritis is unable to keep any liquids down, or is becoming severely dehydrated, they can be admitted to hospital to receive intravenous fluids via a drip. To avoid spreading the infection to others, a person with gastroenteritis should stay home until their symptoms have completely cleared. 4 They should also take care to wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet, and before preparing or eating food.\n\nIf the nausea and vomiting is severe, an antiemetic medicine such as ondansetron may be helpful. 6 Antiemetics lessen the feelings of nausea and prevent vomiting, which can help the person with gastroenteritis to rehydrate and rest. However, these medicines should not be used if a more serious condition is suspected. Anti-diarrheal medication such as loperamide can also be taken, but should be avoided in certain cases. 6 These include: Where the person has recently taken antibiotics Where there is blood or pus in the stool Where a more serious condition is suspected. In these cases, it is advisable to consult a doctor first. Antibiotics are not widely prescribed for gastroenteritis, as they are only effective in certain cases of bacterial gastroenteritis . They may be prescribed for traveler’s diarrhea, or infections with shigella or campylobacter. 6 Doctors will often test for the specific bacteria before prescribing antibiotics. If a painkiller is needed, paracetamol is preferred over ibuprofen and other medication that can cause further irritation to the digestive tract. Where the cause of the gastroenteritis is a parasite, an anti-parasitic medication will be prescribed.\n\nThere are a number of home remedies that can help with the treatment of gastroenteritis. These include: 10 Drinking lots of fluids, such water, clear broths, and caffeine-free sports drinks, as well as oral rehydration mixes, to replace electrolytes lost through diarrhea and vomiting Sucking on ice chips when nothing else will stay down Resting as much as possible Letting the stomach settle, then reintroducing food slowly, beginning with bland, simple foods like rice, crackers, bananas and clear chicken soup Avoiding dairy, as well as rich and fatty foods, until recovery is complete Avoiding caffeine, alcohol and nicotine until recovery is complete Probiotics may slightly shorten the duration of diarrhea, 6 so they can be considered as a complementary remedy in the treatment of gastroenteritis.",
    "prevention": "Practicing good hygiene is the best way to prevent the spread of gastroenteritis. These precautions should be taken: 2 5 6 Wash your hands thoroughly after using the toilet, after contact with animals, before preparing or eating food, and after changing a diaper. Use soap and water, or hand sanitizer if water is not available. Teach children to do the same. Make sure that food is stored properly and prepared hygienically Keep the kitchen and bathroom clean. Disinfect surfaces regularly, using bleach diluted in water (dilute according to the instructions on the product). When someone has gastroenteritis, clean and disinfect the toilet after each bout of vomiting or diarrhea. Do not share towels, washcloths or utensils with someone who is ill. Wash these separately, using hot water. Stay off work or school until 48 hours after the symptoms have cleared. When traveling, take care to avoid tap water (including ice cubes) and potentially contaminated food if the area seems to lack adequate sanitation. If you have diarrhea, avoid swimming. Vaccinate children against rotavirus.",
    "gastroenteritis_in_children": "Young children are particularly susceptible to rotavirus infections, because they often forget to wash their hands after using the toilet and before eating food. They have also not yet built up a resistance to rotavirus. It is estimated that all children will have at least one bout of viral gastroenteritis before they are five years old, and many will have multiple episodes a year. 11 In most cases, gastroenteritis does not need to be formally diagnosed by a doctor, and the illness clears on its own within five to seven days. However, as with adults, if there are any indications of a more serious condition, medical advice should be sought. These include: Symptoms of dehydration Vomiting for more than three days Diarrhea for more than a week Blood, mucus or pus in the stools A high temperature (over 38 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit) Shortness of breath or rapid breathing Confusion Stiff neck Rash Green vomit Severe stomach pain Swelling of the abdomen A bulging fontanelle (in infants) In addition, if the child has a weakened immune system or underlying illness, or has recently traveled, it is important to see a doctor. Young children, particularly those under a year old, are at high risk of dehydration. Caregivers need to monitor for the following symptoms, 11 and seek medical advice if they are present: Dry eyes and mouth No tears when crying Sunken eyes Irritability and drowsiness Reduced urine Cold hands and feet Pale or blotchy skin Rapid breathing A sunken fontanelle in infants As long as there is no indication of dehydration or another serious condition, children can generally be treated at home. Treatment for gastroenteritis should be supportive, with an emphasis on rest and rehydration. The child should be encouraged to drink lots of fluids. Avoid carbonated drinks and juices, as they may worsen the diarrhea. Water and oral rehydration mixes are recommended. As soon as the vomiting is under control, the child should be encouraged to eat simple solid foods such as bread, rice and plain pasta. Infants should be fed breast milk or their other milk feeds as usual. Antiemetics, anti-diarrheals and other medication should be given to children only on the recommendation of a medical practitioner. Paracetamol can be used to reduce a temperature and alleviate aches and pains. Read more about Pediatric Viral Gastroenteritis »",

    "faqs": "Q: Is gastroenteritis contagious? A: Yes. Most cases of gastroenteritis are highly contagious, and can be spread easily from person to person. The exception is gastroenteritis caused by drugs, chemicals or poisonous substances. To prevent the transmission of bacterial, viral or parasite-related gastroenteritis, it is important to practice good hygiene. A person may be contagious for anything from several days up to two weeks after recovery from viral gastroenteritis. 12 Q: How long does gastroenteritis last? A: Most cases of gastroenteritis clear within a few days to a week. In children, it may take five to seven days. If the symptoms persist, it is important to consult a medical practitioner. Q: When should I see a doctor about gastroenteritis? A: It is advisable to consult a medical practitioner if: You are vomiting a lot and cannot keep fluids down You suspect that you are becoming dehydrated You notice any blood in your vomit or stools You have severe stomach pain You have a high temperature that does not go down You have persistent diarrhea In addition, if you are elderly, pregnant, have a chronic health condition like diabetes, or have a compromised immune system, it is also important to consult a doctor. 13 Q: Should I be worried about gastroenteritis during pregnancy? A: Pregnant women are just as susceptible to gastroenteritis as everyone else. Most cases of the illness will clear on their own without any complications, and can be treated with rest and rehydration. Medicines should be used with caution. A medical practitioner should be consulted before taking any antiemetics or other medication. 14 If the gastroenteritis does not clear, there is a fever, or there are indications of a more serious condition, medical advice should be sought without delay. Q: Is there a vaccine against rotavirus or norovirus? A: There exists a vaccine against rotavirus, the main virus that causes acute gastroenteritis, named Rotarix. It is recommended that children and other at risk groups be vaccinated against rotavirus as early as possible. 15 Although there are vaccines in development, there currently exists no widely available vaccine against norovirus, another of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis. 16 Consult a doctor for further information regarding vaccines and other preventive measures against rotavirus and norovirus. Q: Should I be worried about “traveler’s diarrhea”? A: Traveler’s diarrhea – a type of diarrhea that develops during or shortly after travel abroad – is commonly caused by bacterial gastroenteritis. The main symptom is diarrhea (typically watery), though nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains may also occur. Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are relatively mild and can be managed without the need for medical advice. Dehydration is the main risk, meaning it is important to consume plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. 17 Medical advice should be sought in any of the following situations: A fever is present There is blood in the stool There is difficulty replacing fluids because of frequent bouts of diarrhea or vomiting Symptoms last for more than three or four days Antibiotic medication has been taken but symptoms have not ceased within three days of treatment The affected individual is elderly or has an underlying medical condition The affected individual is pregnant The affected individual is under six months of age Medical attention should also be sought when dehydration is suspected. Dehydration may present the following symptoms in adults: Tiredness Dizziness Headache Muscle cramps Urinating less Dry mouth Weakness Irritability The symptoms of dehydration in children include: Loss of energy Weakness Confusion Increased heart rate Urinating less Q: Do I have gastroenteritis (stomach flu) or the flu ? A: Gastroenteritis and the flu are easily confused, especially as gastroenteritis is also termed the stomach flu. They are, however, distinct conditions with their own symptoms. For example, diarrhea and vomiting (the main symptoms of gastroenteritis) are only very rarely associated with the flu. Moreover, the coughing and congestion associated with the flu are not symptoms of gastroenteritis. If there is any doubt over which condition an individual is experiencing, a doctor’s opinion should be sought. 18 Q: What is the difference between gastroenteritis, gastritis and enteritis? A: Gastroenteritis, gastritis and enteritis are distinct but similar conditions of the gastrointestinal system. The key distinction between the three is the specific part of the gastrointestinal tract that they affect. Gastroenteritis affects the stomach and small intestine, gastritis affects only the stomach, while enteritis affects only the small intestine. 19 20"

    "what_is_gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease , commonly known as GERD or GORD, is a condition in which stomach acid leaks backwards up the esophagus, the tube between the mouth and stomach. It is a common condition, especially in people over the age of 40 and pregnant women. People who smoke and/or regularly drink alcohol, and those who are obese are also more likely to develop GERD.\n\nCommon symptoms include a burning pain in the chest (heartburn) and an acidic taste in the mouth. The symptoms of GERD can be managed through diet and lifestyle changes, for example, losing weight, quitting smoking and/or reducing alcohol intake, and by taking medications to reduce stomach acidity. Gastroesophageal reflux disease can generally be effectively and well managed and usually causes no long-term problems.\n\nIt is important to recognize the difference between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and gastroesophageal reflux, also known as acid reflux. Acid reflux is the backward flow of stomach acid up into the throat. This may cause a burning sensation in the chest, and this symptom is commonly referred to as heartburn. Acid reflux, and associated heartburn, is a fairly common, and if it only occurs occasionally it is often non-serious. However when it occurs frequently, or in combination with other symptoms, it may be an indicator that the affected person is experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nEsophagitis is the name given to inflammation of the esophagus. The condition can lead to symptoms including problems swallowing, pain in the chest and, in more severe cases, bleeding may occur. This may involve the presence of blood in the vomit or in the stool. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common cause of esophagitis, along with certain eating disorders, such as bulimia, certain medications and some infections. 1",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_symptoms": "Heartburn is the most common symptom of GERD. It is usually experienced as a burning or sharp sensation in the center of the chest which may spread to the throat. Typically, heartburn follows a meal, though it may also be triggered by lying down or bending over. In some cases, heartburn may occur at night, especially when lying flat without the head raised on a pillow. Other signs and symptoms of GERD include: 2 3 Stomach pain Pain when swallowing and an acidic taste in the mouth. Bloating Getting full quickly Bad breath Non-burning chest pain A hoarse voice Nausea and/or vomiting Regurgitation of food Coughing and wheezing A persistent sore throat A feeling of a lump in the throat that is present despite swallowing Enamel erosion The symptoms experienced and the severity of these symptoms may differ from person to person. Some of these symptoms may also indicate a more severe condition. For this reason, it is always advisable to seek a professional medical opinion when symptoms occur. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to get an idea of what may be the cause of the symptoms.",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_causes": "The esophageal sphincter, a circular band of muscle at the base of the esophagus, usually prevents acid from leaking. Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs when the sphincter becomes weakened and does not function as well as it should . There are various reasons why this can happen, but, in some cases, the exact cause cannot be identified. 4 Most people will experience acid reflux at some point in their lives, but some people are more at risk of developing GERD than others. These people include: 3 5 People over the age of 40 Pregnant women Overweight or obese people People who smoke tobacco and drink alcohol and/or caffeinated beverages regularly People who are under high levels of stress People with hiatus hernia, a condition involving part of the stomach pushing through the diaphragm People with certain other gastrointestinal conditions, like some malformations People with scleroderma, a rare condition that can cause the skin and internal organs to become thicker and hardened",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_diagnosis": "Tests are often not necessary to confirm a diagnosis of GERD. A doctor will usually be able to identify the condition from a description of the symptoms being experienced. Tests, however, may be necessary if the symptoms are severe and/or other more serious conditions are suspected. These tests may include: 2 4 A gastroscopy (endoscopy): Using a flexible telescopic tube, doctors are able to see inside the esophagus and stomach and identify any signs of inflammation or injury. This will typically be the first diagnostic test performed. Esophageal manometry: A tube is swallowed that is able to measure the muscle contractions of the esophagus and detect whether the sphincter is functioning as it should. Typically only performed if a gastroscopy is unrevealing. Acidity test: A test to check the acid levels in the esophagus may be ordered if a gastroscopy is unrevealing. Other tests: Alternative diagnostic tests, such as a chest X-ray or an electrocardiogram may also be ordered if the diagnosis is not certain or other conditions need to be ruled out.",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd_complications": "The majority of people who experience GERD do not develop any complications , particularly if the condition is managed well. However, complications are possible. One of the most common complications of GERD is esophagitis, a condition involving inflammation of the esophagus. If esophagitis occurs, symptoms may include: Problems swallowing Pain in the chest In severe cases, bleeding, which may cause signs of blood in the stool and/or vomit GERD is one of the most common causes of esophagitis, along with certain eating disorders, e.g. bulimia, as well as certain medications and some infections. 1 Other, less common complications of GERD include: 2 6 7 8 Ulcers: Stomach acid moving up into the esophagus can cause esophageal ulcers. These ulcers may bleed. If this happens, the blood may not be noticed, unless it is detected in the vomit and/or stool. Stricture: If the esophagus becomes damaged, it can scar and narrow, potentially causing a blockage, or stricture. Strictures can vary in severity, but can potentially prevent food and medication from reaching the stomach. If a stricture occurs, professional medical treatment, which may include surgery, is required. If a stricture causes severe difficulty swallowing, this requires urgent medical attention and could progress to become a medical emergency. Barrett’s esophagus: A condition that occurs when the normal cells of the esophagus, the squamous cells, are replaced by intestinal cells, usually as a result of damage to the lining of the esophagus. Barrett’s esophagus is a risk factor for esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer: Cancer as a complication of GERD is very rare. Difficulty swallowing and unintended weight loss are two of the most typical early symptoms. For more information, take a look at this comprehensive resource on esophageal cancer . People worried that they may be experiencing symptoms of GERD or a complication of GERD should talk to a doctor. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd_treatments": "The treatment method used for gastroesophageal reflux disease will depend on the severity of the condition. Mild cases will usually be treated with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medication. Lifestyle changes include: 2 9 10 Losing weight through maintaining a healthy diet and undertaking regular exercise Avoiding reflux-inducing foods and drinks, such as caffeinated beverages, chocolate and alcohol Quitting smoking Avoiding late, very fatty and very large meals Reducing stress levels by learning and applying effective stress and health-management techniques If medication is required, doctors will generally prescribe proton pump inhibitors . This type of medication is generally safe to use and causes few side-effects. If the condition responds well to the medication,  the affected person may only need to use them in the short-term, usually for around eight weeks. However, if symptoms return, long-term use may be required. Antacids, such as H2-antagonists, may also be prescribed in some cases.",
    "gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_gerd_prevention": "Losing weight through the maintenance of a healthy and balanced diet, moving around regularly, drinking less coffee, avoiding alcohol, quitting smoking and learning better ways to deal better with daily stress can help to prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease. Treating the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux  can also help to prevent long-term complications of the condition.",
    "other_names_for_gastroesophageal_reflux_disease": "Acid reflux disease GERD GORD\n\nQ: Are GERD and heartburn the same thing? A: No, but heartburn is the most typical symptom of GERD. While heartburn can be experienced without GERD, people experiencing heartburn alongside other symptoms of GERD, such as chest pain, stomach pain and an acidic taste in the mouth, should see a doctor for an evaluation. Q: What is refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (refractory GERD)? A: Most people with GERD, who are treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), will find the medication effective in managing symptoms. However, in a smaller number of cases, PPIs will prove ineffective or only partially effective. 11 This is a state known as refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease or refractory GERD. People with refractory GERD will be evaluated for alternative treatment methods by doctors. 12 Q: Can I develop gastroesophageal reflux disease without esophagitis? A: Yes, although GERD is a common cause of esophagitis, it is possible to develop GERD without also developing esophagitis. There is debate over whether this should be considered a sub-entity of GERD or a condition of its own called non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). GERD without esophagitis seems to be particularly common in people with refractory GERD. Research suggests that the reflux in refractory GERD is often less acidic than in non-treated GERD, possibly explaining why the inflammation associated with esophagitis does not occur. 13 11 Q: Is there a natural cure for GERD? A: While it may not be appropriate to speak of a natural “cure” for GERD, there are several natural, or non-medicinal, ways of effectively managing the condition. The most commonly recommended of these include: Losing weight by following a healthy, varied and balanced diet, and getting regular exercise Avoiding acid reflux-inducing foods and drinks, such as overly fatty food, caffeinated beverages, chocolate and alcohol Quitting smoking Avoiding late or overly large meals Q: What is the relationship between GERD and a hiatal hernia? A: Hiatal hernia is a condition involving the upper section of the stomach pushing through the diaphragm, the muscle that divides the abdomen and the chest. This condition can increase the chance of a person experiencing GERD. 14 15 Q: Can alcohol cause GERD? A: Although more conclusive evidence is needed, it seems that there is a relationship between alcohol and an increased likelihood of GERD. 16 9 People who regularly consume alcohol and experience GERD should consider cutting down on their alcohol intake to help manage the condition."

    "condition": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/generalized-anxiety-disorder/",
    "what_is_generalized_anxiety_disorder": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a condition characterized by debilitating, excessive, unfocused worrying and anxiety. While occasional feelings of anxiety are a normal part of life, people with generalized anxiety disorder tend to experience a loss of control over their thoughts. 1 This significant anxiety can cause a person with GAD to struggle to function in important areas of life, such as socially or professionally. 2 Even everyday tasks may become difficult to complete. In addition to prolonged and excessive feelings of anxiety, people with GAD may also experience physical symptoms, such as restlessness, muscle tension and difficulty sleeping. 3 Generalized anxiety disorder can appear at any age, but it often begins in adolescence or early adulthood. 4 GAD is generally a long-term condition, and people with this condition tend to experience fluctuations in their level of anxiety over time. 5 It is believed that around 5-10 percent of the U.S. general population are affected by generalized anxiety disorder at some point during their lifetime. 6 7 8 Treatment usually focuses on helping the person to manage the effects of GAD. Typically, a doctor will recommend treatment through psychotherapy, medication or, most often, a combination of the two. With effective treatment and support, it is often possible for an individual with GAD to manage the disorder and function effectively in everyday life. 9",
    "other_types": "Generalized anxiety disorder is a type of anxiety disorder. A number of different conditions fall under the category of anxiety disorder, each characterized by feelings of excessive anxiety, fear and/or worry. Alongside GAD, other anxiety disorders include: 4 7 10 Panic disorder, resulting in recurrent and unexpected panic attacks , often without an established trigger. Social anxiety disorder, significant fear or anxiety of one or more social situations, where the person may feel scrutinized or negatively judged by others. Separation anxiety disorder, where a person experiences significant and persistent worry relating to the separation from or loss of, home or a significant person in their life, usually a parent or caregiver. It may be accompanied by physical symptoms including headache and stomachache. Although separation anxiety is a normal developmental stage in early childhood, it becomes a disorder in more developmentally mature children and is the most common anxiety disorder of childhood. Adults and adolescents may also suffer from this disorder, though it is much less common. Agoraphobia, an intense fear of situations where help or escape are perceived as being difficult, such as crowded places, enclosed spaces, moving vehicles or remote spaces. Specific phobias, intense fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation. Examples of common phobias are spiders, heights, flying and injections Although each of these disorders can result in feelings of anxiety and fear, they are distinct conditions that may require different approaches and treatment. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety that is either nonspecific, or focuses on certain general themes, such as work, health or safety. 7 Good to know: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) , acute stress disorder (ASD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are no longer considered anxiety disorders, although they are closely related. 4",
    "symptoms": "The most common and troublesome symptom of generalized anxiety disorder is persistent, invasive, and uncontrollable anxiety or worry. Unlike other types of anxiety disorder, people with GAD can experience anxiety around any issue or situation. Anxiety-related signs to look out for that may indicate GAD include: 3 9 7 Excessive anxiety and worry that is present on more days than not, for six months or longer Anxiety that significantly interferes with daily life, affecting things such as attention to tasks and normal social and occupational functioning Anxiety or worry that is stronger than is appropriate for the situation Anxiety or worry that is focused on various events or activities Difficulty controlling the feelings of anxiety Worries that may change over time Physical manifestations of anxiety, such as restlessness, muscle tension, irritability and sleep disturbances The levels of anxiety experienced often fluctuate and can intensify during times of stress, e.g. new job, moving house, relationship changes. Common areas that can cause anxiety in a person with GAD include: 9 Work Health Family and other relationships Safety Finances Worried you may be experiencing generalized anxiety disorder?  Download the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nThe presentation of generalized anxiety disorder is consistent across all ages, with both children and adults experiencing similar symptoms. However, children generally experience more physical symptoms than adults and often have complaints such as stomachache or headache. Additionally, the focus of the anxiety often differs between age groups. For example, while adults are more likely to worry about the wellbeing of themselves and their family, children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry more about: 11 12 Academic performance Sporting events at school Natural disasters Children with GAD may also appear overly perfectionistic, self-critical or reassurance-seeking. This can be a defence mechanism against concerns they are feeling  relating to their own self-worth and performance. 11 Furthermore, adolescents tend to experience more severe symptoms than adults or children. Good to know: Children with GAD can often present with physical complaints and irritability as significant symptoms. However, these are symptoms of pediatric anxiety disorders in general and are not specific to GAD. 13",
    "causes_and_risk_factors_for_generalized_anxiety_disorder": "GAD is a common disorder, believed to affect around 5-10 percent of people in the U.S. at some point during their lives. 6 7 8 However, despite its prevalence, GAD’s exact cause is still unknown. Although some people may develop generalized anxiety disorder for no apparent reason, there are a number of risk factors which are believed to play a role in causing generalized anxiety disorder. These include: 3 4 9 7 11 14 15 16 Gender. Women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with GAD as men, though this difference may be the result of the underdiagnosis of men Genetics. Having a predisposition towards GAD can run in families Age. The median age at onset for GAD is 30 years old, which is later than other anxiety disorders. However, a very broad range exists for the age of onset. GAD may develop gradually, beginning at a younger age and presenting initially as an anxious temperament. Substance abuse. Alcohol and drug abuse often occur simultaneously with GAD. An anxiety disorder that is believed to have resulted due to substance or medication intake is often referred to as a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Mental health. People with GAD commonly suffer from other anxiety conditions, as well as depression . Stress. Stressful life experiences, such as the death of a family member may contribute towards the condition. This is also true for continual stressors relating to ongoing situations, such as working in a high-pressure environment The role of genetics and environment as  contributing factors for the development of anxiety disorders is an ongoing area of research. However, it is generally believed that there is no single cause of generalized anxiety disorder, and instead, it occurs as a combination of biological and social factors. 4 7",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder may be made by a doctor or psychologist following an assessment of the person’s symptoms and personal history. There are specific clinical criteria to help diagnose generalized anxiety disorder. 2 This can help doctors to differentiate GAD from normal feelings of anxiety that arise in everyday life, as well as from other conditions that may be causing the symptoms. In order to receive a diagnosis of GAD, a person must exhibit a specific set of symptoms in addition to: 2 7 8 Excessive, nonspecific anxiety that is difficult to control and has occurred on more days than not during a six month period Affected people must also display three or more of the following symptoms: Restlessness Muscle tension Difficulty sleeping Fatigue Difficulty concentrating Irritability Even if the requisite symptoms are present, a doctor may suggest further tests before making a diagnosis to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. These tests can include physical examination and blood tests . Other conditions and substances can cause similar symptoms to GAD. Therefore, a doctor will need to exclude the following prior to making a diagnosis of GAD: 7 17 18 Other anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and specific phobias Other mental health disorders, including depression , schizophrenia , obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) , acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Dementia Hyperthyroidism Substance abuse Prescription medication side-effects Good to know: It is important for doctors to rule out other possible causes of anxiety, as the precise contributing factors are likely to influence the recommended treatment methods. If you think you may have generalized anxiety disorder, you can share your symptoms and begin your personal health assessment using the free Ada app .",
    "treatment": "The treatment of generalized anxiety disorder usually involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication, 4 with treatment aimed at managing the symptoms of the disorder. While some people make a full recovery, for most people GAD is a long-term condition that requires ongoing management with psychotherapy and/or medication. This usually allows people with the disorder to lead an otherwise healthy life. 19\n\nPsychotherapy is a psychology-based treatment method that is often referred to as talk therapy . 20 There are a number of different types of psychotherapy, some of which can be used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nCBT is a form of psychotherapy that is often used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. 9 Treatment using CBT takes place over a number of sessions, during which a trained psychologist or psychiatrist discusses a person’s problems with them. Thought processes that are contributing to anxiety are identified, and suggestions are made and discussed to help the person deal with these negative thoughts and behaviors. CBT can be carried out one on one, or in a group setting. 19 CBT aims to equip people with skills and strategies to enable them to: 21 Recognize harmful or irrational thoughts and behaviors Gain control of negative thought processes using specific stress management techniques Alter negative behaviors accordingly\n\nDoctors often prescribe medication to people with generalized anxiety disorder, usually in addition to psychotherapy, as the combination of the two has been suggested to be more effective than medication alone. However, the efficacy of combining medication and psychotherapy to treat GAD is an ongoing area of research. 22 Antidepressants, often used to treat depression , can also be beneficial in the treatment of GAD. Two types of antidepressant medication often used to treat GAD are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). 8 Buspirone, a type of drug that also affects serotonin levels in the brain, has also been shown to be effective at reducing symptoms of GAD. 23 SSRIs, SNRIs and buspirone medication can take at least two weeks to begin working. Benzodiazepines, another type of anti-anxiety medication , are sometimes prescribed on an urgent basis to manage anxiety symptoms in the short-term. Benzodiazepines, however, are not a suitable long-term treatment option, as they very often lead to drug dependency. 7\n\nVarious self-help techniques can be used to help manage the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. However, these self-help measures are best used as part of a controlled treatment plan, and are often suggested by a doctor alongside psychotherapy and/or prescription medication. 24 Possible self-help techniques include: 1 24 25 Exercise Healthy diet Meditation Relaxation techniques, including controlled breathing and muscle relaxation A reliable source of emotional support may also help ease stress. A support person may also help a person with GAD recognize the signs of worsening anxiety and support the person in seeking appropriate help. Emotional support may come from family, friends or even support groups. However, this is not a replacement for psychotherapy or prescription medication. 9 Good to know: Once treatment has begun, the progress of people with generalized anxiety disorder will be regularly monitored. The frequency of this depends on the severity of the disorder as well as the chosen treatment methods, but often starts with reviews every four to eight weeks. 24 These reviews allow healthcare professionals to track the success of the chosen treatment methods and, if they are not suitably effective, potentially modify the approach. 25",
    "preventing_generalized_anxiety_disorder": "Although research has provided some evidence that the risk of developing generalized anxiety disorder can be minimized in certain groups, anxiety prevention is a relatively new field of research, and studies are still ongoing. 6 26",
    "other_names_for_generalized_anxiety_disorder": "GAD Anxiety disorder Generalised anxiety disorder",
    "generalized_anxiety_disorder_faqs": "Q: What are the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder? A: The main symptom of GAD is anxiety that is excessive and difficult to control. The source of the anxiety can be anything, but worries around general areas such as work, health and relationships are common. Other symptoms of GAD that may accompany the feelings of anxiety, include: Restlessness Muscle tension Difficulty sleeping Fatigue Difficulty concentrating Irritability A person with GAD may also display physical signs linked to their feelings of anxiousness, such as sweating, trembling and increased heart rate. Q: Is there a test to check for generalized anxiety disorder A: Although there is not a single test that will confirm the diagnosis of GAD, there is specific diagnostic criteria that is based on the presence of certain signs and symptoms. This diagnostic criteria usually allows doctors to make a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder based on a clinical evaluation of a person’s symptoms. It is important, however, to differentiate GAD from other types of anxiety disorders as well as any other factors that may be causing or contributing to anxiety, e.g. depression or drug misuse. A doctor may therefore suggest additional tests, such as physical examination and blood tests to exclude other possible causes. Q: Are there different types of anxiety disorders? A: Yes, there are a number of different types of anxiety disorders of which generalized anxiety disorder is one. Other types of anxiety disorders are: Panic disorder Social anxiety disorder Separation anxiety disorder Agoraphobia Specific phobias Each of these anxiety disorders is a distinct condition that requires its own approach and management. Q: Can medication be used to treat generalized anxiety disorder? A: Yes, medication is often used to treat GAD and is generally prescribed alongside a program of psychotherapy. Combining the two treatment methods aims to help the affected person both manage their symptoms as well as address their negative thought and behavior patterns. Q: Can children have generalized anxiety disorder? A: Yes. GAD is the most common anxiety disorder in children. The symptoms experienced by children may be similar to those of adults, but children tend to have more physical symptoms, and their anxiety focuses on different themes than adults, such as school performance. Treatment of childhood generalized anxiety disorder is usually accomplished through psychotherapy and, potentially, also prescription medication. 27 Research into pediatric anxiety disorders has shown a genetic link in the disorders, where a child of a parent that suffers from an anxiety disorder, is more likely to suffer from an anxiety disorder themselves. However, both genetic and environmental factors can place a child at higher risk of developing GAD. Q: Are generalized anxiety disorder and depression related? A: Although generalized anxiety disorder and depression are two separate conditions, there is the high possibility of a person with one of these disorders to develop the other. This is due to the similarities in brain abnormalities that causes similar symptoms in both conditions. 28 Such symptoms include restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and difficulty sleeping. 29 There are, however, some key differences between the two. People with GAD tend to feel anxious about the future, whereas people with depressive disorders are more likely to be past-oriented. Furthermore, mood swings and suicidal thoughts are uncommon in GAD, but are common in people with depressive disorders. 7 If you are concerned you may have symptoms of anxiety or depression, you can use the Ada app to carry out a free symptom assessment."

    "condition": "Generalized Seizure",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/generalized-seizure/",
    "what_is_a_generalized_seizure": "A generalized seizure occurs when there is a disturbance in the electrical activity on both sides of the brain, potentially resulting in a loss of bodily control and, usually, consciousness. There are several different types of generalized seizures, all with varying symptoms. 1 Seizures tend to last only a few seconds or minutes. If a seizure lasts longer than this, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. 2 The affected person will typically be able to return to normal after it has taken place, but complications can arise, such as injury from collapsing or an inability to regain consciousness. The tendency to have repeated seizures is known as epilepsy, a condition that affects around 1 in 100 people in the US. 3 However, a single seizure does not mean the affected person is epileptic.\n\nEpilepsy with generalized seizures is mostly idiopathic, meaning there is no definitive cause. People with a family history of the condition, however, are more likely to be diagnosed. In most cases, generalized seizures will begin during childhood or adolescence. 2 Sometimes, however, epilepsy can be triggered by another condition, such as brain trauma or a Stroke . There is no cure for epilepsy, but seizures may stop or reduce as a person gets older. The majority of those affected by epilepsy can control the condition through medication. 4",
    "signs_and_differences": "A person affected by epilepsy with generalized seizures may experience one or more of several different types of seizures .\n\nThere are certain signs and symptoms that can indicate that a seizure is about to occur . These signs and symptoms typically manifest in advance of the specific symptoms of a seizure and are collectively known as an aura. However, auras do not always occur in those affected by epilepsy, and some with the condition may never experience one. An aura can be identified by the following: 4 5 Unusual movements Intense emotions Numbness Dread or anxiety Pain\n\nTonic-clonic seizures are the most common type of generalized seizure. 1 Historically, they have also been known as grand-mal seizures. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure begins with what is known as the tonic phase, during which the following symptoms typically occur: 4 6 All muscles stiffen The affected person generally falls and loses consciousness Air is forced out of the lungs, often causing a groan The jaw contracts Saliva may escape from the mouth The affected person may bite their cheek or tongue This is followed by the clonic phase, during which the affected person’s limbs begin to jerk rapidly about. These shaking movements should stop after a few minutes. It may take some time to recover consciousness after this phase. The following may also occur during a tonic-clonic seizure: 4 6 The face may turn a blue color due to difficulty breathing Loss of bowel control Confusion and irritability after waking up Muscle pain from the contractions\n\nAbsence seizures , otherwise known as petit-mal seizures, are characterized by the affected person’s tendency to stare into space, often without anyone noticing. As a result, the condition is often confused with daydreaming. Absence seizures are more likely to be experienced by children, with adults rarely affected. An absence seizure usually lasts for around 10 seconds and can be identified by the following symptoms: 7 8 A sudden loss of consciousness with no fall The eyes are staring blankly into space All activity ceasing The eyelids fluttering Read more about Childhood Absence Epilepsy » A less common seizure with very similar effects also exists; this is called an atypical absence seizure. In this type, the loss of awareness can be more gradual than in a typical absence seizure, but the effects typically last for a longer period of time. Changes in muscle activity can occur in both typical and atypical absence seizures, but they are often more noticeable during an atypical seizure. These changes can include: 8 9 Mouth movements, such as chewing or lip smacking Hand movements, such as the rubbing of the fingers Repeated blinking Slumping or falling down\n\nDuring a tonic seizure , the affected person’s muscle tone increases greatly, leading the body to tense up and become stiff. The affected person may fall over if they are standing when the seizure starts. Unlike a tonic-clonic seizure, a tonic seizure does not always lead to loss of consciousness or awareness. A tonic seizure usually lasts for fewer than 20 seconds. 10\n\nAlso known as a drop attack, an atonic seizure causes a rapid decrease in muscle strength. This can lead to the affected person falling to the floor, though consciousness is usually retained.\n\nMyoclonic seizures occur when the body jerks for a very short period, usually less than a second. Any part of the body can be affected, but the arms are the most common location. The effects of a myoclonic seizure are often minimal, but can sometimes cause the affected person to drop or throw an object they are holding. 1\n\nClonic seizures are a rare type of seizure, most common in infant children. 11 During a clonic seizure, the affected person’s body jerks around repeatedly as a result of the body’s muscles rapidly contracting and relaxing. This occurs without the tonic or stiffening phase observable in a tonic-clonic seizure. Symptoms usually last for under a minute.\n\nFocal or partial seizures start in one side of the brain. At first, they will only affect the parts of the body that the affected part of the brain controls. A simple focal seizure may cause unusual physical feelings or force involuntary movements in one limb. A complex focal seizure will impair the affected person’s awareness and can bring on a temporary loss of consciousness. Sometimes focal seizures can spread to the other side of the brain and turn into a generalized seizure, which is then called a secondary generalized seizure.",
    "what_causes_a_generalized_seizure": "When the flow of electrical signals in the brain gets disrupted, the abnormal activity may cause a seizure. The exact cause of an electrical disturbance behind a seizure is often unknown. As many as 1 in 10 people will have a seizure in their lifetime and many will never experience one again. 12 Others will experience them as part of a secondary condition that counts generalized seizures as a symptom.\n\nIdiopathic epilepsy means that there is no clear cause for the neurological disorder, though hereditary factors may play a role in some cases. 12 60 percent of people with epilepsy have idiopathic epilepsy, making it the most common form of the disorder. The majority of those affected by idiopathic epilepsy will not be diagnosed with any other brain condition. ref1\n\nWhen the cause of epilepsy is identifiable, such as historic brain trauma or a diagnosed brain condition, then it is known as symptomatic epilepsy or secondary epilepsy, because it is not the primary cause of the condition. Causes of symptomatic epilepsy include: 1 12 Historic brain trauma An abnormally formed brain Brain infections such as encephalitis, neurocysticercosis or meningitis Low birth weight or lack of oxygen while in the womb Cerebral palsy Brain tumors or growths Strokes that restrict oxygen to the brain\n\nIf a generalized seizure has an identifiable cause, but is unlikely to recur in the absence of that cause, then it is not judged to be epileptic. Some of the causes of this type of generalized seizure can include: 13 14 Alcohol withdrawal Pre or post-pregnancy eclampsia Low or very high blood sugar Disturbances in blood salt levels Lack of sleep Stress or anxiety Hunger\n\nThere are some triggers that can make seizures more likely in those affected by epilepsy, as well as those who have never had a seizure before, but who are susceptible. These include: 1 14 Stress or anxiety Lack of sleep Quickly flashing or strobe lighting Recreational drug use Some prescription medications, including antidepressants Drinking large amounts of alcohol Low or very high blood sugar levels Menstruation Exposure to lead, carbon monoxide or other toxins",
    "generalized_seizure_diagnosis": "If a person is affected by symptoms consistent with a seizure, then it is recommended that they visit a medical professional. To determine whether the affected person is epileptic, questions will be asked about the symptoms being experienced, and several tests may be run to see if a cause can be determined. The medical professional may ask whether the affected person has a family history of epilepsy or any of the conditions that make epilepsy more likely. Several tests can be run to check whether a person may be epileptic. However, no one test can determine for sure that a diagnosis of epilepsy should be made. A doctor will typically be unable to confirm a diagnosis of epilepsy until at least a second seizure has taken place. What appears to be a generalized seizure may sometimes be down to another, non-epileptic condition, such as a panic attack or tourette's syndrome. 14\n\nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) measures the electrical signals passing through the brain to see if there are any abnormalities. To perform the test, a number of electrode patches are attached to the affected person’s scalp, with the test taking around 20 to 30 minutes. If the test shows a positive result for abnormal activity, this may suggest a certain type of epilepsy, which can help a medical professional in making their diagnosis. 14 Someone who has experienced a seizure may show no abnormal brain activity in an EEG. This may be because the abnormal activity may only show up while the seizure is taking place, or it takes place in a part of the brain that the EEG does not reach. Unusual brain activity can also be recorded, even if the affected person does not have epilepsy. 1 This is why it is useful for an EEG test to take place within 24 hours of the suspected seizure. EEG tests are also more likely to be accurate if they take place when the affected person is tired or drowsy. 14\n\nSeveral brain scans may be used to help with diagnosis following a generalized seizure. Some of the most common of these are: 3 14 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Computed tomography (CT) scans Positron emission tomography (PET) scans MRI scans and CT scans analyse the structure of the brain to allow doctors to see if there are any abnormalities, such as tumors, that might be causing the seizure. PET scans look at how certain areas of the brain are functioning and can offer clues as to where the seizure originated from.\n\nSome of the conditions that are associated with symptomatic epilepsy and seizures are detectable through blood tests. Blood tests are able to measure: 3 14 Blood sugar levels Organ function The presence of an infection Blood pressure The presence of a blood condition, such as anemia Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nThere are various conditions that may resemble a general seizure but are caused by factors other than electrical activity in the brain. These are known as non-epileptic events or non-epileptic seizures. Some conditions that may be mistaken for generalized seizures include: 1 14 15 Panic attacks Fainting Collapsing due to irregular heart beats (cardiac arrhythmia) Collapsing due to other heart conditions Tourette syndrome tics and involuntary movements Children holding their breath for extended periods Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, which are seizures caused by psychological reasons, e.g., high emotions or stress",
    "generalized_seizure_treatment": "Treatment for generalized seizures depends on the diagnosis that has been made. If the affected person has epilepsy, then in most situations medication can be used to control their condition. However, if the seizure has only occurred once, then it is unlikely that medication will be prescribed at that stage. 14 ref1 Following two to five years of seizure-free treatment with medication, 70 percent of children and 60 percent of adults with epilepsy can have their drugs withdrawn with no subsequent relapse of symptoms. 12\n\nMany different types of medication are used to control seizures. Only 20 percent of those affected by epilepsy do not have their seizures halted or dramatically reduced by anti-seizure medication. 1 Some of the prescribing considerations, which a medical professional may make in recommending which type to use, include:  ref1 14 Type of seizure How regular the seizures are Age of the affected person Lifestyle of the affected person, including diet Other medications used Whether the affected person is pregnant or attempting pregnancy Usually, just one type of anti-seizure medication is required, rather than a combination. All medications have benefits and side effects. The side effects are usually minor and will be outlined by the doctor. However, if there is a serious impact on the affected person, then regulating the dose or switching to a new type of medication might be recommended. A doctor should be informed if a person affected by epilepsy is pregnant or attempting to become pregnant while on anti-seizure medication. Some anti-seizure medications will impact the effectiveness of other drugs taken at the same time, including the oral contraceptive pill. 1 In certain cases, doctors may recommend stopping the use of anti-seizure medication, for example, if a number of years have passed since a seizure has taken place. However, stopping the use of medication is dangerous if done without first consulting a healthcare professional and may lead to the return of seizures. 14\n\nA high-fat, low-carbohydrate, low-protein ketogenic diet is sometimes recommended as a treatment for epilepsy. It can be useful for children affected by forms of epilepsy that are resistant to anti-seizure medication. The ketogenic diet forces the body to use fat, rather than glucose, as its primary energy source. 16 This diet has been shown to reduce the number of seizures experienced by people affected by several different types of epilepsy. However, it is a difficult diet to maintain and may lead to health issues if incorrectly followed, so the advice of a dietician is recommended.\n\nVery rarely, a person affected by generalized seizures may be recommended for surgery. Mostly, surgical treatment is recommended for those with focal seizures that start in a small, identifiable part of the brain. One example of where surgery could be appropriate is for children affected by focal seizures that regularly spread and become generalized seizures. Brain surgery, like all surgery, has risks including damage to the brain that could cause physical or mental impairment. However, if medications stop working then it may be the most effective way for an affected person to halt their seizures. 14\n\nA vagus nerve stimulator is an electronic device which is implanted underneath the affected person’s skin and attached to the vagus nerve near to the left collarbone. The stimulator sends electrical energy to the brain through the nerve, which can lessen the impact of a seizure or reduce the likelihood of one taking place. 1 The vagus nerve stimulator is not usually a replacement for medication, but is often used alongside it. Another method that makes use of electronic signals to moderate the effects of epilepsy is called responsive stimulation. This uses a device to monitor brain activity and respond with electronic stimulation if it detects a seizure is about to take place. 14",
    "generalized_seizure_prevention": "Idiopathic epilepsy can not be prevented. However, the following may help prevent epilepsy caused by external factors: 12 14 Taking steps to avoid head trauma, such as wearing seatbelts in cars or helmets while cycling Preventing a lack of oxygen supply to the brain through such measures as effective medical treatment before and after childbirth Preventing infections through receiving appropriate vaccinations, for example Avoiding high blood-pressure or heart disease through the maintenance of a nutritionally balanced diet and regular exercise",
    "generalized_seizure_complications": "Given the success rates of anti-seizure medication, the effects of epilepsy can be minimal for many affected by the condition. However, there are several complications that can arise for those experiencing general seizures, either regularly or intermittently.\n\nBecause generalized seizures can happen at any time, they can have a considerable impact on the affected person’s wellbeing. The rate of depression and anxiety among those affected by epilepsy is considerably higher than among the general population. 17 18\n\nGiven the loss of bodily control and consciousness that can occur during a generalized seizure, there are added dangers for those affected by epilepsy. If seizures are a regular occurrence, then any activity where a sudden loss of concentration would cause a precarious situation, such as swimming or weight lifting, might be a risk. Falling to the floor suddenly and the rapid muscle contraction that follows also carries the risk of injury to the body. There may be steps the affected person can take to create a safe environment at home such as covering sharp edges and installing smoke detectors. 19 Employers in the U.S. generally do not have the right to deny employment to a person affected by epilepsy for safety reasons if reasonable adjustments can be made to ensure that the affected person poses no significant danger to themselves or others. 20\n\nIn most U.S. states, a person affected by regular seizures will need to produce a document showing they have been seizure-free for a certain period of time in order to be eligible for a driving license. The time period varies by state, but it is usually between a few months and a year. 21\n\nIf a seizure lasts for over five minutes, or repeated seizures occur without the affected person regaining consciousness, then this is called status epilepticus. This is a life-threatening condition, and medical treatment should be sought immediately. 15\n\nOne in every 1,000 people with epilepsy die suddenly for reasons that are poorly understood by medical professionals. The risk is higher for those who are experiencing regular seizures. The risk of SUDEP may be lowered if anti-seizure medication is taken at the prescribed levels. 14",
    "generalized_seizure_faqs": "Q: What should I do if I see someone having a seizure A: If you see someone having a seizure, and they are not in a dangerous location, such as on a busy street, do not attempt to: Restrict them Move them Stop them moving The following are actions that can be taken to help: Put a soft object underneath the person’s head if they have fallen to the floor Make sure that any tight clothing around their neck, for example a tie, is loosened When any jerking movements have stopped, lay them on their side to make sure they do not choke on their own vomit Take note of the time the seizure starts and ends. If any of the following occurs, then contact emergency medical services: The seizure lasts for more than five minutes The person does not regain consciousness Another seizure begins before they have regained consciousness"

    "what_is_genital_herpes": "Genital herpes is a viral condition which causes blisters on the genitals. It is a common condition that can affect both men and women, usually caused by herpes simplex virus 2 and sometimes by herpes simplex virus 1. This condition is contagious and is transmitted through direct physical contact, usually sexual contact. The blisters associated with genital herpes are often stinging or painful, and people with this condition may also have a fever or swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin. Treatment involves antivirals, such as aciclovir, in cream or tablet form. The symptoms of this condition tend to be recurring, especially when a person feels stressed or unwell.",
    "causes_and_risk_factors": "Genital herpes is caused by the human herpes simplex virus (HSV) , specifically HSV-2 and HSV-1. This virus is spread through skin contact, genital contact or oral contact with people who have the virus. 1 Good to know: HSV-1 and HSV-2 infect the cells of the top layer of the skin, the epithelium, and the mucus membranes. After an episode of symptoms, the virus lies dormant in the nerve cells; when reactivated by factors such as stress or illness, it travels along the nerves to the skin or mucous membranes. 1 Genital herpes is mostly transmitted during sexual contact. People are usually infected during adolescence or in young adulthood, though infection at any age is possible. People who have other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are more likely to have genital herpes. It is estimated that one in five women and one in nine men between the ages of 14 and 49 have a genital HSV-2 infection. 2 More women than men have genital herpes as it is easier for men to transmit HSV-2 to women than it is for women to transmit the virus to men. 3 Good to know: While most cases of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection cause either oral or genital ulcers, it is also possible to develop herpetic ulcers on the fingers and thumb. This is known as a herpetic whitlow and is often found among healthcare workers. Herpetic whitlow is more often caused by HSV-1 than HSV-2. 4 Read more about Human Herpesvirus (HHV) » Factors that make passing on the virus more likely include: 2 5 Multiple sex partners, both current and across the lifetime Unprotected vaginal or oral sex Sharing sex toys without using a new condom for each partner or proper cleaning between uses Skin-to-skin contact with ulcers during sex or other intimate contact Receiving oral sex from a partner with an active cold sore Not recognizing the presence of ulcers Sex with a partner with an uncircumcised penis Touching the genital or anal area with a herpetic whitlow on the hand. Like all herpes viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 can lie dormant in the body between active episodes. Certain factors can cause the virus to reactivate, including: 6 Stress Illness, which can weaken the immune system Surgery or injury Extreme heat or cold weather Menstruation Fever. If you are experiencing these or other symptoms about which you are concerned, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptoms of genital herpes are : 2 3 4 5 Itching or pain in or on the genital areas Followed by small, fluid-filled blisters. These blisters developing into crusted sores. The symptoms may last for up to two weeks. The first time a person has an outbreak of genital herpes, the blisters may be very painful. Other symptoms include: Fever Feeling unwell Pain when passing urine Muscle aches Swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin. These symptoms may occur from time to time, especially when unwell or at times of stress.\n\nMen and women experience the same symptoms when affected by genital herpes. Symptoms of genital herpes in adults and sexually active teenagers usually have a prodromal phase, in which the affected person may feel generally unwell and also experience: 5 Tiredness Headache Fever Swollen lymph glands Aches and pain in the lower back, groin and legs. The affected person may also experience a tingling, itching or stinging sensation in the genital or anal area for between two hours and five days before the skin lesions appear. 2 6 The prodromal phase is followed by the development of lesions of the skin and mucous membranes, and can be located on the: 2 5 Penis Labia Vagina Buttocks Thighs These lesions begin as blisters, progress to red spots, then to fluid-filled blisters, which burst within a few days and become ulcers. 2 6 The first episode of genital herpes is usually the longest and most painful one the affected person will experience, with later episodes being generally shorter and less uncomfortable. People with genital herpes caused by HSV-1 are thought to experience fewer recurrences of the symptoms. Good to know: About 66 percent of people with genital herpes do not show symptoms, but can still pass on the virus to their partners. 6 If you are concerned that you or someone you care for may be experiencing the symptoms of genital herpes, you can check the symptoms at any time using the free Ada app .",
    "diagnosing_genital_herpes": "The diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and the appearance of herpes blisters. Testing fluid from the blister for the herpes simplex virus can confirm the diagnosis.\n\nFour main types of test are used to diagnose genital herpes: 3 5 7 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is accurate and fast Direct fluorescent antibody, which is relatively quick and can identify specific strains of the virus Type-specific serological tests, which tests for type-specific antibodies that develop in the first weeks after infection Human herpesvirus culture, which requires a sample of fluid taken from an active lesion Doctors decide which test to use based on the presentation of the condition. Culture and PCR testing are generally chosen for cases where there are active lesions. 7 The Tzanck smear method, while previously widely used, is now considered to be relatively insensitive and nonspecific compared to PCR and viral HSV culture. Good to know: Genital herpes cannot be diagnosed by pap smear or routine blood tests.\n\nTesting for genital herpes is generally widely available through general practitioners, gynecologists, and specialized sexual health clinics. People who should consider being tested for genital herpes include: 2 3 People with a partner who reports genital herpes or shows symptoms of it People with multiple sexual partners People who have recently had unprotected sex with a new partner People who are HIV-positive Men who have sex with men People who have another sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia People who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. It is important to note that the best time to be tested is while symptoms are present.",
    "treatment_for_genital_herpes": "In mild cases, where there are few blisters and the affected person is otherwise well, treatment may consist of antiviral creams. Tablets are also available to help prevent or reduce the symptoms of an outbreak of blisters. Severe or complicated cases need antiviral medication intravenously, i.e. through a drip. Pregnant women with genital herpes should be checked regularly; babies born vaginally can catch the herpes virus from their mother, and this may put the baby at risk for serious complications.\n\nTreatment for genital herpes is intended to manage the infection rather than cure it. Genital herpes cannot be cured. 1 Antiviral treatment does, however, reduce the duration of the outbreak and decrease the likelihood of the virus being passed on to others. To be maximally effective, antiviral treatment has to be started as early as possible, while the lesions are still forming or even before, when the prodromal symptoms are felt. Antiviral drugs used in the treatment of genital herpes include: 1 2 Aciclovir Famciclovir Valaciclovir Good to know: Because genital herpes is the result of a viral infection, antibiotics are not effective. Antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections. Furthermore, topical creams intended for the treatment of cold sores are not effective against genital herpes. In some cases, where the affected person experiences frequent or prolonged outbreaks, a longer-term course of oral antivirals may be prescribed to reduce the severity of episodes. 1\n\nBecause herpes cannot be totally eliminated from the body, episodes can recur throughout life. Some remedies that people affected by an active episode of genital herpes can use to relieve the discomfort are: 1 5 Using acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, or ibuprofen to manage the pain Applying ice packs to the affected area of skin Wearing loose-fitting clothes and underwear made from breathable, natural fibers such as cotton Good to know: Never apply ice directly to the skin; always wrap it in a clean cloth or plastic bag. Petroleum jelly can damage condoms, contraceptive caps and diaphragms. 5\n\nMany people who are affected by genital herpes deal with feelings of embarrassment, anxiety and low self-esteem. For this reason, many people living with this condition may find counseling helpful. 1",

    "genital_herpes_faqs": "Q: Is genital herpes the only cause of genital ulcers? A: No, but it is one of the most common. Other infectious conditions which can cause ulcers on the genitals include: 2 Syphilis Chancroid, a bacterial infection spread by sexual contact, causing open sores on the genitals Lymphogranuloma venereum, a chronic lymphatic infection caused by the sexually-transmitted bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis . Granuloma inguinale, a bacterial condition caused by Klebsiella granulomatis bacteria, causing genital ulcers Non-infectious conditions include: 2 Trauma Psoriasis, a common skin condition that causes inflammation and a rash Behcet Syndrome, a rare disorder that causes blood vessel inflammation, which can cause mouth ulcers , mucus membrane and skin ulcers. If symptoms are present, but the affected person is unsure what might be causing them, they should see their doctor. Q: For how long is genital herpes contagious? A: HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be shed by the body even when no symptoms are present, so it is possible to contract genital herpes from a partner even when they do not have any active blisters or lesions. 5 Q: What is the effect of genital herpes on pregnancy? A: Genital herpes does not affect fertility in men or women. 8 If a pregnant person contracts genital herpes for the first time, particularly during the first six months of pregnancy, it is possible for the baby to become infected. Herpes infection in newborn babies can be fatal, so it is generally advised that pregnant women avoid close contact with anyone who has oral or genital herpes. 3 However, genital herpes can be treated during pregnancy, and the baby may develop immunity. 5 The risk of passing on an HSV infection during birth is low, but if the condition is contracted during the last three months of a pregnancy, the virus <em>can</em> be passed on to the baby, but there will not be time for the baby to develop immunity. In such situations, the baby can be delivered by a caesarian section. This is because the baby is exposed to the virus when it passes through the cervix and vagina during a vaginal birth, but not during a C-section. Q: Does everyone who has genital herpes show symptoms the same way? A: No. Not everyone with genital herpes experiences the same symptoms, or experiences symptoms in the same way. Many people who have the virus that causes genital herpes do not show any symptoms at all, while others may experience only very mild symptoms. Still others may have severe symptoms. 5 Q: Does genital herpes cause genital warts? A: No. Genital warts are caused by human papillomavirus, HPV, not herpes simplex. Therefore, genital herpes cannot cause genital warts. Read more about Genital Warts » Q: Does genital herpes cause cancer? A: It is not yet known for sure whether herpes simplex 1 or herpes simplex 2 are linked to cancer. However, some studies have shown that cervical and prostate cancer may be linked to HSV-2. 9 10 Medical research into this question is ongoing. Q: What is the relationship between genital herpes and HIV? A: In people with HIV who are not being treated for the condition, an episode of active genital herpes, especially if caused by HSV-2, may make them more likely to pass on HIV to their intimate partners, 11 because the HIV virus is present in the fluid shed by the blisters. By the same token, an HIV-negative person who has active genital herpes blisters may be more likely to contract HIV while the blisters are present, as they create small breaks in the skin through which the virus can easily enter. 3 ref11 People with HIV may experience more frequent episodes of active genital herpes, with more severe symptoms. However, the condition responds to antiviral treatment. 12 Q: Can oral sex pass on genital herpes? A: Yes, but this is relatively rare. It is possible, though not common, to contract genital herpes by receiving oral sex from a partner who has a current episode of oral herpes . HSV-1 is usually the source of genital herpes in such cases. 13 Q: Can anal sex pass on genital herpes? A: Yes, it is possible to pass on the HSV-2 and, more rarely, the HSV-1, virus during anal sex. 14 Q: Can blood contact pass on genital herpes? A: No. Herpes can only be passed on by direct skin contact. 8 Q: Can herpes cause proctitis? A: Yes. Proctitis is an inflammation of the rectum and can be caused by several bacterial and viral infections, including genital herpes. It is a particular risk of unprotected anal sex. It is more common among people with weakened immune systems. 15 Q: Can someone with HSV-1 contract HSV-2, or vice versa? A: Yes. It is possible to have both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Having one virus does not prevent infection by the other. Q: Are there any home remedies to help manage the discomfort caused by genital herpes? A: Yes. Along with using over-the-counter pain medication, people who experience discomfort caused by genital herpes can: Take a warm bath with salt, baking soda or epsom salts added Spread  a thin layer of petroleum jelly on the affected area These do not cure the condition but may help with the discomfort. Q: Can genital herpes be fatal? A: In healthy people with strong immune systems, genital herpes is uncomfortable but not dangerous. However, in newborn babies or people with HIV/AIDS, herpes simplex can spread throughout the body, causing a severe infection that can sometimes be fatal if not promptly and adequately treated. Immunosuppressed or immunocompromised people with HSV may develop pneumonia, encephalitis, hepatitis or a disseminated herpes infection, which may be fatal. 16"

    "what_are_genital_warts": "Genital warts (condylomata acuminata or anogenital warts) are the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) and a symptom of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection — a very common and highly contagious skin infection. Although HPV comes in over 100 different types, 90 percent of all cases of genital warts are caused by strains 6 and 11. 1 Accordingly, only 10 percent of those who contract the virus will develop visible warts.\n\nEven if they are unaware of its presence, most sexually active people will contract HPV at some point during their lifetime. It is passed on through skin-to-skin contact, most commonly through oral, vaginal or anal intercourse. Although the warts rarely cause any long-term harm, they are generally considered unsightly and may cause psychological distress. There is no cure for genital warts or HPV, meaning treatment options are limited to managing the physical impact.",
    "symptoms": "Most people who contract HPV will not develop any visible symptoms. If genital warts do appear, it can sometimes be a significant amount of time – weeks or even months – after first contracting the infection. Genital warts generally form in clusters, though a single wart can also appear. They normally form on the outside of the body in the genital or anal area, typically on the vagina, labia majora, penile shaft or scrotum. They can also less commonly appear internally; inside the anus, the vagina, the opening of the urethra or on the cervix. Genital warts usually take the form of small bumps of roughly two to three centimeters in diameter and are sometimes described as resembling miniature cauliflowers. They typically cause no pain and minimal discomfort, are red or skin-colored in appearance, and can be either soft or hard to touch. If scratched or excessively disturbed, a wart may bleed.",
    "causes": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes genital warts . This is a skin infection that comes in over 100 different types, each affecting a different part of the body. There are roughly 30 types of HPV that can affect the genital and anal areas, but only two (6 and 11) cause the vast majority (90 percent) of all cases of genital warts. Both men and women can contract the virus and pass it on to others.\n\nGenital warts are spread through skin-to-skin contact, primarily through oral, vaginal or anal sex. 3 Penetrative sex, however, is not necessary for contraction; close genital contact can be enough for HPV to be passed on between two sexual partners. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) is extremely contagious, infection cannot occur through such physical interactions as hugging or kissing, nor through items of clothing or towels. After HPV has been contracted, it is typical for the genital warts to appear in between two weeks and eight months. 4\n\nHPV naturally clears from the body in two years or under in 90 percent of cases. For those who have developed genital warts and seen them disappear, there is a chance of the warts recurring within, or in a small amount of cases, outside of this timeframe.",
    "diagnosing_genital_warts": "Most commonly, visible genital warts will be diagnosed through a routine doctor’s examination and the review of the patient’s medical history. If, however, there is a suspicion of HPV infection without any visible symptoms, other diagnostic routes may be explored. For women, this will most often involve a gynecological exam and Pap test, followed by a tissue biopsy if abnormal cells are detected. Biopsies for men are far more rare and are generally not recommended by doctors.\n\nFor women without visible genital warts, diagnosing the presence of HPV will often involve undergoing a gynecological exam. This exam will typically include a Pap test (sometimes called a Pap smear). 5 A procedure usually used to test for cervical cancer , the Pap test screens the cervix for abnormal cells, which are a possible sign of HPV infection. If abnormal cells are found on the cervix, further tests will be carried out to screen for HPV infection, as well as the presence of cervical cancer.",
    "genital_warts_treatment": "There is no cure for genital warts – no way to remove HPV from the patient's system – meaning that treatment is focussed on removing the warts or preventing them from spreading. The direction that treatment will take depends on the amount of warts present, their location and their physical appearance. Some patients will choose to undergo no treatment for genital warts. This option is perfectly safe but will generally prolong the problem. If the patient does opt for treatment, there are a number of different options to explore: Application of antiviral gels or creams. These solutions are marketed in a number of different varieties but are generally applied by the patient themselves over the course of a number of days or weeks. Side-effects may include itching and mild scarring. Cryotherapy (freezing). Liquid nitrogen is used to rapidly freeze the affected area, resulting in a mild burning sensation. This procedure is usually used for small warts around the penis or vulva. Excision. The warts are surgically removed while the patient is under a local anesthetic. Typically used for small, hardened warts. Electrosurgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts that have not responded to other treatments, this option involves cutting away the bulk of the warts, pressing a metal rod against the affected area and sending an electric current through it to burn away what remains. Laser surgery. Generally used for large clusters of warts or those that are difficult to reach (inside the anus, for example). A specialist will use a laser to burn away the mass of warts while the patient is under regional or general anaesthetic.",
    "prevention": "Although they are not 100 percent reliable, the use of condoms remains the most effective way of preventing the contraction genital warts. There are also HPV vaccines available. These vaccines do not protect against all strains of HPV but may be effective in preventing genital warts.\n\nTo help protect against genital warts, condoms should be used every time vaginal, anal or oral intercourse is engaged in. Apart from celibacy, this is the most effective prevention method currently known of. However, using a condom does not guarantee full protection. The virus may be able to spread from genital skin not covered by the condom.\n\nA HPV vaccine can be effective in preventing genital warts, as well as other conditions including cervical cancer. These vaccines are most effective if given before a young person becomes sexually active and are usually given between 11 and 13 years of age. Catch-up programs are sometimes available up to the age of 26, but vaccination in people over 26 has been shown to be ineffective. There are a number of vaccines available (Gardasil and Cervarix, for example), each protecting against a number of different HPV strains. No vaccine is able to protect against all strains of HPV, nor guarantee defense against all types of genital warts. However, vaccination does significantly lower one’s chances of contracting the HPV.",
    "the_hpv_virus_and_cancer": "The human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes genital warts can also cause several forms of cancers, including: 8 Cervical cancer. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. Strains 16 and 18 are responsible for roughly 70 percent of all cases. The HPV vaccination protects against 70 percent of the HPV strains that cause cervical cancer, meaning that it is effective in preventing the condition but not guaranteed. Anal cancer: An estimated 95 percent of all cases of anal cancer are caused by HPV, with most of these caused by type 16. Oropharyngeal cancer: Roughly 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers (cancers of the middle throat) are caused by HPV. Other forms of cancer: Penile, vulvar and vaginal cancers can also be caused by HPV, with type 16 responsible for most cases.",

    "genital_warts_faqs": "Q: Should sexual intercourse be avoided when genital warts are present? A: Yes. HPV is highly contagious, meaning sexual intercourse should be avoided to prevent passing the virus on. If this is not possible, a condom should be worn. Q: Genital warts during pregnancy, should I be worried? A: Generally, no. It is unlikely that HPV will be passed from mother to babybefore or during childbirth. Q: Can genital warts be contracted from oral sex? A: Yes. To prevent the spread of genital warts through oral sex, a condom should be worn at all times. Q: Can genital warts cause cancer? A: While genital warts themselves cannot be said to cause cancer, some strains of the HPV virus can cause certain types of cancer. Cervical cancer and anal cancer are often linked to HPV infection."

    "what_is_gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea , sometimes known as ‘the clap’, is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacterium named Neisseria Gonorrhoeae . 1 It most commonly infects the lower genital tract , including: 1 2 Urethra Cervix Rectum In addition, the eye can also be involved, causing conjunctivitis and many other spreading infections. N.gonorrheae can also infect the throat 1 2 , and the skin, heart, or joints may also be infected; however, this is rare. 2 Gonorrhoea infection is spread by sexual vaginal, oral or anal contact. The bacteria can also affect pregnant women , and the infection can be passed on to their babies. 3\n\nThere are certain risk factors that can increase the likelihood of contracting a gonorrhea infection. These can include: 5 Being aged 20-29 Unprotected sexual vaginal, oral or anal sex with a partner who has gonorrhea Unprotected sex with multiple partners Current or past history of an STI Inconsistent use of condoms Also, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases of Gonorrhea are estimated to be much higher among men who have sex with men (MSM). 5 If left untreated, gonorrhea infection may cause serious problems such as permanent blindness in a newborn baby. 3 The bacteria can also spread to other parts of the body and lead to other complications. (Read our article about how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases ).",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Gonorrhea symptoms can vary by gender . Some people may have no symptoms at all, and sometimes the effects of the condition are so mild that they may not be noticeable. People affected by gonorrhea in the rectum, throat, and eyes all have symptoms that are specific to those body parts. 3 Symptoms can begin within 2 weeks of being infected with N.gonorrhoeae . 3\n\nUnusual discharge from the urethra (the tube that allows urine to pass out of the body); this can be white, yellow, or green in color Pain or burning sensation while urinating Inflammation (swelling) of the foreskin Pain and tenderness in the testicles – although this is rare Symptoms of prostatitis , which is an inflamed prostate, can also be present in men with a Gonorrhea infection. 3 and additionally include lower back pain. Symptoms can include pain in the lower back and genital area, increased frequency and urge to urinate, and pain or burning sensation while urinating. 3\n\nUnusual vaginal discharge: can be thin, watery and green or yellow in color Pain or burning sensation while urinating Pain or tenderness in the lower abdomen – less common Bleeding between periods, after sex, or heavier periods – less common 3\n\nRectum : itching sensation around the anus, discomfort, pain, discharge, tenesmus (the feeling of the need to pass stools) and bleeding Gonorrhea in throat : infection with no symptoms, but can sometimes lead to a sore throat and swelling in the neck Eyes : if infected semen or vaginal fluid comes into contact with the eyes, this can cause conjunctivitis. Eye involvement can include irritation of the eye, pain, swelling, and discharge. 3",
    "gonorrhea_diagnosis": "A diagnosis of Gonorrhea can be made based on your history, clinical symptoms, a physical examination that is carried out by a doctor, and laboratory testing. 3 6 Laboratory investigations can include: 6 1 Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT): 6 1 Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is generally considered the best-suited test for detecting gonorrhea in the genital area. Urine, urethral, vaginal and cervical samples can be collected and analyzed through NAAT – specimens can be collected using a swab. Samples can be collected by a doctor or healthcare provider, or they can also be collected by the patient themselves (self-collection) While conducting a NAAT for gonorrhea, it's also recommended to test for Chlamydia infection. 1 Gonorrhea culture : A bacterial culture test for gonorrhea can also be used to diagnose an infection. 6 1 This works by taking a sample from the potentially infected site using a cotton-tipped swab. Laboratory technicians will then place the sample in containers and see if Neisseria gonorrhoeae grows. Urine analysis : can be used if there's no discharge from the urethra Gram staining : During a gram stain test, a sample is taken from a person potentially affected with gonorrhea. Several dyes are then applied to the sample, which should show up any Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteria present. However, if the test comes back negative, this does not rule out a gonorrhea infection.",
    "how_to_treat_gonorrhea": "Gonorrhea treatment can be curative with the use of antibiotics. Currently, the CDC recommends a single dose of 500mg intramuscular Ceftriaxone . 1 3 7 Intramuscular means that the medicine is injected into a muscle, so antibiotic injection, therefore, can be in the buttocks or thigh. 1 Resistance to antibiotics has been a growing concern, and N.gonorrhoeae bacteria is highly vulnerable to Ceftriaxone. If you are allergic to penicillin or cephalosporins (such as Ceftriaxone), we advise you to consult an infectious disease specialist for alternative management options. A treatment option that can be considered for those who are allergic can include a combination of: 1 Single-dose intramuscular Gentamicin Oral azithromycin Once treatment is started, symptoms can improve within a few days, however, it may take up to 2 weeks for the pain to disappear completely. 3 You should avoid having sex until you and your partner have been treated to avoid re-infection or passing the bacteria to others. It's recommended that you attend a follow-up visit with your doctor after your treatment is complete to make sure you are free of infection. 3",
    "complications_from_gonorrhea": "Early diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhea are vital. If left untreated, the infection can spread to different parts of the body and lead to serious complications. These can include: 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease : bacterial infection of the cervix, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus (womb). This can lead to: Ectopic pregnancy : a fertilized egg implants itself outside of the womb Infertility in women Infertility in men Blindness Chronic pelvic pain Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome: the gonorrhea bacteria may spread toward to liver and cause perihepatitis (inflammation of the liver capsule) – resolves with antibiotic therapy.",
    "gonorrhea_faqs": "Q: What is gonorrhea? A: Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacterium named Neisseria gonorrhoeae and most commonly affects the lower genital tract, however, the bacteria can also infect the eyes and throat. Q: Is gonorrhea curable? A: Yes, gonorrhea can be cured with the appropriate antibiotic therapy. The most commonly used antibiotic used is a single-dose intramuscular Ceftriaxone. Q: What does gonorrhea look like? A: Gonorrhea typically presents with a discharge from the tip of the penis or vagina. The discharge can be thick, and green or yellow in color. Other symptoms can include a painful sensation when peeing, pain or tenderness. Q: Can you get gonorrhea from kissing? A: No, you can only contract a gonorrhea infection through unprotected sexual vaginal, oral or anal sex with a partner who has gonorrhea. Other risk factors include unprotected sex with multiple partners, current or past history of an STI and inconsistent use of condoms. Q: How long can you have gonorrhea without knowing? A: Symptoms usually start 2-7 days after infection, but it can take up to 30 days to experience symptoms. Q: How to cure gonorrhea without going to the doctor? A: If you suspect a gonorrhea infection, it's advised that you visit your health practitioner immediately and confirm your diagnosis. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, your physician can prescribe you antibiotics for your curative treatment."

    "condition": "Gout",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/gout/",
    "what_is_gout": "Gout is a type of arthritis caused by an excess of a chemical called uric acid, also called urate. This excess acid in the bloodstream can prompt urate crystals to form around certain joints in the body, most often the big toe, resulting in inflammation. Uric acid is increased in the body by eating certain high-purine foods, as well as by drinking alcohol. Treatment usually involves avoiding foods that can cause gout, as well as medications to relieve pain and decrease the amount of uric acid in the body. Many people are able to manage and avoid episodes of gout using these measures. Typical symptoms are severe pain in one or more joints, accompanied by redness, swelling and difficulty moving the joint. It is a painful condition, but one that usually passes within three to 10 days. 1 However if left untreated, episodes of gout can return over time, increase in severity and lead to complications. If you are concerned you may have gout, try using the Ada app to begin your personal health assessment.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of gout typically appear very quickly, often developing over just a few hours. This is known as an attack and can occur without warning. The most common gout symptoms include: 1 2 3 4 Severe pain in a joint, most often the big toe Swelling Redness Joint feels warm to touch Difficulty moving the joint The big toe is the joint most commonly affected, a condition known as podagra . However, gout can affect any joint, such as: 5 Other joints in the foot Fingers Ankles Wrists Knees Elbows Because urate crystals do not form as easily in warm areas, such as sites close to the centre of the body, it is unusual for gout to target more central parts of the body such as the hips, shoulders or spine. This sensitivity to temperature leads to gout symptoms often occurring at night, when the body temperature generally lowers. Additionally, the fluid that has built up in the affected joint during the day will drain away while lying down, resulting in a more concentrated level of uric acid. 6 Less common symptoms of a gout attack can include: 2 7 An increased heart rate Nausea Fever Chills If you are worried that you may have gout, you can start your free symptom assessment with the Ada app .",
    "causes": "Gout is a very common condition affecting roughly one in every 100 adults. Gout tends to affect more men than women and becomes more common with age. 1 Gout is caused by excess uric acid in the bloodstream, a condition also known as hyperuricemia. 4 This excess uric acid can result in urate crystals forming in and around the joints, causing the joint to become inflamed, painful and red. Gout usually occurs in one joint at a time, most often the big toe. Uric acid is produced naturally in the body as a by-product of breaking down purines, a type of chemical compound found in certain foods. 8 Usually, the body passes out excess uric acid in the urine. However, if the kidneys cannot expel enough uric acid, it can build up and cause high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream, a state known as hyperuricemia. 1 Although gout is a possible outcome of hyperuricemia, it is important to note that not all people with hyperuricemia will develop gout. 2",
    "risk_factors": "Gout is a complex disease and there are often a number of risk factors that contribute towards its development.\n\nMost people who suffer from gout have kidneys that cannot eliminate the required amount of uric acid. The inability to expel enough uric acid from the kidneys is typically a genetic trait. Therefore, gout often runs in families and around one in five cases occur in people with a family history of gout. 1\n\nPurine-rich food and drink can increase uric acid levels in the blood and are a risk factor for gout, especially in people who already have problems with uric acid excretion. Such foods include: 1 2 4 Red meat Organ meat e.g. liver, kidney, heart, or sweetbreads Seafoods such as trout, tuna, herring, anchovies, sardines, scallops, or mussels High-fructose food and drink such as candy, soda, canned fruit, sweetened yogurt, salad dressing Mushrooms Asparagus Yeast extracts Alcohol, especially beer, is also high in purines. The risk of gout directly increases with alcohol consumption. 4 Good to know: A high-purine diet is typically more likely to trigger a gout attack in people who are predisposed, either genetically or medically, to problems expelling the necessary levels of uric acid from the body. Consuming purine-rich food and drink can be a contributing factor, but is rarely a sole cause, of gout. 5 Always discuss dietary changes with a doctor.\n\nThere is a direct relationship between obesity and the risk of developing gout. This is because overweight bodies tend to produce more insulin, and insulin can inhibit the kidneys’ ability to expel uric acid. 9\n\nCertain medications may raise the levels of uric acid in the body. These include diuretics, also known as water pills, which work by decreasing the amount of fluid in your body and are often used to treat conditions such as high blood pressure. 10 Aspirin and some chemotherapy medicines have also been shown to raise the body’s uric acid levels. ref1\n\nPeople with certain medical conditions may also be at greater risk of developing gout. These include: 1 2 3 4 Kidney disease or damage High blood pressure, also known as hypertension Diabetes Underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism Congestive heart failure Certain cancers and blood disorders including leukaemia, lymphoma and hemolytic anemia Psoriasis",
    "diagnosing_gout": "Diagnosis of gout is typically based on a patient's medical history, symptoms and a physical examination. Further diagnostic measures taken by doctors may include: 2 11 Taking a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to be tested for urate crystals Blood tests to monitor the amount of uric acid in the blood Ultrasounds or X-rays of the joint to look for signs of damage as a result of gout",
    "treatment": "Gout can often be successfully managed through medication and lifestyle changes. There are two main aims to treating gout: 5 Treating the symptoms of the current gout attack Ongoing treatment to reduce the likelihood of gout returning (see Prevention of gout below) To treat the immediate symptoms of gout, medication may be prescribed by doctors to reduce discomfort and swelling. Such medications include: 1 4 12 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce swelling and pain in the joint. These are most effective when taken soon after symptoms begin Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug. Colchicine is most effective when taken within the first 24 hours of the attack beginning Corticosteroids such as prednisone also help to reduce inflammation and are often prescribed to people at risk of side-effects from other medications In addition to prescription drugs, there are a number of at-home treatments which may help alleviate the initial symptoms of gout: 1 5 Elevate the inflamed area to above the heart to help reduce swelling. The simplest way to do this is to lie down on a bed or sofa and raise the affected joint on a couple of cushions Rest, and avoid vigorous movement as much as possible Place ice against the inflamed joint for 20 minutes at a time to help reduce some of the swelling, heat and pain. Always wrap the ice in a clean towel first to avoid direct contact with the skin During night time, placing a cage or cradle around the affected joint to reduce the weight of bed sheets may provide some pain relief Symptoms from a gout attack usually get better within three to 10 days. However, roughly two in every three people who experience an acute attack of gout will have another one within a year. 1 Therefore, preventative measures are often recommended to minimise the likelihood of gout returning.",
    "preventing_gout": "There are many lifestyle changes that people who are vulnerable to gout can make to reduce the risk of developing the condition. Such changes may also be recommended by a doctor to people who have experienced gout before. Steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing gout include: 1 2 3 4 Maintaining a healthy diet and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods Limiting alcohol intake Losing weight, if necessary Increasing exercise; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adults undertake 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week e.g. brisk walking, swimming or cycling Keeping hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Adults should aim to drink between one and two liters of water every day. Avoid sodas and fruit juices, which can be high in purines and fructose If already taking medication, consult with a doctor to determine if it can increase the risk of gout As well as lifestyle changes, a long-term medication may be prescribed by a doctor to help prevent future attacks of gout. Such medications include: 1 3 4 5 Allopurinol, which reduces the amount of uric acid in the blood. It is often prescribed to people who have already had multiple attacks of gout and can take a couple of months to become fully effective Febuxostat also reduces the amount of uric acid in the body, however it has a number of side-effects and is mostly suggested to people who cannot take allopurinol Uricosuric drugs such as probenecid, which increase the amount of uric acid the kidneys are able to pass out in the urine",
    "complications": "Although gout can be very painful, complications arising from the condition are uncommon. Some people never develop gout again. However, others with this condition experience recurrent flares which, if left untreated, can turn into chronic gout. Chronic gout can lead to various complications including: 2 13 14 15 The development of hard bumps under the skin, known as tophi. Tophi are deposits of urate crystals that build up over time in soft tissues, most often in the feet, hands, ankles, wrists and ears. At this stage of gout the condition is often referred to as chronic tophaceous gout. Over time tophi can damage the tissues around the joints, which can cause arthritis and other permanent joint problems Kidney stones . Approximately 20 percent of people with gout also develop kidney stones due to urate crystals forming in the kidneys, which in turn can lead to kidney damage Joint deformity due to progressive damage of the tissues around the joint A chronic disorder known as osteoarthritis, resulting in persistent pain and stiffness to the joints Early diagnosis and intervention allows most people with gout to make a full recovery. Even people affected by chronic gout can receive treatment to lower the levels of uric acid in the body and resolve certain complications such as tophi and impaired joint function. 16",
    "gout_faqs": "Q: Why does gout occur most often in the foot? A: There are a number of factors that contribute to gout often developing in the foot, in particular the big toe. Firstly, gout is a condition that affects the joints in the body and the foot is home to multiple joints. Secondly, the urate crystals which cause gout form more readily in cool temperatures and the feet are significantly cooler than more central joints in the body such as the hips, shoulders or spine. Thirdly, gout is more likely to target an area that has previously been injured or stressed, making the foot especially susceptible. 17 Q: How long does gout last for? A: An attack of gout usually lasts between three to 10 days. However, anyone who has experienced gout is at a higher risk of developing it again. If left untreated, gout can become a long-term or chronic condition with attacks happening more frequently and with higher intensity. Leaving gout untreated can also lead to further complications such as kidney stones, joint deformity, osteoarthritis and hard bumps forming under the skin known as tophi. Therefore if gout is suspected, a visit to the doctor is always recommended. Q: What is the difference between primary and secondary gout? A: Primary gout is the most common category of gout and is usually related to the combination of naturally-occurring risk factors such as genetics and diet. Secondary gout is when a specific cause for the condition can be identified, such as the existence of a medical condition, or taking medications which increase the levels of uric acid in the bloodstream. 5 Q: Are gout and pseudogout the same? A: No. Although gout and pseudogout have some similar symptoms and treatments, they have entirely different causes and should be treated separately. Gout is caused by excess uric acid in the body, while pseudogout is caused by excess calcium pyrophosphate. This means the preventative measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of developing gout, such as a low-purine diet, are not applicable to pseudogout. 18 Q: Is there a link between diet and gout? A: Yes. Gout is caused by high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream. Uric acid is produced in the body when breaking down a chemical called purine, which is found in certain foods. 19 Examples of high purine foods are: Alcohol, especially beer Some fish, seafood and shellfish Some meats including organ meat and red meat A doctor may recommend changes to your diet to reduce the risk of gout attacks returning. However, while diet is a risk factor for gout, it is not the sole cause. A low-purine diet should not be considered a cure for gout and dietary alterations should always be discussed with a doctor."

    "condition": "Graves’ Disease",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/graves-disease/",
    "what_is_graves_disease": "Graves’ disease, also known as Basedow’s disease or diffuse toxic goiter, is an autoimmune condition in which a person’s immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excess amounts of thyroid hormone, causing hyperthyroidism and sometimes eye problems. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism . 1 The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the lower part of the neck, positioned below the voice box. Hormones released by the gland control the body’s metabolism, playing a key role in processes like digestion, temperature, heart rate and growth. If the levels of these hormones go too low or too high and are not corrected, a person can experience a range of unpleasant and potentially dangerous effects and complications. 1 2 Symptoms of Graves’ disease may include: 1 Nervousness Racing heart or palpitations, i.e. pronounced awareness of one’s heartbeat Difficulty sleeping Intolerance to heat Feeling tired and/or weak Swelling of the thyroid, i.e. development of a goiter Irritation and bulging of the eyes, known as Graves’ ophthalmopathy or thyroid eye disease\n\nTreatment for Graves’ disease depends on the particular person, but may include medication to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone being produced, radioiodine therapy and, in some cases, surgery to remove the thyroid gland. The condition may go into remission and then relapse. Treatment and monitoring is usually lifelong. ref1 ref2 ref23 With careful management by a doctor who specializes in hormonal conditions, an endocrinologist, the outlook is good and many people with Graves’ disease are able to enjoy a full, healthy life. ref6 ref8 However, untreated or poorly treated Graves’ disease can lead to serious complications, including an increased risk of bone fractures, cardiovascular disease and stroke, as well as thyroid storm. In the case of Graves’ eye disease, vision loss may occur. ref2 ref9 ref10 Diffuse toxic goiter can affect people of any age, though it tends to be more prevalent in adults, particularly those between the ages of 20 and 50, than children. It is more common in women than men and often runs in families, meaning that several family members may have the same condition. ref1 ref2 ref4 ref11 ref17 ref21",
    "graves_disease_symptoms": "A person with Graves’, or Basedow’s disease, may develop general signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism , including: 1 3 4 5 Anxiety or nervousness Irritability, agitation or restlessness Rapid or irregular heartbeat or palpitations Sleep disturbances, i.e. insomnia Increased sweating, body warmth and heat intolerance Fatigue and weakness Difficulty exercising Tremors, i.e. shaky hands Having more bowel movements than usual Unexplained weight loss or difficulty gaining weight; in some cases there may be weight gain due to increased appetite Hair loss Erectile dysfunction in men Symptoms may develop gradually, and may seem to come and go. In some people, there may be swelling of the thyroid gland, called a goiter. This may be noticeable as a bulge in the front of the neck. 1 2 6 Read more about symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nIn women, Graves’ disease may also cause menstrual irregularities including: 1 4 Very light periods Infrequent periods Absence of periods\n\nAn estimated 25 to 50 percent of people with Graves’ disease experience eye symptoms, sometimes without the other symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These eye symptoms are caused by a condition called Graves’ ophthalmopathy, Graves’ orbitopathy or thyroid eye disease; despite the name they can also occur in people without thyroid problems. Eye symptoms may include: 7 4 8 Irritation, tearing or dryness in the eyes; the eyes may feel gritty Redness of the eyes and eyelids Swelling of the upper eyelids Sensitivity to light Bulging of the eyes Pain in or behind the eyes, particularly when looking up or to the side In most cases, the eye symptoms of Graves’ disease are mild and easy to treat. However, in a small number of cases they can be very serious and damage a person’s vision. Some of the more severe symptoms of thyroid eye disease include: 7 4 8 Inability to move the eyes Ulcers on the cornea (the outer layer of the eye) Blurred or double vision Loss of vision and blindness (rare) If you are experiencing any eye problems and suspect that you may have thyroid eye disease, it is recommended that you see a doctor without delay.\n\nA small number of people with Graves’ disease develop red, thick, swollen areas of skin, typically on the shins and the top of the feet. This is called pretibial myxedema, thyroid dermopathy or Graves’ dermopathy, and is most often seen in people who also have eye symptoms . 1 9",
    "causes": "Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition, which means that it is caused by the body’s immune system mistakenly targeting healthy tissue, in this case the thyroid gland. Graves’ disease occurs when immune system proteins (antibodies), which normally attack bacteria and viruses, start attacking the thyroid gland. This causes the thyroid gland to secrete more thyroid hormone than is needed by the body, leading to hyperthyroidism. 10\n\nIt is not understood exactly what causes the immune system to target the thyroid gland, but hereditary factors are thought to be involved . Certain genes passed down in families seem to make a person more likely to develop Graves’ disease. If a relative has the condition, the risk is increased. It is thought that other risk factors for the development of the disease may include: 11 12 13 14 15 16 Being female Having been pregnant recently Having another autoimmune condition, e.g. type 1 diabetes , Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis Severe stress High iodine intake Smoking tobacco; this is also associated with worsening of Graves’ eye symptoms Certain medications, e.g. Interferon beta-1b Certain infections, e.g. Yersinia enterocolitica Injury to the thyroid gland, e.g. through surgery\n\nGraves’ ophthalmology is not the result of excess thyroid hormone in the body, but rather inflammation and swelling in the tissues behind the eyes. This swelling pushes the eyeballs forward, causing bulging and other symptoms. The same antibodies that mistakenly stimulate the thyroid gland to produce high levels of thyroid hormone mistakenly target these tissues in some people, though the exact reason for this is not clearly understood. 8 12 17 Smoking tobacco is a risk factor in the development and worsening of thyroid-associated eye disease. 8 17",
    "diagnosis": "The first step in the diagnosis of Graves’ disease is typically a visit to a doctor, who will take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. If Graves’ disease is suspected, doctors will usually order blood tests to check thyroid hormone levels, as well as levels of thyroid antibodies. An ultrasound scan of the thyroid gland and/or radioactive iodine uptake test may also be needed. These imaging tests can help the doctor to see whether any swelling or nodules, which are small lumps, are present. 1\n\nThese are able to measure levels of the following: 1 18 3 14 19 20 Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) : This varies according to how much thyroid hormone is needed by the body at any given time. TSH levels are usually very low in Graves’ disease and many other conditions that cause hyperthyroidism. Free thyroxine (FT4): This is a form of thyroid hormone that is converted into the biologically active T3. FT4 levels are usually high when Graves’ disease is present. Free triiodothyronine (FT3): Not always measured. However, FT3 levels are usually high when Graves’ disease is present. 1 21\n\nThyroid antibodies: Graves’ disease is typically characterized by high levels of thyroid antibodies, particularly thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), as well as thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR Ab), also known as TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs). High levels of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg) are often detected in people affected by Graves’ too.\n\nA non-invasive scan of the throat region, a thyroid ultrasound can help to identify nodules and swelling, thereby helping to identify the cause of the hyperthyroidism. 19\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may recommend a test in which the person is given a very small dose of a weakly radioactive substance and then undergoes a special imaging scan. Because the thyroid takes up iodine, this test can provide insights into how the thyroid is functioning and what the cause of the hyperthyroidism may be. It is generally safe for most people, but is not recommended for pregnant women. 1 19 22\n\nIt is important to distinguish signs and symptoms of Graves’ disease from other conditions that can sometimes present in similar ways, such as other thyroid problems , an anxiety disorder or bipolar disorder . Blood tests and the other tests detailed above help to ensure an accurate diagnosis. 23",
    "graves_disease_treatment": "Treatment for Graves’ disease is generally the same as treatment for hyperthyroidism . It typically requires lifelong monitoring and management of thyroid hormone levels, with the help of an endocrinologist and general practitioners, to ensure that they remain in the acceptable range. Depending on the particular person and their circumstances, treatment options may include: 1 3 Antithyroid medication; this is the term for medicine aimed at reducing thyroid function Radioiodine therapy Thyroid surgery Read more about hyperthyroidism treatment »\n\nIn many cases, Graves’ orbitopathy clears up on its own, without any specific treatment. However, in other cases treatment may be necessary. This may include: 7 In mild cases, cool compresses, lubricating eye drops and sunglasses Corticosteroid medication In severe cases, surgery A person with thyroid eye disease will be referred to a doctor specializing in the eyes, called an ophthalmologist, for management of the condition. 7 17\n\nThe skin lesions that some people with Graves’ disease develop do not generally cause discomfort and are not usually serious. However, they can be unsightly. Treatment for thyroid dermopathy is often not necessary, but where recommended typically involves the application of corticosteroid creams. People with more severe pretibial myxedema may find that wearing compression stockings is also helpful in providing relief. 24 25\n\nIf it is left untreated or medical advice is not adequately followed, Graves’ disease can cause serious complications. These include: 18 Eye damage and vision loss, in the case of thyroid eye disease 7 17 Hypothyroidism if thyroid hormone levels are not adequately monitored and managed 14 Thyroid storm Other complications Read more about thyroid storm and other complications of hyperthyroidism »",

    "graves_disease_faqs": "Q: Are Graves’ disease and hyperthyroidism the same thing? A: While the two terms are often used interchangeably, there is a difference. Hyperthyroidism refers to a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive and causes an excess of thyroid hormone in the body, resulting in a range of symptoms. Hyperthyroidism has a number of possible causes; Graves’ disease is the most common of these. Furthermore, a small number of people may have Graves’ disease without symptoms of hyperthyroidism, experiencing only eye problems because of the condition. 26 Q: Is Graves’ disease curable? A: While the underlying autoimmune condition cannot currently be cured, Graves’ disease can be effectively treated and managed with the help of a doctor and medical therapies. 1 Q: Is there a special Graves’ disease diet? A: Though some sources claim that various diets may help people with Graves’ disease, no specific diet is recommended by doctors. In general, a balanced and healthy diet is considered sufficient. It is not advisable for a person affected by Graves’ disease to adopt a special diet, stop eating foods they usually eat, or take any nutritional supplements without first consulting a doctor. However, iodine and kelp supplements in particular should be strictly avoided unless recommended by a licensed medical practitioner, as it is thought that they can worsen hyperthyroidism. 27 Q: Is there a natural treatment for Graves’ disease? A: There are currently no widely-recognized natural treatments for Graves’ disease. If you are concerned that you may have the condition, it is important to consult a doctor without delay. Without proper treatment, Graves’ disease can cause serious complications. Furthermore, taking supplements and natural products not specifically recommended by medical professionals can cause side-effects, and can be dangerous when combined with certain medications. 1 Q: Graves’ disease and pregnancy: what do I need to know? A: Graves’ disease can cause a number of serious complications for both the mother and baby if it is not adequately managed during pregnancy . Anyone who has been diagnosed with Graves’ disease or suspects that they may have the condition should consult a doctor when planning a pregnancy, if possible, or as soon as they know that they are pregnant. Q: Graves’ disease vs. Hashimoto’s: what is the difference? A: Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone than is needed, leading to hyperthyroidism . Hashimoto’s disease, also known as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, is also an autoimmune condition, but one in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, damaging the tissue and typically leading to hypothyroidism . Of the two thyroid disorders, Hashimoto’s is the more common."

    "what_is_hashimoto_disease": "Hashimoto disease is a condition of the thyroid . The thyroid is a small gland situated in the front of your neck that produces important hormones. These hormones produced by the thyroid are involved in many processes throughout the body, as they regulate how your body uses energy. Hashimoto disease is an autoimmune disorder , meaning that the immune system mistakenly attacks your own thyroid gland. This can cause the thyroid to slow down its production of hormones, which is a situation called hypothyroidism . Women are affected by Hashimoto disease much more frequently than men, with a ratio of about 9:1. In early disease stages, Hashimoto’s disease can sometimes also lead to a temporarily overactive thyroid, which is also referred to as hyperthyroidism . 1 2",

A physical exam of the neck can help your healthcare provider assess whether there is an enlargement of your thyroid gland. If your healthcare provider suspects that you may have Hashimoto’s disease, then blood tests testing for thyroid hormone levels and certain antibodies can help confirm Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis. 1 In some cases, the diagnosis of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis also requires an ultrasound . This is especially the case when your blood tests are inconclusive, but your healthcare provider still suspects that you may have Hashimoto. On an ultrasound of your thyroid gland, your healthcare provider can assess the size and characteristics of your thyroid. 3",
    "how_to_treat_hashimoto": "Hashimoto disease treatment depends on how far your condition has progressed. In the early stages, your healthcare provider may recommend you to wait for treatment and check your symptoms and thyroid hormone levels regularly. If your thyroid hormone levels have dropped due to damage caused by the condition, then your healthcare provider may recommend you Hashimoto disease medication. This medication, called levothyroxine , serves as a replacement for a thyroid hormone called thyroxine (T4) and helps to get your levels of thyroid hormones back within the normal range. In order to follow up on your hormone levels and to see whether the dosage of your medication is correct, your healthcare provider will need to check your blood regularly . 2 3 Diet is also an essential factor in Hashimoto's treatment. Excessive intake of foods that are high in iodine should be avoided, such as kelp and seaweed, commonly used in sushi. Your healthcare provider can give you recommendations on what to take into account for your Hashimoto’s thyroiditis diet. 1 Although Hashimoto’s thyroiditis medication is an effective treatment for Hashimoto, new treatments for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are constantly being researched and developed.",

As a result of their symptoms, people with hay fever can experience problems including: Trouble sleeping Problems remembering things Irritability Decreased concentration Increased risk of work-related injuries and vehicle accidents In addition to the symptoms listed above, people who suffer from both asthma and allergicrhinitis are likely to experience asthmatic symptoms during an attack of hay fever. Mostcommonly these include a tight feeling in the chest, wheezing and shortness of breath. If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by hay fever, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .",
    "causes": "Sufferers of hay fever commonly experience symptoms during the summer months when the pollen count is at its highest. To reduce the negative impact of hay fever, it is necessary to identify the specific allergens which trigger the symptoms. Particular plants which are known to cause hay fever symptoms on a widespread scale include: 2 Airborne mold (summer and autumn) Grass pollen (spring and summer) Pollen from trees (spring and summer) Weed pollen  (spring, summer and autumn)",
    "diagnosis": "To diagnose hay fever, a doctor will assess the symptoms. Diagnostic tests which may be carried out include an intradermal test and/or a prick and scratch test. These tests involve giving the affected person small amounts of specific allergens to see if an allergic reaction takes place.\n\nAn intradermal test is the most accurate way to determine whether a person is sufferingfrom hay fever. Possible allergens (such as grass and weed pollen) are injected under theskin. After 20 minutes, the site is monitored for an allergic reaction, which usuallyinvolves the reddening of the skin and an itching sensation.\n\nThe prick or scratch test the most common type of skin test. It involves pricking or scratchingthe skin before exposure to an allergen-containing solution. The results are known within10 to 20 minutes.\n\nIn certain cases; for example, if there is a medical reason why intradermal or prick or scrach testing cannot be carried out, a blood test may be used to confirm the diagnosis of hay fever. A blood test for hay fever is also known as an antibody test. It involves sending a sample of the affected person's blood to a laboratory, where it will be analysed for the presence of antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE). These are protiens which are produced by the immune system during an allergic reaction to pollen. In people who are having an allergic response to pollen, levels of IgE in the blood will be significantly higher than in those who are not, leading to a diagnosis of hay fever.

    "treatment": "A treatment plan for hay fever typically involves following precautions to avoid hay fevertriggers and taking medication as needed to manage the symptoms. For many people, one ormore short-term medications can be sufficient to manage the symptoms of hay fever. Forothers, immunotherapy is a possible treatment option that can provide long-term relief.\n\nFor many people affected by hay fever, short-term medications effectively treat the symptomsof hay fever on a temporary basis. Alleviating the symptoms when they flare up is usuallysufficient for someone with hay fever to maintain a normal quality of life. Antihistamines relieve the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching, skinirritation and watery eyes. They can be administered as needed as nasal spray, tablets oreye drops. Nasal corticosteroid medications are very effective at reducing the symptomscaused by allergies. Used over time, they can help to desensitise the nasal passageway tothe allergens which cause hay fever. 3\n\nIf antihistamines and nasal corticosteroid medications do not enable a person to manage theirhay fever symptoms effectively, the doctor will prescribe a course of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a long-term treatment option which serves to alter the body’s autoimmune response to allergens. When it is used to treat hay fever, a course of immunotherapy typically begins about three months before exposure to hay fever triggers is likely to occur and involves either a series of injections or the administration of sublingual allergy tablets. Treatment with sublingual immunotherapy involves daily administration of the allergens, ina liquid or tablet which is placed under the tongue. Treatment with injections is dividedinto two stages. In the first stage, a person will be injected at intervals over a period of several weeks with increasingly concentrated doses of the allergen. During the second phase, they will receive monthly top-up injections of the the allergen at a uniform dose.",
    "prevention": "Whilst it is not always possible to avoid pollen and other allergens completely, it ispossible to take precautions against hay fever. Making changes to one's daily routine andenvironment can reduce a person's exposure to airborne pollen. To prevent pollen exposure as one goes about one's day is advisable to stay indoors as much as possible. Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day can help to prevent allergic reactions. It is also advisable to avoid using tobacco products, particularly smoking, which can aggravate the symptoms of hay fever by irritating the airways. Breathing moist air (from hot water) can also help to alleviate the congestion associated with hay fever. To exclude pollen from the home environment, keeping the windows and doors shut is reccomended. It is also advisible to change into freshly washed clothes when you reenter the house and  cleaning any domestic air vents and installing a pollen filter in your car can also help reduce contact with allergens. When one is outside, it is helpful to avoid cut grass and fresh flowers.",
    "hay_fever_faqs": "Q: Does antihistamine cause tiredness? A: Many systemic antihistamines cause drowsiness as a side-effect. Doctors oftenadvise taking varieties of antihistamine which cause tiredness at night time. When sourcingmedication for hay fever, it is important to find out whether tiredness is one of its sideeffects, as this will make it unsafe to drive or operate heavy machinery. Q: Is there a cure for hay fever? A: There is no absolute cure for allergic rhinitis, but the right treatment plan canreduce symptoms significantly and enable a normal quality of life. Immunotherapy/hyposensitizationtherapy can achieve long-term pollen desensitization to specific triggers. Q: Can hay fever be mistaken for other conditions? A: Hay fever shares many symptoms with the common cold. If you have been sufferingfrom cold-like symptoms including nasal congestion and sneezing for over two weeks, it isadvisable to seek a medical opinion as you may be suffering from hay fever.

    "what_is_a_headache": "Headaches are characterized by pain in any part of the head. They are second only to the common cold as the most frequently-heard medical complaint and manifest in many different forms – all with their own causes, triggers and characteristics. 1 A headache can be localized to one part of the head or affect the whole head; the pain can also vary in sensation, severity and frequency. 2 A range of treatment options are available for headaches, with the chosen method dependent on the type of headache and its causes. In most instances, headaches can be managed effectively through medication, lifestyle changes or a combination of the two.",
    "types": "There are many different types of headaches – some estimate as many as 150 – with differing causes, triggers, and symptoms. 3 However, all can be sorted into two overarching categories : primary and secondary. 4 Primary headaches are headaches that are due to the headache condition itself and not to any other cause. Secondary headaches are headaches that are symptomatic of another condition, e.g. a sinus headache from sinusitis . The most common types of headache include: Tension headache Migraines Cluster headache Sinus headache Hormonal headache Caffeine-triggered headache Hypertension headache Hangover headache Exertion headache Tumor headache Post-traumatic headache Chronic, progressive headache Medication-overuse headache\n\nLet's understand the causes and symptoms of the 13 most common types of headache :\n\nTension headaches, or stress headaches, are the most common type of headache in adults. They are classified as a primary headache, as they are not a symptom of another condition or injury. The principal trigger of tension headaches is thought to be stress, either a single stressful situation or a buildup of stress over a long period of time. Additional triggers may include lack of sleep, weather changes, excessive muscular tension, especially in the neck and shoulder area, and, in some people, the after effects of drinking alcohol. 5 6 The sensation associated with a tension headache is often described as a dull pain or pressure around the head, usually on both sides, or the neck. Although they can be considerably painful, in most cases, the pain of a tension headache is mild to moderate and will not affect an individual’s ability to work or carry out daily tasks. If tension headaches occur under 15 times per month, they are classified as episodic tension headaches, whereas if they occur 15 times or more per month they are classified as chronic tension headaches. Both can last anywhere from around 30 minutes to a number of days, though chronic headaches will generally last longer. Pain medication such as aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen and naproxen can be effective in treating a tension headache. 7 Taking measures to reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, therapy or using breathing techniques, can also be effective in preventing the onset of a tension headache, but are most effective when practiced on a regular basis. If tension headaches are frequent and continuously treated with analgesics, there is a chance that the headaches may become chronic. This may be due to medicine-overuse syndrome, otherwise known as analgesic rebound, in which medication ceases to provide relief and may actually contribute to the headaches themselves. Read more about Tension Headaches »\n\nMedication-overuse headaches are headaches caused by taking of painkillers or triptan medications typically used to treat headaches and migraines. Although named an overuse headache, in most cases, these headaches will occur as a result of taking the medication in the correct quantity, as prescribed by the doctor. Once identified, the treatment method is to stop the consumption of the medication and for an alternative to be found.\n\nMigraines are powerful primary headaches which are often accompanied by severe pain and throbbing, nausea, light sensitivity, hypersensitivity to sounds and vomiting. 8 In 60 percent of cases, a migraine is  limited to one side of the head, and can be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, certain foods (including alcohol, cheese and certain additives), caffeine, changes in the weather and tiredness, among other factors. They can also have a significant hereditary component, with the approximate calculation that, if both parents suffer from migraines, a child has a 75 percent chance of inheriting the condition. A migraine can last anywhere from a few hours to a number of days. Pain relievers such as triptans, ergotamine, aspirin and ibuprofen are the usual drugs prescribed to individuals experiencing migraines. In extreme cases, when migraines are frequent and intensely painful, preventative medication may be prescribed. These can include drugs like beta blockers (e.g. propanolol), antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline, and certain anti-seizure drugs (e.g. topiramate). 9 Read more about Migraines »\n\nCluster headaches are a type of primary headache without a known cause. 10 Cluster headaches occur as a series of relatively short but severely painful headaches, often during the night.  They will generally occur every day for a number of weeks or months at a time. In most cases, cluster headaches will happen at the same time each year. However, some people will go for long periods without experiencing headaches; 2 years is the average length of remission, but this can be anywhere between 2 months and 20 years. The pain associated with cluster headaches is often described as a powerful burning or throbbing sensation, which is usually limited to one side of the head, as well as behind or around one eye. Pain will usually also be accompanied by the secretion of tears, a red eye, nasal stuffiness, a swollen eyelid, a drooping eyelid, constriction of the pupil, and/or sweating from the face and forehead, all limited to the same side of the head as the headache. A cluster headache will tend to last for a short period of time – roughly 30 to 90 minutes – most often one to three times per day over a number of weeks or months. Ordinary pain relievers such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and opioids tend to be ineffective against this type of headache. To treat an acute cluster headache, the inhalation of oxygen or lidocaine nasal drops are two of the preferred methods. Read more about Cluster Headaches »\n\nThe sinuses are hollow cavities in the cheekbones, behind the forehead and in the nose. When they become inflamed, most commonly as a consequence of an infection or an allergic reaction, the pressure that builds up can result in headache-like pain, termed as sinus headaches. 11 The pain of a sinus headache can be constant, range from mild pressure to severe pain, and is sometimes accompanied by a fever, runny nose and swelling of the face as signs that the sinuses are inflamed. Decongestants are the prefered method of treatment. Antibiotics may also be prescribed in cases where headaches are being caused by bacterial sinusitis .\n\nFluctuating levels of the hormone estrogen during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause, as well as a result of certain contraceptives (contraceptive pills, for example) and hormone replacement therapy, can lead to acute or chronic headaches in women. When particularly severe, these headaches are described as menstrual migraines and may be accompanied by some of the other symptoms of a migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. 12 Pain relievers and triptans can be effective in treating hormone headaches. 13\n\nCaffeine headaches are typically a symptom of caffeine withdrawal or sensitivity. Those who consume caffeine sporadically or who consume a large amount of caffeine within a short amount of time, are typically more at risk of caffeine headaches. 14 A caffeine headache can be painful – normally beginning behind the eyes and progressing into the forehead area. In severe cases, a caffeine headache can develop into a migraine. Treating a caffeine headache may involve the use of over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers, drinking plenty of fluids or avoiding caffeine completely.\n\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, can cause headache in some cases. These headache typically occur in the morning and are located in the back of the head. Malignant hypertension, a condition in which the body’s blood pressure reaches critical levels, can lead to a buildup of pressure in the cranium, which in turn can also trigger head pain or a migraine. This may be accompanied by nausea, chest pain and blurred vision. Those experiencing malignant hypertension should seek medical treatment immediately. 15 Treating hypertension headaches will invariably involve treating the underlying cause: high blood pressure. However, for immediate relief, pain relievers may be effective. Read more about Hypertension »\n\nHangover headaches, or alcohol-induced headaches, are a common form of headache that typically manifests the day after excessive consumption of alcohol. The pain will, in most cases, be felt on both sides of the head, be throbbing or pulsating in sensation and worsen with physical activity. Alcohol can also act as a trigger for migraines. 16 A hangover headache can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications and rehydration, as in drinking plenty of water over the day. Read more about a hangover »\n\nExertion headaches – or activity-related headaches – are typically triggered by lengthy periods of physical exercise and are most common in younger people under 50. 17 The headache will usually develop as the exercise reaches its peak, and fade when the exertion stops. However, in rare cases, the headache can last significantly longer. An exertion headache can be painful and may be accompanied by symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. Anti-inflammatory drugs can be effective in treating an exertion headache. In rare cases, this type of headache can be a sign of a more serious condition, including aneurysm and brain tumors, so professional medical advice should be sought if the problem persists. 18\n\nHeadaches are one of the most common symptoms of a brain tumor. Tumor headaches are typically characterized by their persistence, yet may still fade after a number of hours or days, and may be accompanied by vomiting. Moreover, tumor headaches are unlikely to respond to traditional treatment methods. Individuals experiencing headaches, who suspect the presence of a tumor, should seek medical advice promptly. 19 Tumor headaches may be managed through medications prescribed by doctors and surgery.\n\nChronic progressive headaches – also known as traction or inflammatory headaches – are a rare headache type, which can in some cases be a sign of more serious conditions such as brain tumors, strokes and head trauma. They typically worsen and occur more frequently over time. It may be necessary for tests such as an MRI scan, CT scan or eye exam to be performed in order to diagnose chronic progressive headaches. 20 It is always advisable to visit a doctor promptly if headaches recur or worsen over time, so that any underlying condition can be diagnosed and treated.\n\nA post-traumatic, or post-concussion , headache is described as a headache that develops within seven days of head trauma or regaining consciousness following a head trauma. 21 The severity of a post-traumatic headache can vary, however, these headaches are often more intense in nature, like migraines, and may be accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and light sensitivity, as well as further symptoms like dizziness, insomnia, and memory problems. It is important to seek medical attention for any head trauma. Headaches should fade and desist as a result of treatment for the head trauma itself, though pain medications and anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can be used in the short term to alleviate pain. These should only be used if prescribed by the doctor who performed the examination after the head trauma/injury.",
    "types_2": "In some cases, it may be possible to identify a particular type of headache based on which part of the head is affected. The following is a breakdown of headache types based on location . It should be noted that some types of headaches can affect multiple locations. Moreover, some types of headaches, such as post-traumatic headaches or tumor headaches are generalized, meaning they affect the whole of the head. Frontal (front of the head): tension headache, migraine, sinus headache, caffeine-triggered headache, hangover headache, hypertension headache Temporal (side of the head): tension headache, hangover headache Occipital (back of the head): tension headache, hypertension headache Middle or top of the head: tension headache One side of the head: migraine, cluster headache Behind or around the eyes: cluster headache, caffeine-triggered headache",
    "diagnosing_headaches": "In order to receive appropriate treatment, it is important to describe the nature of a headache to the doctor fully, making sure to include information such as: 22 How long a person has been experiencing headaches Age of onset How often the headaches occur Suspected triggers for the headaches (foods, medication, etc.) If any family members experience similar headaches The location and severity of the pain How long the headaches last Whether there are any other symptoms that occur besides the headaches Following the investigation of a person’s medical history, a doctor will typically perform a comprehensive physical and neurological exam in order to identify any underlying conditions that may be causing the headaches. This will involve testing for conditions such as high blood pressure, infection, brain tumors and head trauma. If no underlying condition can be found, the diagnosis will likely conclude that an individual is suffering from a primary headache type (tension, cluster or a migraine). In rare cases, further tests may be called for. The decision to have someone undergo these tests is the responsibility of the doctor and will depend on their analysis of an individual’s medical history, symptoms and initial test results. These tests may include a CT scan, MRI scan, blood tests , urinalysis or sinus X-ray (sinus series). To help doctors and the affected person themselves to further understand the headaches and track any changes over time, it may also be useful to keep a headache diary. The diary should note the time, duration and severity of the headaches, as well as any accompanying symptoms. If you are experiencing headaches, try using the free Ada app to find out what the problem is.",
    "preventing_headaches": "Headache triggers such as hormone fluctuation and the weather cannot be controlled, however, once identified, other triggers can be managed to help prevent the risk of headaches. The most common triggers to avoid include: 23 Stress : Learn and apply a relaxation technique or meditate on a regular basis. Dehydration: Drink adequate amounts of non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated beverages. Foods: Maintain a nutritionally sound, balanced diet. Environment: Whenever possible, spend time in calming environments with fresh air. Bright lights and loud noises can trigger headaches in some people. By taking steps to avoid triggers, headaches may be prevented or their frequency at least reduced.",
    "when_to_see_a_doctor": "In most cases, a headache need not be a serious concern. However, as they can sometimes be indicators of more serious conditions, individuals experiencing regular or semi-regular headaches should keep track of their symptoms and seek medical attention, if they notice any of the following symptoms: 24 Fatigue, dizziness, numbness, tingling, sudden loss of balance, immobility Seizures, trouble with speech, confusion, changes in disposition Blurred vision, double vision, blind spots Fever, rashes, neck-stiffness, shortness of breath Nausea, vomiting If none of these symptoms are present, but headaches or migraines become more frequent or gradually worsen, medical attention is advised, nevertheless.",
    "headache_faq": "Q: Are there any home remedies for headaches? A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for headaches. Two of the most regularly cited include: 25 Thyme, peppermint and rosemary oil: Rub a small amount of thyme, peppermint, or rosemary oil onto the temples. After a short period, a headache should begin to lessen in intensity. These oils contain a natural anti-inflammatory agent. Ginger: Ginger is thought to be effective against migraines and especially against the nausea they are often accompanied by. Make tea using fresh ginger for the best results. If headaches persist, professional medical attention should always be sought. Q: What is the difference between a migraine and a headache? A: A migraine is one of many types of headaches. However, it is important to differentiate between a migraine and any other type of headache, as this will allow the sufferer to seek appropriate treatment  more quickly. The level and type of pain being experienced is the main way to tell the difference. The pain associated with a migraine will typically be severe, throbbing and, in 60 percent of cases, affect just one side of the head. A migraine may also be accompanied by nausea, pain in one eye or ear and pain in the temples, among other symptoms. A tension headache, another common type of headache, on the other hand, will typically involve less intense pain (though can be severe) and will generally affect both sides of the head. A doctor’s opinion should always be sought when a new type of headache occurs. A doctor will be able to differentiate between a migraine and other types of headache and recommend appropriate treatment options."

    "condition": "Hemophilia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/hemophilia/",
    "what_is_hemophilia": "Hemophilia is a hereditary genetic bleeding disorder that causes blood clotting problems due to a lack of the proteins needed for normal blood clotting to take place. This causes people with hemophilia to bleed more than other people, for example, after injuries or surgeries. This condition is passed on the X chromosome, and for this reason, it affects males more commonly than females . Diagnosis is made based on the symptoms, whether a family member is known to have hemophilia, and by testing the clotting function of the blood. Preventing injuries and taking extra clotting proteins are two ways to prevent the complications of this condition. With good management, the outlook for people with hemophilia is good, although it depends on the severity of the clotting factor deficiency.",
    "what_causes_hemophilia": "Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder caused by a mutation in a gene . The blood clotting problems occur because people with hemophilia have a lack of the proteins needed for normal blood clotting to take place . There are two types of hemophilia: type A (the more severe and common type) type B (also known as Christmas disease). In mild hemophilia, a person’s blood has some ability to clot, but in people with the severe type, the blood may have very few or no clotting proteins at all. Because it is a genetic disorder, hemophilia tends to run in families; however, around one-third of people diagnosed are the first person in their family to have hemophilia. These people can pass the gene to their children. This gene is on the X chromosome, and therefore, because they only have one, males are more likely to have hemophilia than females.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "People with hemophilia tend to bruise or bleed excessively after small incidents or procedures . They may have a tendency to bruise or to have severe episodes of nose bleeding, gum bleeding, or even bleeding into joints. Women with hemophilia may have heavy periods. People with hemophilia are also at increased risk of bleeding in the bowel, which may cause red or black bowel movements.",
    "how_is_hemophilia_diagnosed": "The diagnosis is based on the symptoms of the affected person, whether any other people in the family are known to have hemophilia, physical examination and tests for the ability of the blood to clot. Blood tests may reveal that the blood takes longer than usual to clot, and low levels or an absence of some of the proteins needed for normal blood clotting.",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_hemophilia": "Treatment of hemophilia depends on the ability of the blood to clot . People whose blood has some ability to clot may receive an injection to improve blood clotting before they have a procedure, which may cause bleeding, such as dental work. People whose blood has little or no ability to clot alone may need to have regular injections to protect them in case of accidents. Treatment should be carried out by an expert in the field. People with hemophilia should wear a medical alert bracelet or carry an ID card with them in case of emergencies.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/hemorrhagic-stroke/",
    "what_is_hemorrhagic_stroke": "A stroke occurs when the normal flow of blood to the brain is interrupted, causing it to be starved of oxygen. If this is caused by a blood vessel bursting in or around the brain, it is known as a hemorrhagic stroke. A stroke is an emergency, and medical attention must be sought immediately. About one in five strokes are hemorrhagic. 1 An acronym, FAST, explains the telltale signs that a stroke is taking place : 2 3 Face: The face becomes weak or droopy, with the effect usually more visible on one side Arm: One arm becomes numb or weak, and there may be difficulty raising it Speech: Speaking becomes difficult, and the affected person’s voice becomes slurred Time to call: If any of the above is noticed, the emergency services should be called immediately The severity of the symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke depends on what parts of the brain are affected. There are two types of hemorrhagic stroke: 1 2 An intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is when a blood vessel within the brain ruptures. The main cause of ICHs is high blood pressure. About one in 10 strokes is an ICH. [ A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), ] which is bleeding between the layers of tissue that surround the brain. About one in 20 strokes is an SAH. For more detailed information, see this resource on subarachnoid hemorrhage. A hemorrhagic stroke is most often diagnosed through a brain scan, such as a CT scan. Medical treatment in a hospital and close medical supervision is required to guarantee the best possible outcome after a hemorrhagic stroke takes place. Surgery to stop the bleeding or address complications could be necessary. Rehabilitation will very often be useful in dealing with the symptoms that may develop from a hemorrhagic stroke.",
    "hemorrhagic_stroke_signs_and_symptoms": "The specific symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke vary slightly between intracerebral hemorrhage strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhage strokes. This is because different parts of the brain are usually affected. Sudden weakness, a loss of bodily control and confusion are common to both types of hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nThe symptoms of an ICH usually appear suddenly. They include: 3 4 Numbness or weakness in the face, arm or leg Confusion and loss of the ability to speak Difficulty seeing or other visual problems due to eye movement difficulties A loss of balance and difficulty walking Vomiting Unusual breathing patterns A loss of consciousness and, potentially, a comatose state\n\nThe most common symptom is a sudden, explosive headache, called a thunderclap headache, which is often described as the worst headache ever, or as if there had been a blow to the head. It may last only a few seconds or even a fraction of a second. 2 Read more about subarachnoid hemorrhage symptoms »",
    "hemorrhagic_stroke_causes": "There are two main types of stroke: hemorrhagic and ischemic , both damaging the brain and therefore very severe conditions. In hemorrhagic stroke, which is the less common of the two, the damage is caused by bleeding in or around the brain.  The resulting collection of blood coming out of the bleed begins to put pressure upon and damage the brain tissue surrounding the bleeding site. This initial injury can lead to further swelling and inflammation within the brain, putting it under more pressure. Although a big part of the brain injury from a hemorrhagic stroke occurs because of the initial bleed, continued bleeding and the later swelling can lead to even more complications. That is why it is still so important to get a stroke treated as quickly as possible. 5 6\n\nAn ICH stroke occurs when a blood vessel bursts within the brain , causing blood to spill out and damage the area directly affected and, often, surrounding areas. The most common cause of an ICH in adults is hypertension , also known as high blood pressure. This puts extra strain on the blood vessels in your body, including the ones in the brain, making them more likely to burst and bleed. High blood pressure often shows no specific symptoms, unless it is suddenly rising and/or very severe; this means that many people affected by high blood pressure will not be aware that they have it. 2 This is partly why the symptoms of an ICH can come on without warning and seem so sudden, and why it is also important to get regular medical check-ups that include the reading of a person’s blood pressure. Read more about Essential Hypertension » Much rarer reasons for intracerebral hemorrhage include head trauma and tangles of abnormally formed blood vessels, known as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).\n\nSubarachnoid bleeding is commonly due to rupture of an aneurysm within the brain, an aneurysm being the swelling and bulging of an area in a blood vessel that forms, for example, due to a weak spot in an artery wall. The cause of an aneurysm may sometimes be unclear or caused by many individual, interacting factors. A possible reason for an aneurysm to develop may be a pre-existing condition that also leads to weaker blood vessel walls, such as  Marfan syndrome or a type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 7 There are various other causes of aneurysms, among them: 2 High blood pressure The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries Injuries to the head and brain, Some infections being among the more common ones Read more about subarachnoid hemorrhage causes »\n\nThe risk of having a hemorrhagic stroke strongly increases with age, but the condition can affect younger people too. The most common risk factor for any kind of stroke is high blood pressure : nearly three quarters of those affected by a sudden stroke have high blood pressure. 8 Avoidable risk factors common to hypertension and therefore both types of hemorrhagic stroke include: 1 2 Smoking tobacco products High alcohol use An unhealthy diet A lack of exercise The use of stimulant drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines and crystal meth Other factors, which are also linked to hemorrhagic stroke include: 4 9 Certain inherited conditions that weaken the blood vessels, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) Vasculitis, when blood vessels inside the brain become swollen and inflamed, due to infection or to conditions affecting the immune system Brain infection, such as encephalitis Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) Head and neck trauma When the ability to form blood clots is impaired, either due to certain medications or a bleeding disorder Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a buildup of proteins on the walls of the arteries in the brain Brain tumours",
    "diagnosis": "If a stroke is suspected, then medical attention should be sought immediately. Diagnosis and treatment will usually take place in a hospital emergency room. The first stage of diagnosis will generally involve a review of the affected person’s medical history and a physical exam. This will be followed by several tests to confirm whether the person is affected by a stroke and, if so, what type of stroke it is.\n\nA brain scan can help determine: 1 Whether the stroke is hemorrhagic or ischemic Where the bleeding is taking place The amount of bleeding The damage that has been caused to the brain thus far It can also help detect any potential brain abnormalities that may have contributed to or caused the stroke. Given the risk of ongoing damage from an untreated stroke, a brain scan must be carried out promptly after the affected person reaches a hospital.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. An MRI scan usually provides a more detailed picture than a CT scan, so could be beneficial if the injury is very small or might give slightly clearer results, depending on when it is run and the time that has passed since the stroke happened/symptoms started. 10\n\nIf a doctor wishes to get a more detailed view of the blood vessels in the body, they may insert a small amount of dye into the blood before performing a brain scan. In a computed tomography angiogram (CTA scan) or a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA), the dye is usually injected through an intravenous drip in the arm. It can also be injected into a vein on the back of the hand or by inserting a thin tube, known as catheter, through another blood vessel. Good to know: Less commonly, a lumbar puncture may be made by a doctor if a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is suspected and a CT or MRI scan fails to confirm this diagnosis. This involves taking a sample of fluid from around the spinal cord and investigating it for signs of blood. Read more about subarachnoid hemorrhage diagnosis » .",
    "hemorrhagic_stroke_treatment": "Treatment will generally focus on stabilising the person affected, reducing the level of pressure on the brain and, overall, stopping or minimising any brain damage. If there is a large amount of bleeding or a clot has formed in the brain, then surgery may be required. High blood pressure will usually be reduced gradually, if this is discovered to be a factor. 1\n\nSome medications are given in the short-term to minimise the risk of complications. These may include: 4 Blood pressure medication to prevent rebleeding Anticonvulsants , medication against seizures Certain diuretics to decrease the pressure in the subarachnoid space inside the head Treatment may be needed to reverse the effect of any blood-thinning medications, also known as anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin\n\nAfter a hemorrhagic stroke, treatment may be needed to reverse the effect of any priorly taken blood-thinning medications, also known as anticoagulants. These can include: 11 12 Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma for reversing the effects of warfarin Protamine for reversing the effects of heparin Idarucizumab for reversing the effects of dabigatran\n\nThere are several scenarios in which surgery may be suggested to treat a hemorrhagic stroke. This may be to deal with complications caused by the bleeding, to stop the bleeding or to minimise the risk of the bleeding beginning again. Most hemorrhagic stroke surgery takes place in a special neurosurgical unit. 1 3\n\nThere is the risk during a hemorrhagic stroke that a blood clot may form in the brain. The resulting increase of pressure on the brain could lead to a number of potentially permanent health complications if not addressed in a timely fashion. One potential way of surgically correcting this is through first performing a craniotomy , a procedure in which doctors open up a small part of the affected person’s skull, followed by steps to remove the blood clot.There are several considerations that go into whether a person should have a craniotomy, including physical health, age and likelihood of recovery. If the hemorrhage is deep in the brain, such as in the basal ganglia or internal capsule regions, then surgery is usually not recommended. Good to know: There are several surgical treatments that are specific to treating subarachnoid hemorrhages caused by burst aneurysms. These treatments are usually directed at sealing the aneurysm and stopping the bleeding. Read more about subarachnoid hemorrhage treatments »",
    "difficulties_after_hemorrhagic_stroke": "A person’s physical abilities are often restricted immediately after a stroke. The amount to which the person is affected varies from a feeling of numbness or weakness in parts of the body to a complete loss of power. Other commonly reported difficulties include difficulty swallowing and a loss of balance. This can lead to various problems, most of which can be managed by good nursing care, including: Deep vein thrombosis, dangerous blood clots which are more likely to form if the person is not moving around for long periods Unhealthy nutrition, because of difficulty swallowing or chewing Aspiration pneumonia, a type of pneumonia caused by food or drinks being accidentally inhaled into the lungs Falls and other accidents related to a sudden loss of balance and/or physical weakness Physical rehabilitation will usually begin in the hospital to improve muscular function and is often continued in an inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation center after hospital discharge .\n\nThis is when a person experiences problems with one or more brain functions. Cognitive dysfunction affects most people who have experienced a hemorrhagic stroke to some degree. Some common problems related to thinking include: 2 Memory problems, such as problems remembering names or faces, or making and keeping new memories. Difficulty concentrating for longer periods of time, often on previously straightforward tasks, such as making a cup of tea, and being easily distracted. Difficulty solving more complex tasks. This is due to increased tiredness, difficulty concentrating and other complex effects of the stroke. Some examples include: Tasks at work that require more thinking than routine behaviour Repairing broken objects in a logical order Solving crossword puzzles\n\nSome people may find that their speech becomes slurred or slowed, or that they have difficulty finding the right words to express themselves. This usually improves gradually. A speech and language therapist can often help by giving specific advice on management of significant speech difficulties and by providing individualized treatment to help a person as much as possible in dealing with speech or language problems.\n\nAfter a stroke, many people experience emotional problems, feel fearful of living with future complications or long-term disability, and may feel a loss of confidence in accomplishing everyday tasks or social activities. These problems may include: 13 14 15 Low, depressed mood and mood swings Clinical depression Crying or laughing easily, sometimes with no apparent reason or in socially inappropriate situations Feeling angry a lot more than previously The feeling that the person’s personality has changed Developing generalised anxiety disorder Developing post traumatic stress disorder Denial about the consequences of the stroke Emotional difficulties tend to improve with time and treatment, and there are various treatment options available to help and support someone experiencing them, including: Support groups such as those the registered with the National Stroke Association Talking therapies, such as psychotherapy Medications, such as antidepressants",
    "hemorrhagic_stroke_complications": "There are several serious complications that can occur after a hemorrhagic stroke. Those caring for the person affected by the stroke, as well as the person themselves, if they are able, need to be attentive and watch for any signs of these potential problems. Complications following a hemorrhagic stroke can increase the risk of long-term effects on a person’s health  or may even lead to an increased risk of death and should therefore be treated as quickly as possible.\n\nAfter a hemorrhagic stroke, there is some risk of the bleeding beginning once again. This is known as rebleeding and is most likely to occur in the few days after a stroke.\n\nSeizures  may develop after a hemorrhagic stroke, usually starting within the first year after the hemorrhage. Symptoms of seizures usually last up to a few minutes per bout and commonly include: 16 Loss of consciousness Muscle twitching and jerking Becoming stiff Medications are available to treat and prevent seizures as much as possible, and some doctors may prescribe or recommend anti-seizure medication, even if a seizure is yet to occur. For more on epilepsy, see this resource on generalized seizure .\n\nHemorrhagic stroke can possibly lead lead to disruption of the production and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which can lead to a buildup of fluid on the brain, known as hydrocephalus. This increases pressure on the brain, which can lead to (further) brain damage. Hydrocephalus is more likely to occur after subarachnoid hemorrhage than after intracranial bleeding. 17 Another complication that is more likely after an SAH than an ICH is vasospasm, which may lead to delayed cerebral ischemia. 4 9 18 A vasospasm occurs when a blood vessel goes into spasm, causing the vessel to narrow, and the blood supply to some parts of the brain to become dangerously low. Delayed cerebral ischemia is an umbrella term referring to one of the following after an SAH: ref25 New problems in brain function or a deterioration in consciousness lasting over an hour The discovery of new obstructions of the blood supply to the brain (infarctions) Read more about subarachnoid hemorrhage complications »",
    "hemorrhagic_stroke_faqs": "Q: Are there any hemorrhagic stroke recovery stories? A: Yes. While rehabilitation and recovery after a stroke are difficult, there are numerous cases of people recovering the majority of their motor and cognitive functions after one has taken place. Support groups, such as those the registered with the National Stroke Association , often offer opportunities to meet other stroke survivors. Healthtalk.org includes a number of recovery stories by people of all ages. Q: What is the prognosis for hemorrhagic stroke? A: Following a hemorrhagic stroke, long-term disability or a person not surviving the stroke are a serious risk. A medical professional will be able to give guidance and support regarding a person’s long-term prognosis, but it is often hard to predict the outcome accurately, and, in the end, people may fare worse or much better than previously estimated. Q: What is the difference between a hemorrhagic stroke and an ischemic stroke ? A: If a stroke does not feature bleeding, it is known as an ischemic stroke. This occurs most often when a blood vessel is blocked by a blood clot or a fatty deposit. In some cases, an ischemic stroke can turn into a hemorrhagic stroke. 19"

    "what_are_hemorrhoids": "Hemorrhoids, also known as piles, are swellings that occur when the blood vessels in and around the lower rectum and anal canal become enlarged or swollen. This may cause itching, bleeding and discomfort, though in some cases, no symptoms at all may be present. Hemorrhoids are very common and typically cause no serious health problems. They can, however, be uncomfortable and irritating, meaning medical attention is advised. Treatment options are available and are usually successful in managing the symptoms.",
    "grading_and_symptoms": "Hemorrhoids are categorized into four distinct grades. Symptoms vary according to which grade is being experienced: 2 Grade 1: Swellings are small and located at the beginning of the the anal canal where they cannot be seen or felt. This is the most common type of hemorrhoids. Grade 2: Swellings are larger and may be pushed out of the anus when using the bathroom or after abdominal pressing of another kind, such as sneezing or coughing. Grade 3: Swellings hang out of the anus when using the bathroom or during abdominal pressure of another kind, such as sneezing, but can be pushed back inside. Grade 4: Swellings hang out of the anus and cannot be pushed back inside. In some cases, no symptoms occur, and a person might not even realize they are experiencing the condition. In other cases, symptoms may include: 3 Rectal bleeding, usually painless, after defecating Itching or pain in and around the anus Difficulty cleaning the anus after defecating The feeling of a wet anus or leaking feces.\n\nIn the majority of cases, hemorrhoids are non-serious and, in grade one hemorrhoids, the symptoms may clear up without treatment. However, if the symptoms are persistent or severe, medical attention should be sought. This is particularly necessary if an individual experiences rectal bleeding, as this could be a result of a variety of other more serious conditions.",
    "causes": "The exact cause of hemorrhoids is unknown, and some people seem to experience the condition for no apparent reason. However, hemorrhoids are thought to be a result of increased pressure in the abdomen, rectum and/or the anal canal, causing engorgement of the blood vessels in the anal canal. This could be caused by factors such as periods of prolonged constipation , chronic diarrhea and/or a lack of fibre in one’s diet. Other factors that may increase the risk of hemorrhoids include: Obesity or being overweight Pregnancy Repeated heavy lifting Coughing or vomiting regularly Age (older people are more susceptible to hemorrhoids) Family history of hemorrhoids Prolonged periods of sitting down Problems with defecation Medical conditions that affect the function of the recum, anal canal and/or the rectum Anal sex (in people who are susceptible to developing hemorrhoids.)",
    "diagnosing_hemorrhoids": "A doctor will usually be able to diagnose hemorrhoids through a look at an individual’s medical history and a physical examination. In cases of internal hemorrhoids, a doctor may perform a digital rectal exam and other procedures. 4\n\nA doctor will inquire about the symptoms being experienced, past or current medical conditions and about any family history of hemorrhoids.\n\nDuring a physical examination, doctors will check the anal area for: Swellings or lumps Signs of prolapsing tissue, i.e. when swellings fall out of the anal opening at rest and while pressing. Stool or mucus leakage Irritated skin Skin tags To check for internal hemorrhoids, a doctor may also perform a digital rectal exam (DRE). During a DRE, a doctor will use gloves and lubricant to examine the inside of the anal passage for abnormalities. The procedure is generally painless, but may cause some mild discomfort.\n\nDuring an anoscopy, a doctor will use an anoscope – a small, lighted tubular device – to check the interior of anal canal and lower rectum. This is an outpatient procedure and will generally not require anesthesia.",
    "hemorrhoids_treatment": "One initial method is to take steps to avoid constipation, and not straining when using the bathroom. However, there are a variety of treatment methods for hemorrhoids.These include: 2 Eating fibre (for example, cereals, fruits and vegetables) Drinking plenty of fluids, not including alcohol and caffeine Avoiding co-codamol - a substance found in certain painkillers Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight. The use of these methods may be enough to treat mild cases of hemorrhoids. However, if symptoms persist, further treatment methods are available.\n\nVarious types of creams and ointments are available to help manage the symptoms of hemorrhoids. Some creams and ointments contain anesthetic that is able to soothe pain and irritation. Doctors and pharmacists are able to advise on the best choice for each individual. In case of ambiguity when using, check the instruction booklet included with the product.\n\nVarious outpatient procedures are available to help treat hemorrhoids. Banding treatment: The most common procedure used to treat hemorrhoids, usually used for grade 2 or 3. It involves wrapping a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid swelling, thus draining the swelling of blood. The band is left there and will eventually cause the hemorrhoid to fall off. This will normally happen after a few days. The procedure is typically painless. Injection sclerotherapy: Special oil is injected into the base of the hemorrhoid in order to cut off the blood supply. This causes the swelling to drop off. Infrared and laser coagulation: Infrared or laser energy is used to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid swellings, causing them to shrink. This procedure is often accompanied by a feeling of some pain and heat. Laser therapy: CO2 lasers are used to cauterise or vaporise hemorrhoids. This is an outpatient procedure, and because the laser seals blood vessels as it cuts the hemorrhoid away, stitches are unnecessary. The procedure generally has minimal pain and speedy recovery. Electrotherapy/Diathermy: An electric current is used to destroy the hemorrhoids. The procedure is generally painless.\n\nSurgical treatment methods are usually reserved for cases of severe hemorrhoids (grade 3 or 4), when other less invasive treatment methods have proven unsuccessful. A doctor will be able to advise on the best option case-by-case. Hemorrhoidectomy: The hemorrhoids are cut away by a surgeon while the individual is under general anaesthetic. It is usually successful in treating hemorrhoids. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy: Less painful than a hemorrhoidectomy, this procedure involves cutting out a circular portion of the mucosa of the anal canal and rectum involving the hemorrhoids. This pulls the hemorrhoids back up the anal canal, cutting off their blood supply and causing them to shrink. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation: The blood vessels around the anal canal that provide blood to the hemorrhoids are tied, causing the hemorrhoids to shrink.",
    "hemorrhoids_prevention": "As the exact cause of hemorrhoids is not fully known, preventing the onset of the condition may not always be possible. However, taking the following steps may be useful: 5 Eating a healthy diet, high in fibre Limiting the amount of time sitting on the toilet and avoiding straining Maintaining a healthy weight",
    "hemorrhoids_faqs": "Q: What is a thrombosed hemorrhoid? A: A thrombosed hemorrhoid is an external hemorrhoid that has no blood supply due to a blood clot in the supplying vein. Although not considered harmful, thrombosed hemorrhoids can be painful. This type of hemorrhoid will normally resolve itself but treatment options are available. If an individual is concerned about a thrombosed hemorrhoid or is experiencing severe pain, they should consult a doctor. 6 Q: Are there any home remedies for hemorrhoids? A: There are a variety of home remedies available to help relieve the symptoms of hemorrhoids. Generally, it is advised that if hemorrhoids are causing pain or discomfort, professional medical advice should be sought. Home remedies include: 7 Warm baths: Soaking in a warm bath may help to relieve the inflammation and irritation caused by hemorrhoids. Witch hazel: An astringent that may help to shrink external hemorrhoids when applied directly. A small amount should be applied to a cotton ball and lightly applied to the affected area. Coconut oil: May help reduce swelling and irritation when applied directly to external hemorrhoids. Aloe vera: The anti-inflammatory properties of aloe vera may help to reduce irritation, swelling and itchiness. Q: Should I be concerned about hemorrhoids while pregnant? A: Hemorrhoids occurring during pregnancy are typically no cause for concern. Anyone can experience hemorrhoids, but they are especially common during pregnancy because of changes in the body’s hormonal balance and rising abdominal pressure. A doctor or midwife will offer advice on how to treat the hemorrhoids. Most of the treatment options available to non-pregnant individuals are also available to pregnant women."

    "condition": "Herpangina",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/herpangina/",
    "what_is_herpangina": "Herpangina is a viral infection of the mouth which is in most cases caused by a particular strain of group A coxsackievirus, but also by group B coxsackievirus, echovirus and enterovirus 71. It affects children more commonly than adults.\n\nThe distinguishing symptom of herpangina is small, blister-like ulcers or lesions on the roof of the mouth and at the back of the throat, which are often painful. It is generally considered to be a non-serious condition that ordinarily clears up in under 10 days. 1 The groups of viruses that cause herpangina are highly contagious. 2\n\nHerpangina is is in most cases caused by a particular strain of group A coxsackievirus, but also by group B coxsackievirus, echovirus and enterovirus 71. Coxsackievirus is an enterovirus, and it is related to poliovirus, echovirus, and other enteroviruses. These viruses are common, and are spread by human-to-human contact, contaminated objects like door handles and cutlery, droplet infection and by contaminated water. 3 A common disease related to herpangina is hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which is caused by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71. 4 Enterovirus 71 has been responsible for several outbreaks in East and Southeast Asia, and it is associated with encephalitis, though this is rare. 5 Hand, foot and mouth disease is very similar to herpangina, causing similar symptoms, including sores and lesions. The difference between herpangina and hand, foot and mouth disease is explained below.",
    "symptoms": "The early symptoms of herpangina are similar to other viral infections that affect the noseand throat. These include: 6 Sore throat Pain when swallowing Headache Sudden fever Neck pain Swollen lymph glands Loss of appetite Drooling and/or vomiting Herpangina is generally considered to be a benign condition, but complications are possible.One of the biggest risks associated with the condition is dehydration, caused by an individual refusing food or water due to discomfort or lack of appetite. Symptoms of dehydration can include: Fatigue Decreased urination Dry mouth. If there is a suspicion of dehydration, seek a medical opinion right away. The symptoms of herpangina will normally disappear within 7 to 10 days. In cases where thehigh fever or ulcers do not disappear after five continuous days, medical advice should besought as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough herpangina is primarily a disease that affects children, adults can contract it, too. It is common for parents to contract herpangina from children who are sick, but fortunately the disease is no more severe in adults than it is in children. However, because unborn children can be affected, it can be a matter for concern if a pregnant woman contracts herpangina; see below. Herpangina in adults has the same symptoms as herpangina in children. These include: Sore throat Pain when swallowing Headache Sudden fever Neck pain Swollen lymph glands Loss of appetite Adults with herpangina do not generally drool or vomit. Although these symptoms are uncomfortable, herpangina in adults has a good prognosis unless other manifestations of enterovirus infections are present. These are rare, but can include aseptic meningitis . Herpangina is much less common in adults and adolescents than it is in children. Herpangina in adults lasts for about ten days. If a pregnant woman contracts herpangina or hand, foot and mouth disease, the virus may affect the unborn child. The infant may be small for their gestational age, have low birth weight, or be born prematurely if they have been exposed to herpangina in utero . If a pregnant woman contracts herpangina, she should consult a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nHerpangina is different from other similar conditions because of the small blisters,later ulcers, which form on the back of the throat. These ulcers will begin to appear within two days after the initial infection. The sores, otherwise referred to as lesions or erythematous macules,  develop towards the back of the mouth and throat. They are typically light red in colour and in most cases less than half a centimeter across. In the later stage of the condition, the ulcers can typically be distinguished by their light grey colour and red border.  These may be confused with aphthous mouth ulcers .\n\nHand, foot and mouth disease is not the same as herpangina but the courses of each disease are quite similar. 4 Like herpangina, HFMD tends to affect younger children but can also, more rarely, affect older children and adults. Some adults may show no symptoms of HFMD. Symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease in adults can be quite severe, but complications rarely occur. The virus can cause inflammation in the heart, lung and brain, which can be very serious. One of the most distinctive differences between HFMD and herpangina is the rash. The rash in herpangina is restricted to the mouth, affecting: 7 The back of the throat The roof of the mouth and soft palate The tonsils The uvula The tongue In hand, foot and mouth disease, the rash may affect: 8 9 The mouth, including the tongue, roof of the mouth, tonsils, uvula and the back of the throat The hands and feet The knees and elbows The buttocks and genitals Unlike the rash caused by chickenpox , the rash caused by HFMD is not itchy, although it may be slightly sore. The lesions are also usually smaller than those characteristic of chickenpox. 9 Good to know: It is not thought that HFMD and herpangina affect the unborn children of women who contract the diseases. However, if the infection occurs in the last three weeks of pregnancy, women should contact their physicians without delay.",
    "causes": "Herpangina is in most cases caused by a particular strain of group A coxsackievirus, but can also be caused by group B coxsackievirus, echovirus and enterovirus 71. Each of these viruses is highly contagious and most common in children younger than 7 years of age. 10 Children aremore susceptible to these viruses because they do not yet possess the antibodies that defend against it. However, it is possible for the condition to affect a person of any age.\n\nTypically, the virus is spread when fecal matter from an infected individual comes into contact with the mouth area. This fecal matter can be carried on the hands, as well as on objects or surfaces. The virus can also be spread via the spray from a cough or sneeze of a person with herpangina. The same is true of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Children may shed the virus in their feces for some weeks after the sores and lesions have healed, so family members and caregivers should take care that everyone maintains good personal and household hygiene. To avoid spreading the viruses responsible for herpangina and HFMD, people who are in contact with infected children or adults should: 8 Take special care to maintain hand hygiene when handling used tissues or soiled diapers/nappies Soiled clothes, sheets, and towels used or worn by affected people should be washed in hot water Take care to cover their nose and mouth while coughing or sneezing Take care not to share plates, cups or glasses, towels or bedding with someone who is or has recently been ill with HFMD or herpangina Avoid piercing the sores or lesions, especially if they are blistered, as the fluid in them contains the virus.",
    "diagnosing_herpangina": "Diagnostic tests are not typically necessary to identify herpangina. Although many of thesymptoms of the virus are common to other conditions, the ulcers are unique, meaning a doctorwill be able to diagnose the virus with a simple examination and questions about theindividual’s other symptoms and medical history. The process for diagnosing hand, foot and mouth disease is similar.",
    "herpangina_treatment": "The infection causing herpangina will usually go away without any particular treatment.Antibiotics are not needed, because the condition is caused by a virus. However, there aretreatments available to relieve the symptoms caused by the infection. The most common treatments for the symptoms of herpangina are: Ibuprofen: Used to ease pain and lessen fever. Acetaminophen/paracetamol: Used to ease pain and lessen fever. Anaesthetics: Numbing throat lozenges, mouthwashes, or teething gels may be helpfulto reduce the pain caused by herpangina. Fluids: To avoid dehydration, it is important to take in plenty of fluids duringinfection and recovery. Water and cold milk are typically recommended as they are easyto swallow and can have a soothing effect. Citrus and hot drinks should be avoided becausethey can be painful to swallow. Aspirin should be avoided as a treatment method, particularly for children and teenagers,who should avoid aspirin completely unless asked to take it by a doctor.",

    "herpangina_faqs": "Q: Can adults contract herpangina? A: Yes, herpangina can occur in people of any age, though the virus is most common inchildren younger than 7 years of age. Q: Are there any home remedies for herpangina? A: There are some home remedies to treat herpangina, mostly aimed at alleviating thepain from mouth ulcers or a sore throat. One of the most common is the use of ice. Applychunks of ice directly to the ulcer for at least 10 minutes twice per day. This should helpease the swelling and lessen the pain. When recovering from herpangina, gargling with saltwater can help the mouth ulcers to heal. 9 Q: How can I avoid spreading herpangina? A: To avoid spreading herpangina, those experiencing the condition should avoid extendedcontact with others and stay home from work or school while feeling unwell. When coughingor sneezing, individuals should take care to cover their mouth and nose, and be sure to washtheir hands thoroughly at regular intervals. Q: Does herpangina pose any risks during pregnancy? A: Herpangina does pose a risk of adverse effects during pregnancy. Women worried aboutherpangina during pregnancy should consult a doctor for advice and take preventative measuresto avoid the virus in the first instance. Q: Can herpangina cause a skin rash? A: Some enteroviral infections can cause skin rashes, also known as exanthems. Althoughthe coxsackievirus that causes herpangina can cause a rash, it is atypical and should beexamined by a doctor. 11 Q: Is herpangina related to herpes? A: Despite the similar sounding names, herpangina and herpes are not related. Both conditions cause ulcers, sores or lesions, but in different locations, moreover the two conditions are caused by separate viruses: herpangina by coxsackieviruses (coxsackie A and B), enterovirus 71 and echovirus, and herpes by herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2). A: Do enteroviruses cause any other conditions? Q: Enteroviruses are a group of viruses that cause a range of viral illnesses. The two most common enteroviruses are coxsackieviruses and echovirus. Other from herpangina, enteroviruses can also cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD; see above), epidemic pleurodynia, and poliomyelitis, among other infectious disorders. 12"

    "what_are_cold_sores": "Cold sores, also known as herpes labialis, is a viral infection. In the majority of cases, it is caused by the so-called herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) but also can be caused by the herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). Patients with cold sores typically have one or more painful blisters on the lips area. 1 Most people get infected with the herpes simplex virus 1 in childhood. The virus is usually transmitted through saliva. In the majority of cases, no symptoms occur during this initial transmission. After infection, the virus remains in the nervous system. Stress and other triggers can lead to the virus reactivating, which then leads to an outbreak of the blisters. These outbreaks can recur over a lifetime. By the age of 40, more than 90 percent of all people are infected with the virus. However, many infected people never have an outbreak. 1 , 2 , 3 Although herpes on the lips is contagious and painful, it is usually a harmless infection. However, it can have serious health consequences if it affects newborns or people with impaired immune systems. 4 , 5 If you think that you might have cold sores, you can try using Ada App to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_causes_cold_sores": "The viruses that cause cold sores are very contagious. The entry port is usually the mucous membrane of the mouth, but the virus can also enter the body through a small wound. Transmission can occur if you come into direct contact with a herpes blister or the saliva of someone who currently has a herpes blister. You can also get infected if you share dishes, cutlery, towels, cosmetic tissues, toothbrushes, toothbrush holder, or razors with someone who currently has cold sores. The people most at risk are those who have a family member or intimate partner with a cold sore outbreak. Since both herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 can cause both cold sores and genital herpes at different frequencies, it is also possible to become infected during oral sexual intercourse if there is mucous membrane contact with an affected person. 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 After the virus has usually persisted for a while in the affected person’s nervous system without causing discomfort, certain factors can lead to reactivation and then to an outbreak. These factors include: 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 fever menstruation sunlight upper respiratory tract infections injuries emotional stress weakened immune system certain medications.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The typical symptoms of cold sores are itching and tingling, followed by painful blisters on the mouth and lip area, from which encrusted wounds eventually develop. The symptoms can last up to two weeks. During the first episode of cold sores, the blisters can be very painful and can also be accompanied by fever, muscle pain, and swelling of the lymph nodes in the face and neck. 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 An outbreak of cold sores typically occurs in several stages: 7 , 8 , 9 Prodromal stage This stage lasts about one to two days. The affected person initially only notices a tingling sensation and possible redness at the site where a blister will form. The blisters in cold sores can occur again and again in the same place. If treatment is already started at this stage, the entire duration of the outbreak can be shortened. Blister stage This stage lasts about two to three days. One or more blisters appear on and around the lips or more rarely around the nostrils. The appearance of blisters is usually accompanied by slight pain, which can be intensified by speaking, laughing, or eating. Weeping stage This is the most painful stage. It lasts about one to three days. The blisters rupture and a clear fluid emerges. Crusting stage This stage is where the bubbles crust and form scabs on the surface. This often leads to itching, and as a result, this stage is often described by those affected as the most unpleasant stage. Healing stage This stage is where the scab and crusted areas fall off. Small, temporary scars can develop until the skin has completely healed. Good to know: Cold sores are contagious during all of these stages. However, the greatest risk of infection is during the third stage. The outbreak of cold sores usually disappears by itself. The affected person is no longer contagious to others from the moment the skin on which the blister was located has completely healed again. If you are not sure if this matches what you’ve been experiencing, check your symptoms with Ada .",
    "how_are_cold_sores_diagnosed": "The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and appearance of the blisters. The examination of the fluid or a tissue sample from a blister can be used to confirm the diagnosis of the herpes virus. However, this is usually only the case if the diagnosis is unclear or if other causes are also likely. With people with a weakened immune system, the diagnostic measures may also need to be more extensive. 1 , 2 , 3",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_cold_sores": "Cold sores can usually be treated quite easily, especially if the treatment is started immediately after the first signs appear. There are several factors that determine the exact type of treatment, which are: Is it a pronounced initial infection or a usually milder reactivation? Does severe pain or fever occur? How regularly do the symptoms occur? Does the affected person have a general immunodeficiency? The treatment differs depending on these considerations. If the symptoms are rare, fairly mild, and the current outbreak is already in one of the later stages (see above), treatment may not be necessary.The available drugs counteract the spreading of the virus. For this reason, treatment with so-called antiviral medication is much more effective if it is started early, even before the virus has been able to multiply and before a blister has formed. Medication for cold sores: If the affected person is alert and notices the onset of cold sores at an early stage (when it is only tingling), a prescription-free antiviral cream, such as acyclovir cream, can be applied. This often prevents the formation of blisters and shortens the outbreak of the virus considerably. Once a blister has formed, the application of creams is less effective. Alternatively, zinc -containing creams or slightly anesthetic creams can be applied. Although these creams can relieve pain, they are not as effective as antiviral creams. Oral antivirals (tablets) are sometimes prescribed by doctors. However, this is the exception and usually only necessary in very severe cases. Since it is the same group of active ingredients as in antiviral creams, antiviral tablets are also much more effective if treatment is started during the prodromal phase (see above). However, if a patient has already developed blisters, doctors may prescribe oral antivirals in certain cases so that the patient can take them to prevent future outbreaks. There is some evidence that oral antivirals may be most effective when prescribed in cases where a patient's cold sore has a known trigger, such as strong sunlight. In such cases, an antiviral tablet may be taken immediately after the person has been exposed to the trigger. This is another form of lip herpes prophylaxis and can prevent an outbreak. There is no evidence that the combination of oral antivirals and antiviral creams reduces the duration of an outbreak more than the use of only one of the two preparations. 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 10",
    "can_cold_sores_be_prevented": "To reduce the risk of spreading herpes simplex viruses, which can cause cold sores and genital herpes , it is important to avoid sexual contact when lesions are present. Of course, outbreaks and lesions are not always noticed by those affected. In these cases, the consistent use of condoms helps, which massively reduces the risk of infection. Whenever cold sores are present, measures should be taken to avoid saliva exchange with others. This includes activities such as kissing, oral sex, and sharing food and other utensils. Mothers with the herpes simplex virus can continue to breastfeed if there are no lesions on the breasts and if lesions on other body parts are completely covered. If there are active lesions on the breast, the mother should temporarily stop breastfeeding from the affected breast and should not feed pumped milk from the affected breast. Before holding the infant, care should be taken to ensure appropriate hand hygiene. Antiviral medications are effective in reducing the duration and severity of outbreaks and are most effective when administered at the first sign of an outbreak. Antiviral tablets may be prescribed in certain cases so that the patient can take them as a prophylaxis against future outbreaks. 1",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_cold_sores": "Cold sores are a chronic viral infection in which symptom-free intervals can alternate with repeated outbreaks. The course is variable from person to person. Some people may have frequent outbreaks, while others remain completely symptom-free. 1Although herpes on the lips is contagious and painful, it is usually a harmless infection. However, it can have serious health consequences if it affects newborns or people with impaired immune systems. 4 , 5",

    "what_is_herpes_simplex": "Herpes simplex, typically referred to as “herpes” or HSV, is a viral infection caused bythe herpes simplex virus. The virus comes in two varieties: Herpes type one (HSV-1) andherpes type two (HSV-2). Although it can occasionally cause genital herpes , herpes type one(also called herpes labialis ) generally leads to sores around the mouth, whereas herpes typetwo generally leads to genital sores. These sores, also known as cold sores or feverblisters, can be painful but are generally manageable. As yet, there is no known cure for the herpes simplex virus. 1",
    "symptoms": "Many people who contract the herpes simplex virus do not display any signs or symptoms ofinfection. If an individual does begin to display symptoms they will normally develop withintwo to 20 days after the initial infection and may include: 2 An itching or burning sensation: This generally precedes the development of sores andcan occur around the mouth or genitals. Sores: May occur singularly or in clusters. Sores begin as fluid-filled blisters andwill generally ooze and crust over before healing. Typically, they last for between seven and 10 days. Oral herpes will normally cause sores to appear on the face or lips, whereas the penis, vagina, buttocks or anus are the most common locations for genital herpes sores. Flu-like symptoms: Fatigue, muscle pain, fever and swollen glands in the neck or genital area are possible. Urination problems: People with genital herpes (especially women) may experience painor a burning sensation when urinating. Eye infection: The herpes simplex virus may spread to the eyes, resulting in possiblepain, discharge and light sensitivity. If left untreated, the infection can lead to scarring on the outer layer of the eye. The infection is sometimes referred to as keratitis and occurs in less than five percent of cases. After the initial infection, herpes simplex can exist in a dormant (latent) state, whereinno symptoms present themselves but the virus is still present within the body. Latentherpes simplex can reactivate because of a number of factors, including: Fever Menstruation Emotional stress. Worried you may have this condition? Start a free symptom assessment on the Ada app . Read more about Signs of Herpes »",
    "causes": "Herpes simplex is transmitted through skin to skin contact between an individual infectedwith the virus and an individual who is not. The carrier of the infection does not need tohave symptoms of the infection in order for it to be transmitted. The infection is highlycontagious. Oral herpes commonly develops, especially in children, through activities such as kissingor sharing eating utensils or toothbrushes. Genital herpes is typically transmitted throughsexual activity, including: 3 Unprotected sex (vaginal or anal) Sharing sex toys Close genital contact. It is also possible for mothers to pass on the herpes simplex virus to their child during birth.",
    "diagnosing_herpes_simplex": "The most common method for diagnosing herpes simplex of both types is a physical examination. A doctor will examine the blisters and sores, inquire about other symptoms, and will generally be able to make a diagnosis on the basis of these. To confirm the presence of the virus, a laboratory test, known as a herpes viral cultureof lesions test, can also be performed. To do so, a sample of fluid is taken from the soresand sent to a lab for testing. 4 Tests are also available to differentiate between herpessimplex virus one and two, including immunofluorescence staining and the immunoblot test (IgG). 5 If there are no visible symptoms of the virus, blood tests can be ordered to diagnose aninfection with the herpes simplex virus. This is known as a serum herpes simplex antibodiestest. After taking blood, the sample will be sent to a laboratory and be tested, not forthe virus itself, but for the presence of the antibodies produced by the body to fight thevirus. 6",
    "treatment": "There is no cure for the herpes simplex virus. However, treatments aimed at lessening the symptoms and controlling recurrent outbreaks are available. The most common treatment method is the use of antiviral creams and ointments. To be most effective, the creams and ointments should be used as soon as the symptoms of herpes appear. The affected area should be kept clean and dry, and no other lotions or ointments should be applied unless they are recommended by a doctor. If the herpes sores are occurring frequently, it may be advised to use the treatments everyday, even when no visible symptoms are present. This is known as suppressive therapy. Medications are usually used for suppressive therapy, the most common being: 7 Acyclovir Valacyclovir Famciclovir Read more about treatment for oral herpes »",
    "herpes_simplex_prevention": "Herpes simplex is most commonly spread by skin to skin contact, as well as through objectsthat have been in contact with herpes sores. Those that have been infected with the virusshould take a number of measures to lessen the risk of transmitting herpes simplex. Theseinclude: Avoid kissing during an outbreak, when the chances of transmitting the virus are highest Avoid sharing things such as toothbrushes and eating utensils Avoid touching the sores (if impossible, ensure the hands are thoroughly washed before coming into contact with anyone else). To reduce the risk of spreading or contracting genital herpes, the most effective methodis to use a condom during vaginal, oral and anal sex. Condoms, however, do not cover allparts of the genital area, meaning they do not guarantee full protection. 8 During an outbreak of the virus, sexual activity should be avoided completely, as this iswhen the chances of transmitting the virus are highest. Sharing sex toys should always beavoided. Complete protection against the virus can only be guaranteed through full abstention from sexual activity.",
    "herpes_simplex_prognosis": "In otherwise healthy children and adults, herpes simplex rarely leads to any severecomplications. However, newborn babies and people with weakened immune systems can suffersevere and serious complications. One complication that has been linked to herpes simplexis encephalitis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition affecting the brain.[9] When newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems show symptoms of the virus,professional medical attention should be sought quickly. In all cases, the virus never leaves the body and may lay dormant indefinitely. The firstoutbreak (the primary outbreak) is generally the most aggressive, with recurrences typicallymilder and less painful. 9",
    "other_names_for_herpes_simplex": "Herpes HSV",
    "herpes_simplex_faqs": "Q: Can I catch herpes on parts of the body that aren’t the mouth or genitals? A: The herpes simplex virus normally affects either the mouth (type one) or the genitals(type 2). However, though rare, the virus can also affect other parts of the body such as: The fingers (known as herpetic whitlow) The nipples The arms When this happens, the virus is normally spread from the mouth or genitals. Q: Can I pass on herpes simplex when displaying no symptoms? A: Yes. Even when the virus is dormant, it can still be passed on. However, this is lesslikely than when physical symptoms are present. 10 Q: Can I catch genital herpes from kissing on the mouth? A: This is unlikely. Kissing can transmit the herpes simplex virus type 1, which cancause both oral and genital herpes. However, kissing on the mouth will not cause thedevelopment of symptoms on the genitals."

    "condition": "Herpes Zoster Infection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/herpes-zoster-infection/",
    "what_is_herpes_zoster_infection": "Herpes zoster infection, often known as shingles, is a common viral infection caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus. The varicella zoster virus is also known as herpes zoster and is a member of the human herpesvirus family. Around one in three people in the United States will develop shingles in their lives, with 1 million cases in the country each year. 1 All people that develop shingles will have had chickenpox at some point in their lives, usually during childhood. The the varicella zoster virus remains dormant in the body after a person has had chickenpox . After chickenpox, which is the acute form of varicella zoster infection, the virus lies dormant in nerves, and it can reactivate years later and cause new symptoms. 2 Herpes zoster infection is more likely to affect older people and people with a weak immune system. It causes a burning pain, followed by a painful blistering rash, which tends to only affect one area of the body. If you think that you might have shingles, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Shingles is treated with antiviral medications.** The rash will usually begin to get better within two weeks, and although most people recover well, some may be left with persistent pain in the affected area. Effective pain management from the early stages is therefore very important. Some complications of shingles, for example herpes zoster ophthalmicus, can lead to permanent problems with eyesight. People with shingles should avoid contact with people who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox and people who have a weakened immune system.",
    "symptoms": "The first sign of herpes zoster infection is often a painful sensation in one area of the body. The pain is commonly described as: 3 4 Burning Stabbing Itching Tingling Numbness The most commonly known symptom of shingles is the rash. Where the rash appears will depend on what part of the body the herpes zoster virus has been dormant in. The rash appears on the dermatome associated with the affected nerve. Good to know: A dermatome is the area of skin supplied by a particular nerve. The varicella zoster virus lies dormant in the cranial and spinal nerves. When the virus is reactivated, it travels along the affected nerves to the area of the skin served by those nerves, where it causes a distinctive, stripe-like rash. 5 The rash is most common on the chest, back, shoulders or face. Pain and the accompanying rash can occur anywhere on the body, depending on which nerve is affected by the infection. Several symptoms may appear before the rash develops. These are known as prodromal symptoms and include: 5 6 Itching Burning sensations or discomfort when the skin is touched Flu-like symptoms such as fever, malaise and fatigue Upset stomach Between one and five days after the pain begins, a rash will develop in the same area: 2 3 4 The rash is vesicular; vesicles are small, blister-like sacs that appear on the surface of the skin The skin around the vesicular rash becomes red The rash is generally confined to one area of the body in a stripe-like pattern; usually one side of the body or, in some cases, the face. In immunosuppressed people the rash may be more widespread The rash blisters burst and scab over, usually seven to 10 days after first appearing The rash generally goes away after two to four weeks About one in every ten people with shingles will experience the onset of pain and the rash simultaneously. Good to know: If someone has a healthy immune system, they are said to be immunocompetent. If they have a weak or damaged immune system, they are said to be immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. Most people will only experience shingles once, though less than 4 percent will have another episode. 2 If you are concerned that you might have shingles, you can try using the Ada app for a free assessment. Read more about Signs of Shingles »\n\nOccasionally, shingles can occur without a rash of blisters: this is known as <em>zoster sine herpete.</em> In this form of the condition, the affected person will experience all the usual prodromal symptoms, such as fever and itching or burning, but does not then develop blisters. 7 They may also develop a raised red area on the area of skin where they feel the itching or burning. People with this condition experience pain and discomfort in the same dermatomal distribution as normal shingles, but the skin of the affected area may be red. <em>Zoster sine herpete</em> can be diagnosed using tests rather than physical examination. 8",
    "causes": "People at risk of developing shingles are those who have had chickenpox in the past. Herpes zoster infection occurs years, often decades, after a person has been infected with the varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox. The virus remains dormant in the body in the ganglia of the sensory cranial nerves and spinal dorsal root (see FAQs ). If a person’s immunity to varicella zoster weakens over time, either due to age or if a person is immunosuppressed, the virus can reactivate. This reactivation is called herpes zoster infection, or shingles. 5 Conditions and situations that can suppress the immune system and make someone more at risk of developing shingles include: 9 HIV/AIDS Receiving chemotherapy Diabetes Having the spleen removed ‒ for example, due to damage from injury or infection Hypogammaglobulinemia, a condition where the body does not make enough antibodies If you have a condition which affects your general health, and are experiencing symptoms that may be those of shingles, you can check your symptoms using the free Ada app at any time.",
    "diagnosis": "A diagnosis can usually be made based on the symptoms and the appearance of the rash. If there is uncertainty, the diagnosis can be confirmed with blood tests or by taking a sample of fluid from a blister and testing for the virus.",
    "complications": "Shingles can cause complications if it affects the eye and the ear. It can also cause long-lasting pain even after the rash has gone. Good to know: People who are older than 60 years of age are particularly vulnerable to complications of shingles and should visit a doctor as soon as they develop symptoms. 10 Rarely, shingles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis or a secondary bacterial infection of the skin. 10\n\nHerpes zoster ophthalmicus, or ophthalmic shingles, is a variant of shingles where the virus affects the ophthalmic nerve and eye, causing pain and inflammation in the eye and face. If not treated quickly, it has the potential to cause permanent vision problems, including: 11 12 13 Glaucoma Scarring of the tissues of the eye Retinal necrosis, a condition in which the retina becomes inflamed Iritis or uveitis , inflammation of the tissues of the eye Cataracts Secondary bacterial infections of the eye can also occur if the affected eye becomes dry and sustains small scratches as a result of the inflammation . Some people find that prescriptions gels, ointments or drops that lubricate the eye are useful in relieving discomfort caused by dry eyes. 13 Read more about Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus »\n\nHerpes zoster oticus, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome, occurs when the herpes zoster virus affects facial nerves. In this way it is like herpes zoster opthalmicus, but in this case the pain affects the ear. HZO is a rare form of shingles that causes pain deep within the ear and facial palsy as well as the rash. With treatment, most people will recover full use of facial nerves. 14 Treating herpes zoster oticus involves antiviral medications and pain management. (For more information, see the treatment section.)\n\nSome people infected with herpes zoster will continue to feel pain in the affected areas of the body. Pain that persists for three months or longer is called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). 2 Postherpetic neuralgia pain is caused by damage to nerves during the shingles infection. It is more common in older people, rising to 20 percent of people 80 years and older experiencing PHN after shingles. 5 Symptoms and effects of postherpetic neuralgia include: Sharp pain Intermittent or constant pain Allodynia, which is pain caused by light touches or the feel of clothing on skin Difficulty sleeping The experience of living with PHN may bring on clinical depression .",
    "treatment": "Herpes zoster infection is usually treated with antiviral medication in people who are immunocompetent. These drugs helps shorten the duration and lessen the severity of shingles by easing the associated pain and promoting healing of the blisters. Medication should be taken as soon as possible after the rash appears. 15 Drugs often prescribed include: 16 17 18 19 Acyclovir. Taken orally, acyclovir has been the traditional antiviral for use in shingles treatment. However, other drugs have been developed which can be taken less frequently and are better absorbed by the body. Famciclovir. Taken orally, famciclovir converts to the compound penciclovir which is effective against the varicella zoster virus. Valacyclovir. Taken orally, valacyclovir treats pain and itching and helps sores to heal while preventing new sores forming. Common side-effects of these drugs can include: 17 18 19 Headache Nausea and vomiting Upset stomach Diarrhea Constipation Tiredness Painful menstruation Some doctors may prescribe steroid tablets to reduce swelling and itching, but this is not recommended in most cases. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, or other analgesics, may also help to reduce the pain and swelling. People with shingles should try to avoid scratching at the rash. Calamine lotion and wet compresses can help soothe the itching.\n\nPeople whose immune systems are compromised are more likely to experience complications from shingles, which can include: 20 21 The rash spreading across the body Infection of the lesions, usually due to Staphylococcus aureus Pneumonia Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain Blindness Deafness caused by herpes zoster oticus It is even more important to treat immunosuppressed people with antiviral drugs to limit complications, potentially requiring hospitalization to administer drugs intravenously. The antiviral drugs are the same as those given to immunocompetent people.\n\nEarly prescription of painkillers to people with herpes zoster infection is advised to try and prevent the development of postherpetic neuralgia. Types of painkillers prescribed may include: Ibuprofen Paracetamol (acetaminophen) Codeine Tramadol Oxycodone Morphine Good to know: Codeine, tramadol, oxycodone and morphine are opioid painkillers and should only be used if ibuprofen and paracetamol alone prove ineffective. If postherpetic neuralgia develops, it can also be treated with: 5 Topical creams, such as lidocaine and capsaicin, to ease pain and allodynia in particular Antidepressants, such as tricyclics or selective serotonin (SSRIs) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) to relieve pain and counter effects of clinical depression Anticonvulsants, such as pregabalin or gabapentin, to relieve neuropathic pain",
    "prevention": "People who have shingles should keep away from people who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox, especially newborns, pregnant people, and people who have a weak immune system. People who need to be especially cautious around people with shingles include: Pregnant people who are not vaccinated against varicella zoster or who have not had chickenpox People with compromised immune systems as a result of organ transplants, leukemia, cancer or HIV People with compromised immune systems as a result of medication, such as steroids or chemotherapy Newborn babies Young, unvaccinated children The elderly, especially those with existing health conditions Although shingles itself cannot be passed from person to person, the varicella zoster virus which causes chickenpox can be transmitted by contact with the fluid in the rash blisters. 22 If you or someone you care for have recently been around someone with shingles and are concerned that you or they may have contracted chickenpox, you can do a free symptom assessment using the [Ada app]9https://app.adjust.com/e8ex7r4?redirect_macos=https%3A%2F%2Fappstore.com%2Fadapersonalhealthcompanion).\n\nVaccination against chickenpox (the varicella vaccination) and herpes zoster (a herpes zoster vaccination) can help to prevent and reduce the severity of some cases of shingles. The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all healthy adults aged 50 and older should receive a shingles vaccine. This is especially recommended, because older adults are more at risk of developing complications from shingles. Depending on the age of the person receiving the vaccine, it is between 89 and 97 percent effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. 23",
    "other_names_for_herpes_zoster_infection": "Shingles",
    "faqs_for_herpes_zoster_infection": "Q: Is herpes zoster contagious? A: Herpes zoster (shingles) itself is not contagious - this means that someone with shingles cannot give shingles to someone with whom they come into contact. However, it is possible for someone with shingles to pass on the varicella virus through contact with fluid from the rash blisters. If the person who contracts the virus is not vaccinated, they may then contract the virus and develop chickenpox . Q: How long is someone with shingles contagious for? A: The person with shingles is contagious until the rash develops crusts. 24 Q: Can children get shingles? A: Yes: anyone who has had chickenpox can develop shingles, including children. However, this is rare. 25 Shingles is much more common among older adults than it is among children or young adults. 10 Q: What can someone with shingles do to avoid passing on the varicella virus to others? A: Someone who has shingles should keep their hands clean, avoid scratching the rash and keep the rash covered, if possible. The shingles virus is not spread through coughing or sneezing, but it can be spread through direct contact with the rash. 25 Q: Who should avoid contact with someone who has an active shingles rash? A: People who are at particular risk of shingles, and who should therefore avoid someone with shingles, include: 10 24 25 People who have not had chickenpox and are not vaccinated against it People who are pregnant and have had neither chickenpox nor the vaccine against it People who have weakened immune systems due to medications such as steroids or organ-transplant drugs, or medical conditions such as cancer, HIV or leukemia. People undergoing chemotherapy should also avoid contact with someone affected by shingles. The elderly Unvaccinated children Newborns and very young infants Q: What are the cranial sensory nerves and spinal nerves, and what role do they play in shingles infection? A: The sensory cranial nerves are the nerves in the head which are responsible for sensations such as sight and smell. There are many pairs of spinal nerves along the vertebrae; each nerve has a dorsal root and an anterior root. The anterior root allows motor neurons to leave the spinal cord, while the dorsal root allow sensory neurons to enter the spinal cord. 26 A sensory neuron is a special type of nerve cell that transmits sensory stimuli such as touch, smell, sight and so on. In the skin, these are concerned primarily with touch. Neurons can be quite long, and their cell bodies collect in structures known as ganglia. 27 The dorsal and ventral roots merge together to form the spinal nerve. 28 The varicella zoster virus usually affects the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves and lies dormant in the ganglia. Q: Can you get shingles more than once? A: In most cases, a person only has shingles once. However, some people have shingles two or three times in their lifetime. 25 Q: What is the relationship between shingles and Guillain-Barre Syndrome? A: Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a very rare complication of shingles. 29 Guillain-Barre Syndrome is a rare condition that usually occurs after a viral or bacterial infection. Although there is as yet no medical consensus about what causes Guillain-Barre Syndrome, it is known to be a condition in which the body’s immune system attacks its own peripheral nervous system. The severity of the condition can vary, ranging from temporary weakness to severe paralysis. However, most people with Guillain-Barre Syndrome do recover. It is somewhat more common among older people. 30 Q: What is the relationship between shingles and HIV? A: People with HIV may experience shingles earlier in life than people without HIV and may need more aggressive antiviral treatment for varicella zoster than people without HIV. Shingles can occur at any time after infection with HIV, which is associated with multiple recurrences of shingles, rather than the more usual one episode per lifetime. People with HIV are at somewhat higher risk of complications from shingles, including disseminated varicella zoster. 31 In most cases of varicella zoster infection, the rash is limited to one dermatome, but in people with compromised immune systems, the condition may become disseminated, meaning that it spreads throughout the body. 32 It can affect both the skin and the organs. Disseminated varicella zoster usually requires inpatient treatment in a hospital. 31 Q: Can shingles be treated with essential oils? A: While many people claim that essential oils can be used to treat the rash for shingles, their effectiveness in this regard has not yet been conclusively proven by scientific study. 33 34 Always seek medical advice before using any natural remedies instead of, or in addition to, the recommended treatment plan. They may be unsuitable for certain people, and their use may be inadvisable in combination with particular medications. Q: Can shingles be fatal? A: Shingles is almost never fatal. However, in people who are physically debilitated, such as the very elderly or  the very immunocompromised, shingles may make death more likely. 35 Q: Does shingles bleed? A: While the rash associated with shingles may sometimes ooze small amounts of serum, it is not normal for it to produce pus or to bleed. If someone with shingles has a rash that is bleeding or is producing pus, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. People with shingles should avoid scratching the rash, even though it is itchy, because they may cause bleeding and/or introduce bacteria to the broken skin, which may lead to a secondary infection. Q: Can shingles leave scars? A: Rarely, a severe shingles rash may lead to scarring or loss of pigment in affected skin. Scratching can cause the blisters to become inflamed and/or infected, which can lead to scarring."

This is followed up to a week later by a blistering rash: 3 The rash is vesicular; vesicles are small, blister-like sacs that appear on the surface of the skin The skin around the vesicular rash becomes red The rash is generally confined to one side of the face. In people with weakened immune systems, the rash may be more widespread The rash blisters burst and scab over, usually seven to 10 days after first appearing The rash generally goes away after two to four weeks\n\nAs well as the rash, people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus often develop: A painful, watering eye on the same side as the rash Swelling around the eye In some cases, ocular problems\n\nPeople with shingles may also experience: Headache Fever Chills Loss of appetite Read more about Signs of Shingles »",
    "what_causes_herpes_zoster_ophthalmicus": "Only those who have previously had chickenpox are at risk of developing shingles or ophthalmic shingles. Herpes zoster infection occurs years, sometimes decades, after a person has been infected with the varicella zoster virus that causes chickenpox. The virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system and can reactivate if a person’s immunity to varicella zoster weakens over time, either due to age or if another condition causes a person’s immune system to weaken. Stress and/or illness may trigger a reactivation of the virus. In ophthalmic shingles, the virus reactivates in the trigeminal ganglion, a cluster of nerves located at the sides and base of the skull. The trigeminal ganglion is connected to the ophthalmic nerve. If the virus reactivates, it travels up the nerve to the skin and the eye, and this is how the infection affects the eye. People with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop herpes zoster ophthalmicus than the general population. A weakened immune system may be the result of various conditions, such as: Chemotherapy for cancer Leukemia HIV infection Immunosuppressive drugs taken before or after an organ transplant Long-term use of certain drugs, such as steroids",
    "diagnosis": "A diagnosis can usually be made based on the symptoms and the appearance of the rash, as well as through an examination of the eye. If uncertain, the diagnosis can be confirmed with blood tests or by taking a sample of fluid from a blister and testing for the virus. An ophthalmologist should examine the eye for signs of corneal disease and other eye problems. 4",
    "how_to_treat_herpes_zoster_ophthalmicus": "Ophthalmic shingles should be treated urgently with oral antiviral medication, which helps to manage the pain and reduces the risk of complications occurring. Drugs often prescribed to treat ophthalmic shingles include: 5 Acyclovir Famciclovir Valacyclovir People who have a weakened immune system or who develop severe vision problems may need to receive acyclovir intravenously (through a drip). Eye drops containing corticosteroids may also be needed. They should be taken with care due to the potential of an increased risk of eye complications such as keratitis. Anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, or other analgesics, may help reduce the pain and swelling. People with shingles should try to avoid scratching the rash. Calamine lotion and wet compresses can help soothe the itching. It is important to consult a medical practitioner before putting anything on or in the eye, and it is very important to avoid scratching the eye or the area around the eye, as bacterial infections may occur and lead to complications.",
    "complications": "Possible complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus include: 2 6 Conjunctivitis: Inflammation of the lining of the eye Keratitis: Inflammation of the cornea, which could lead to visual impairment Blepharitis: Inflammation of the eyelid Uveitis: Inflammation of the iris and ciliary body 7 in the eye Episcleritis: Inflammation of a clear layer over the white of the eye Scleritis: A serious condition in which the white of the eye becomes inflamed Retinal necrosis: This can produce pain and/or blurred vision, and can ultimately lead to blindness People with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop ocular complications from ophthalmic shingles.\n\nSome people with herpes zoster ophthalmicus will experience postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), which is pain that lasts after the rash and blisters disappear. Symptoms include: 2 Pain in the eye and area of the face affected by herpes zoster ophthalmicus. This may be constant or intermittent. Allodynia is when pain is triggered by non-painful stimuli, such as light touch or wind blowing on the face. The number of people who will experience postherpetic neuralgia ranges from 10 to 30 percent. The experience of living with postherpetic neuralgia may affect a person’s mental health; for example, it can increase the risk of clinical depression .",
    "prevention": "People who have shingles should keep away from people who have not been vaccinated against chickenpox (especially newborns and young children, as well as pregnant people) and people who have a weak immune system. 1\n\nVaccination against chickenpox (the varicella vaccination) and herpes zoster (a herpes zoster vaccination) can help to prevent and reduce the severity of some cases of shingles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all healthy adults aged 50 and older should receive the shingles vaccine. Depending on the age of the person receiving the vaccine, it is between 89 and 97 percent effective at preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. 8 9",

    "faqs_for_herpes_zoster_ophthalmicus": "Q: Is herpes zoster ophthalmicus contagious? A: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus itself is not contagious. However, it is possible for someone with this condition to pass on the varicella virus that causes chickenpox through contact with fluid from the rash blisters. Q: Is herpes zoster ophthalmicus the same as herpes keratitis? A: Herpes keratitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, the same virus that causes cold sores and genital herpes . Infection can be spread to the eye by touching an active lesion and then the eye. It specifically affects the cornea of the eye, and symptoms include: Pain Redness A Rash Blurred vision Herpes keratitis can lead to permanent vision problems. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is caused by the varicella virus, which causes chickenpox . The virus stays dormant in the body and can later reactivate and cause herpes zoster, otherwise known as shingles. Sometimes, shingles affects the eye and can cause keratitis as a complication. Q: Can herpes zoster ophthalmicus cause long-term problems for the eye? A: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus, if not adequately treated, can cause: Glaucoma Cataracts Scarring inside the eye These are long-term problems requiring management and, in some cases, surgery. Additionally, if a secondary bacterial skin infection develops, the eye may be damaged, and that damage may affect vision. 10 Q: Can herpes zoster ophthalmicus cause light sensitivity? A: Yes. Light sensitivity, also called photosensitivity, is a common symptom of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, along with: Redness Swelling of the eyelid Pain in and around the eye Q: Is it safe to wear contact lenses during an episode of herpes zoster ophthalmicus? A: No. People with herpes zoster ophthalmicus should not wear their usual prescription contact lenses while the condition is present but should switch to wearing glasses. Contact lenses may increase the risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection, 11 as well as being uncomfortable. In some cases, however, special contact lenses may be used for treatment, usually in combination with antibiotic eye drops. 11 Q: Can herpes zoster ophthalmicus cause blindness? A: Yes, although this is a rare complication 12 13 and is very unlikely to occur if the condition is properly treated. Blindness is more likely in cases where a secondary bacterial infection of the affected eyeball and skin causes inflammation of the tissues in that area. 10 Abscesses are a common complication of secondary bacterial inflammation. Glaucoma and cataracts are other complications of herpes zoster ophthalmicus that may also lead to blindness if not treated. 10 Q: What are the symptoms of herpes simplex keratitis? A: Herpes simplex keratitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, not the varicella zoster virus. Symptoms include: 14 Pain in or around one eye Redness of the eye A feeling that grit, dust, or dirt is in the eye A very watery eye Swelling and/or cloudiness of the cornea Vision problems Sensitivity to light The symptoms of herpes simplex keratitis are quite similar to those of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, but there is no shingles rash on the face or head in cases of herpes simplex keratitis. 14"

    "condition": "HIV and AIDS",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/hiv-aids/",
    "what_is_hiv": "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus . Categorized as an sexually transmitted disease (STD) , HIV can be passed on through sexual contact. The virus attacks the immune system or, more specifically, CD4 cells. HIV gradually increases in the blood which, in turn, causes a decrease in the amount of CD4 cells. As the immune system protects us from viruses and bacteria, over time, people with HIV will become more likely to get an array of conditions. 1 2",
    "what_is_the_difference_between_hiv_vs_aids": "HIV occurs in three phases. The first phase takes place right after the moment of infection. In this phase, the virus multiplies rapidly and destroys CD4 cells. Because of the speed at which the virus multiplies, a lot of HIV is present in the blood of people with an acute HIV infection . This makes it more likely for them to transmit the virus to another person . Getting diagnosed and starting treatment in this phase is very beneficial for the outlook of the condition. 1 Once the acute infection is over, HIV evolves into a chronic infection in the second phase . Other terms that refer to this phase are asymptomatic HIV infection or clinical latency. In this stage, the virus is still present in the blood and is still multiplying, but at a slower rate. While the condition progresses, the CD4 count lowers and the immune system progressively gets weaker.\n\nPeople with chronic HIV usually stay in this phase for years to decades. Most of the time, people don’t show any symptoms during this period. To slow down the progression of this condition, there’s an HIV therapy called ART which stands for antiretroviral therapy. This is a combination of medications which people take daily in order to keep their viral load down to an undetectable level. This means that the amount of HIV in the blood is that low that it can’t be detected by a viral load test. Taking your antiretroviral medications correctly is also a possible way to protect your partner, as HIV can't be transmitted if your viral load is undetectable. This means that there is not enough HIV in your bodily fluids to pass on the infection. Current guidelines recommend that all who have been infected with HIV must start ART as soon as possible, regardless of the CD4 count. 3 Without treatment, people can stay in the chronic phase for about a decade before developing AIDS. Correct and consistent treatment can postpone the evolution from chronic HIV to AIDS for decades. Some patients even never develop AIDS. 2 4 5 People that do develop AIDS are in the third phase of their HIV infection. In this phase, people can get serious symptoms and opportunistic infections as the immune system will already be very damaged. Opportunistic infections are infections such as candidiasis, pneumonia and tuberculosis , that people with a healthy immune system would normally not get. People with AIDS do get these infections easily and get severe symptoms. As people with AIDS have a higher viral load than people with chronic HIV, they become very infectious again. 4 5",
    "what_is_usually_the_first_sign": "The signs of HIV are different according to the phase someone is in. People with an acute HIV infection often show no symptoms of the infection. Others do show symptoms, but they are general symptoms which may easily be taken for another condition such as the flu, mononucleosis or a common cold. The most common first signs of an acute HIV infection are : HIV mouth sores HIV rash Fever Other HIV symptoms may also be present such as: 6 7 HIV tongue : contains white fuzzy patches that can’t be scraped off Aching muscles Joint pains Unintentional weight loss Loss of coordination Tiredness Headache Swollen lymph nodes Sore throat Diarrhea Depression and anxiety Skin rash After this phase, the infection becomes chronic and people may not show any symptoms for years or decades. When the immune system is severely damaged and the viral load goes up again, people with HIV transition into the third stage, where they develop AIDS. AIDS makes people susceptible to opportunistic infections and causes a number of severe AIDS symptoms such as: Weight loss Night sweats Chronic diarrhea Recurrent infections Extreme fatigue Skin sores Life-threatening illnesses HIV symptoms in men are mostly the same as HIV symptoms in women . In later stages where HIV has already progressed, women can be prone to opportunistic infections such as lower belly infections and vaginal yeast infections. 6 7",
    "how_do_you_get_hiv_which_can_evolve_to_aids": "HIV can be transmitted from a person with a detectable viral load onto another person. There are certain bodily fluids that can contain the virus , such as: Blood Semen and pre-seminal fluid Rectal fluids Vaginal fluids Breast milk To infect someone, these fluids need to enter the bloodstream of that person. This can happen through intercourse, open wounds or injections. A mother can also transmit HIV to her baby during pregnancy , birth or breastfeeding. 8",
    "is_aids_curable": "There is no cure for HIV or AIDS, but people that have HIV can still live a normal life if they correctly adhere to their therapy . In general, the earlier the diagnosis and treatment, the better the outlook of the condition. Many people can even prevent HIV from evolving into AIDS by keeping their viral load low with their medications. On top of that, there are a number of things you can do to prevent getting HIV . These include: Practising abstinence or safe sex with the correct use of a condom Safe use of needles The use of PreP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), which is a drug taken before a possible exposure to HIV that prevents infection with the virus The use of PeP (post-exposure prophylaxis), which can prevent users from contracting HIV if it’s taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. 9 If you think that you might be at risk for HIV, you should get an HIV test as soon as possible. There are various possibilities when it comes to HIV testing: 10 11 12 You can get tested at a clinic, by your healthcare provider or with a convenient test kit send to your home. Your doctor will draw some blood and will perform an antigen/antibody test or a nucleic acid test (NAT). Both tests can detect HIV or the antibodies that fight HIV in the blood, but depending on when you think you might have contracted it, one or the other may be more appropriate. You can read more about these tests on our specific page about acute HIV-infections by clicking the link . An HIV antibody test, which also searches for HIV antibodies in the blood or oral fluid. This can be an at home HIV test or a rapid HIV test, and can detect HIV 23 to 90 days after infection. An HIV test kit that you use at home is accurate and reliable, although the window period between infection and HIV being visible in the blood must be taken into account. If you did contract HIV , you should discuss the treatment with your doctor. There is no HIV cure or an AIDS cure available at the moment, but the disease can be managed by following guidelines and being consistent with your HIV medications. ART (antiretroviral therapy) can keep your viral load low enough so that you stay healthy and you don’t put others at risk. 10 11 12 HIV vaccines are constantly being researched, and although none of them are approved by governmental healthcare services yet, there are promising trials being conducted. 13 14 15",
    "hiv_aids_and_covid_19": "As people with HIV often have underlying health conditions, they may be at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 . Learn more about the link between HIV, AIDS, and COVID-19 and the interactions between COVID-19 treatments and HIV medicine here .",
    "hiv_and_aids_faqs": "Q: Can you get HIV from kissing? A: Getting HIV from kissing is very unlikely. The virus doesn’t spread through air or saliva. The only way to get HIV from kissing is when both partners have an open wound in the mouth so that there can be an exchange of contaminated blood. Q: What does AIDS stand for? A: AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Q: How long does it take to show symptoms of HIV? A: Usually it takes 2 to 6 weeks after the infection for symptoms to appear. However, some people may not experience symptoms of an acute HIV infection at all. Q: What does “non-reactive HIV test” mean? A: A non-reactive HIV test means that there were no HIV antibodies or antigens found in the blood sample that was collected. Q: How long can you live with HIV? A: People who consistently take their HIV medications and who started treatment early can live long and healthy lives."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/hiv-swollen-lymph-node/",
    "overview": "Swollen lymph nodes can be one of the early signs of an HIV infection. Swollen lymph nodes due to HIV can be found in the armpit, the neck, or the groin. Other lymph nodes can be affected as well. Lymph nodes can appear swollen due to the infection with HIV itself. In a later stage, HIV can compromise the immune system, leading to opportunistic infections. These infections can also cause swollen lymph nodes.\n\nHIV swollen lymph nodes are an essential characteristic that can help with early HIV detection , as the enlargement of lymph nodes due to HIV is the result of the immune system reacting to the virus. As swollen lymph nodes can be caused by several reasons apart from an infection with HIV, it's important to know how HIV affects the lymphatic system. In this article, you can find more information about how HIV affects the lymph nodes, the characteristics of lymph nodes affected by HIV, and when you should see your doctor.",
    "how_does_hiv_cause_swollen_lymph_nodes": "Lymph nodes form an important part of the immune system , and can be found throughout the body. However, they’re clustered together in a few places, such as the groin, the axilla, the neck, the chest, and the abdomen. The lymph nodes contain white blood cells , which play a vital role in protecting the body against infection and illnesses. 1 When your immune system actively fights a disease or an infection with a virus or a bacteria, the lymph nodes can swell. This swelling of the lymph nodes is also referred to as lymphadenopathy . An infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be a possible cause for swollen lymph nodes. If you’ve been infected with HIV, then you can develop swollen lymph nodes in the early stage of the infection as a reaction to the body fighting the virus. You can also notice swollen lymph nodes in the late stage of an HIV infection, as a result of opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis or toxoplasmosis. These opportunistic infections occur more often or are more severe in people with weakened immune systems than in healthy ones. 2 3 HIV and swollen lymph nodes are closely connected, but there are many other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes , such as: 4 Common illnesses such as the common cold, tonsillitis Other viral or bacterial infections Certain cancers Sexually transmitted illness There are many possible reasons for swollen lymph nodes, so it’s crucial to see your healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and treatment.",
    "how_do_hiv_lymph_nodes_feel": "HIV lymph nodes can be enlarged. Sometimes, you can feel a single enlarged lymph node, which can feel like a bean underneath the skin. In other instances, you could notice an entire cluster of swollen lymph nodes. Swollen lymph nodes caused by HIV infection are usually painful and tender to touch, although they can also appear without any pain . The swelling of the lymph nodes may be accompanied by redness and warmth . Lymph nodes affected by HIV usually appear swollen for an extended period and may remain that way for a long time. 2 You should consult with your healthcare provider if: 3 Your lymph nodes have been swollen for over a week Your lymph nodes feel hard Your lymph nodes do not move when you press on them You're experiencing a fever You have no other signs of illness You have swollen lymph nodes in the region of your collarbone",

Most often, HIV can cause swollen lymph nodes in the groin, the neck, or the armpits . Other parts of the body can also be affected by the virus. 2 4",
    "how_long_do_hiv_lymph_nodes_last": "The lymph nodes are often seen as a reservoir for the human immunodeficiency virus. Once the virus enters the body, it's picked up and brought to the nearest lymph nodes. The reaction from the immune system that occurs here can lead to the swelling of the lymph nodes, which can be long-lasting due to the hardening of the lymphatic tissue. When starting up antiretroviral therapy (ART), the levels of human immunodeficiency virus can be reduced, which resolves the swelling of the lymph nodes. If left untreated, swollen lymph nodes due to HIV will also resolve on their own after the acute first phase of HIV. This does not mean the virus is no longer present, so you should always seek advice about the cause of your lymph node swelling and get the appropriate treatment. 5 Swollen lymph nodes from HIV usually appear within 3 to 6 days after the initial infection with the virus. In the first stage of HIV, the lymph nodes can remain swollen for some days to several weeks. 4 5 In the late stage of HIV, opportunistic infections can develop. These infections can also cause the lymph nodes to swell. It's essential to take your HIV medication consistently so that your immune system is supported and opportunistic infections are less likely to develop.",
    "wrapping_up": "HIV can affect your lymph nodes, causing them to appear swollen both in the early stages of HIV and later on due to opportunistic infections. As swollen lymph nodes are a vital indication of an infection, it's crucial always to get them checked. This is especially true if your lymph nodes have been swollen for over a week. Your healthcare provider can then assess the cause of the swelling and recommend the appropriate treatment.",
    "hiv_swollen_lymph_nodes_faqs": "Q: Are swollen lymph nodes in the neck due to HIV? A: Swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be due to HIV, although they can be caused by several other illnesses as well, such as tonsillitis, tooth infections, measles, the flu, etc. Besides the neck region, early HIV can also cause swollen lymph nodes in the groin and the armpit. Q: Do HIV lymph nodes go away? A: HIV lymph nodes go away after starting antiretroviral treatment. They also go away on their own after some time, which does not mean the virus is no longer present in the body. HIV should always be treated. Q: Are HIV lymph nodes visible? A: HIV lymph nodes may be visible in some instances, especially in the neck and armpit region. Q: Does HIV cause swollen lymph nodes? A: A common HIV symptom is swollen lymph nodes. This can happen in the early stage of the infection. In a later stage, opportunistic infections can develop, which can also cause swollen lymph nodes. Q: Which lymph nodes swell with HIV? A: Several lymph nodes can swell with HIV. The main regions where lymph nodes swell due to HIV are the axillary region, the groin, and the neck. Any lymph nodes throughout the body can be affected, though. Q: How long after HIV infection do lymph nodes swell? A: It usually takes 3 to 6 days after exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus for the lymph nodes to swell. This swelling happens as part of the immune system's reaction to the virus. Q: At what stage of HIV do you get swollen lymph nodes? A: Swollen lymph nodes can be caused by HIV in the first stage as a reaction from the immune system to the virus itself. In a later stage, opportunistic infections can arise as a consequence of poorly managed HIV. These infections can also cause the lymph nodes to swell."

Sharing needles or syringes, particularly among intravenous drug users . In rare cases, HIV transmission can happen in other situations as well . These include: 1 2 Pregnancy . HIV can be transmitted from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy, birth, or by breastfeeding. HIV-positive women can reduce the risk of HIV transmission to their child to less than 1% by taking antiretroviral medication and by considering other feeding options apart from breastfeeding. Having oral sex with someone who is HIV positive . This risk is negligible, but transmission may happen when an HIV-positive man ejaculates into his partner’s mouth or when there are wounds or ulcers present in the mouth or on the genitalia. Receiving a blood transfusion or transplant . This risk is also minimal as all donated blood and organs in the USA are checked profoundly for HIV. Being bitten by a person with HIV if the bite goes through your skin. Tongue kissing if both partners have open wounds in the mouth.",
    "can_you_get_hiv_from_saliva": "There are no other ways of contracting HIV apart from the bodily fluids mentioned above. This means that HIV can not be transmitted by : 1 3 Saliva, tears, sweat, feces, or urine Air or water Bites of insects such as mosquitoes or ticks Physical touch and sharing dishes Closed-mouth kissing However, HIV can be transmitted in some of these situations if there are wounds on the skin which allow contact with the blood of an HIV-positive person. If there are no open wounds, then there’s also no risk, as HIV can not be transmitted through unbroken skin.",
    "how_do_you_get_aids": "AIDS itself cannot be transmitted, as it’s a consequence of HIV . AIDS stands for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome , which is the late stage of HIV infection . In this stage, the human immunodeficiency virus will have caused a lot of damage to the immune system. This weakens the immune system, which leads to the development of opportunistic infections. These are infections caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites which would not usually appear in people with healthy immune systems. 1 With the correct treatment, HIV does not progress to AIDS, enabling people to live a long and healthy life.",
    "wrapping_up": "HIV transmission can happen through several bodily fluids, being blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, anal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. These fluids can be interchanged during sexual activity or by sharing needles and syringes. If you think that you may be at risk of HIV, then it’s crucial to speak to your healthcare provider about getting tested.

    "hiv_transmissionfaqs": "Q: How do you get HIV? A: You can get HIV by having sex with an HIV-positive person or by sharing needles. There are also other, more rare ways of contracting HIV, such as oral sex, blood transfusions, and transplants. During pregnancy, an HIV-positive mother can also infect her child, although, with the proper treatment, this possibility is less than 1%. Q: How do people get AIDS, A: People can get AIDS as a result of an untreated HIV infection. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV, in which the immune system is severely damaged. This can lead to opportunistic infections. Q: Can you get HIV from kissing? A: You can not get HIV from kissing, as HIV is not transmittable through saliva. There’s, however, a rare possibility to get HIV if both partners have open wounds in the mouth and are tongue kissing, as this means that there could be an exchange of blood. Q: How likely are you to transmit HIV? A: The risk of transmitting HIV depends on the kind of activity and the viral load of the infected person. The risk is highest for anal-receptive sex."

    "what_is_human_herpesvirus": "The human herpesvirus (HHV) belongs to the herpesvirus family, which is a group of viruses that can infect both animals and humans. Over 130 species of herpesvirus are known, but only eight of these are known to infect humans. These, collectively, are known as human herpesvirus, or HHV. The herpesvirus family are DNA viruses, which means that they have DNA rather than RNA as their genetic material (the HIV virus, for example, is an RNA virus). Other DNA viruses that affect humans are adenoviruses, different types of which can cause the common cold , conjunctivitis and bronchitis , as well as human papillomaviruses, various strains of which can cause warts , genital warts , cervical cancer , and anal cancer .  It is important to note that, although these are all DNA viruses, they are not otherwise related to one another. Human herpesviruses are contagious, which means that they are passed from person to person. Because they do not live for long outside the human body, they are usually passed on by direct contact with bodily fluids rather than infected objects. Human herpesviruses can be passed on by: 1 Respiratory secretions, such as phlegm from a cough or water droplets from a sneeze Saliva Sexual intercourse Direct skin contact with a rash caused by an HHV infection. Newborn babies can be infected in the womb or during birth. The human herpesvirus family is the source of many common diseases, including chickenpox, shingles, mononucleosis, cold sores, and genital herpes. Infections caused by human herpesvirus tend to remain latent, which means they stay in the host even after the primary infection has resolved and can reactivate later.",
    "viruses_in_the_human_herpesvirus_family": "Only eight members of the herpesvirus are known to infect humans , which is why they are known as human herpesviruses. 2 Some of these viruses have more than one name. The eight herpesviruses that infect humans are: 2 Human Herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1), also known as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) Human Herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2), also known as Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) Human Herpesvirus 3 (HHV-3), also known as Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) Human Herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), also known as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Human Herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), also known as Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi’s Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) Because referring to these viruses can become confusing due to the similarity of the names, this document will use the alternative names. For example, human herpesvirus 1 will be called herpes simplex virus 1 or HSV-1, and human herpesvirus 4 will be called Epstein-Barr Virus or EBV.",
    "hhv_1_and_hhv_2_herpes_simplex_virus_hhv_2": "Human Herpes Virus 1 and 2 are also known as Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2. They are extremely common, with HSV-1 being present in 90 percent of adults and HSV-2 being present in between 10 and 30 percent of adults.  HSV-1 is usually associated with herpes labialis but can sometimes cause genital herpes, while HSV-2 is usually associated only with genital herpes. Most people are infected with HSV-1 during early childhood, and symptoms are mild; some children may not show any symptoms at all.  HSV-1 is spread by saliva and/or respiratory secretions, but HSV-2 is almost always spread by genital contact. People usually contract HSV-2 later in life than they contract HSV-1. However, in the U.S.A., Europe, and some parts of the western Pacific, it is becoming more common to contract HSV-1 for the first time during sexual activity as a teenager or adult, which is leading to an increase in the number of cases of genital herpes caused by HSV-1. 3 Read more about Herpes Simplex »\n\nHerpes labialis, also known as oral herpes, cold sores or fever blisters, is caused by HSV-1. It is characterized by recurrent outbreaks of painful blisters on the lips and is highly contagious. People with an active outbreak of herpes labialis, i.e who have an active cold sore, should avoid kissing or oral sex. Stress, illness or weather conditions may trigger the appearance of cold sores. Herpes labialis is not usually very serious, although people with weak immune systems are more at risk of complications. Read more about Herpes Labialis »\n\nGenital herpes is characterized by itchy painful blisters on the genitals and in the genital region. It is usually caused by HSV-2 and is almost always sexually transmitted. For this reason, anyone with an active blister caused by genital herpes should refrain from sexual activity until the blister has healed. Like cold sores, outbreaks of genital herpes can be triggered by stress, illness or weather conditions. Read more about Genital Herpes » .\n\nMost babies who are born to mothers who have HSV-1 or HSV-2 are not at all affected by it, but if the mother contracts HSV for the first time during the third trimester of pregnancy , the chances of the baby experiencing complications are increased. HSV infection in very young babies or newborns is known as neonatal herpes. The majority of cases of neonatal herpes happen when the baby is exposed to the virus in the birth canal during delivery. 4 The affected baby usually begins to show symptoms during the first month of life. There are three main subcategories of neonatal herpes: 4 Skin infection, in which a rash forms on the skin and around the eyes and mouth Encephalitis, inflammation of the brain which can cause problems such as seizures Disseminated infection, in which the virus spreads throughout the body and affects various organs Symptoms of neonatal herpes include: 4 Fever Irritability Lethargy Loss of appetite or unwillingness to feed Blisters anywhere on the body, including the eyes and mouth Difficulty breathing, such as grunting, rapid breathing, irregular breathing or a bluish appearance Jaundice Bleeding. Neonatal herpes is rare but is considered an emergency, and medical attention should be sought as soon as symptoms appear.",
    "hhv_3_varicella_zoster_virus": "The varicella zoster virus , also known as VZV, herpes zoster and sometimes simply as zoster, causes the common childhood disease chickenpox, when it infects a person for the first time and, when reactivated later in life, causes the painful skin condition known as shingles.\n\nAlthough chickenpox is a common disease, its incidence is falling due to effective widespread vaccination campaigns in most developed countries. Nevertheless, it is a common childhood condition, with outbreaks periodically happening at kindergartens and elementary schools. It is also common for the siblings, parents or caregivers of an affected child to contract the virus, especially if they have not been vaccinated. The condition tends to be more severe among teenagers and adults, but relatively mild in children. The most distinctive symptom of chickenpox is an itchy, blister-like rash. Other symptoms include fever, headache and body aches, which often appear before the rash develops. The outlook in cases of chickenpox is usually good, and most people recover without particular treatment. Complications can develop, but these are not common. Potential complications include pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections, and, more rarely, encephalitis. Read more about Varicella Zoster (Chickenpox) »\n\nAfter the primary varicella zoster infection has resolved, the varicella virus remains dormant in the body for life. It can be reactivated later in life by stress or illness. Older adults and those with weakened immune systems may be more at risk of developing shingles. When the virus reactivates, it travels up the nerve in which it has lain dormant to the surface of the skin, causing painful lesions. These are usually restricted to an area of the skin served by a particular nerve, known as a dermatome, leading to a characteristic stripe pattern of lesions. Read more about the Signs of Shingles » Shingles is very uncomfortable and may become complicated if it affects the ears or eyes , or if a secondary bacterial infection affects the lesions and leads to a skin infection. Shingles is treated with antiviral medications and pain management medications, and most people recover well within two weeks. Some, however, experience ongoing pain and discomfort in the affected area; this is known as post-herpetic neuralgia. Read more about Shingles »",
    "hhv_4_epstein_barr_virus": "It is estimated that about 90% of the world’s entire population carries the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Most people contract the virus in childhood, when symptoms of infection are mild and often go unnoticed. The Epstein-Barr virus remains in the body for life. Periodically, people with EBV shed the virus in their bodily fluids and tissues. When this happens, people who come into contact with their saliva or respiratory droplets may contract the virus. It is possible to have EBV and not know it.\n\nAlthough most people who contract EBV remain asymptomatic for life, some may develop a condition known as infectious mononucleosis, which is also called glandular fever or simply mono. This is more common in people who encounter EBV for the first time during adolescence or early adulthood. The main features of this condition are fatigue and a severe sore throat. The fatigue associated with infectious mononucleosis can last up to six months in extreme cases, but usually resolves after three months. Most people recover well, but complications can develop. These include encephalitis, a ruptured spleen and extremely enlarged tonsils.",
    "hhv_5_cytomegalovirus": "Cytomegalovirus, like other members of the human herpesvirus family, is commonly found worldwide. In most people, the virus lies dormant in the body once the original infection has cleared up and can be reactivated by stress or illness.\n\nInfection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is extremely common, and it is estimated that between 60 and 90 percent of all adults have had CMV at some time in their lives. Usually, the virus is contracted during childhood, though it is also possible to be infected for the first time as an adult. 5 In adolescents and adults, CMV infection may cause CMV mononucleosis, which is similar to EBV mononucleosis. In healthy people, CMV infection is often asymptomatic or has only mild, non-specific symptoms such as fever, malaise and swollen lymph glands. Most people who have CMV will have no ill-effects, but people with weakened immune systems may experience serious complications. Likewise, babies born to mothers who are infected with CMV for the first time during pregnancy may develop congenital cytomegalovirus infection, 6 which can be very serious.

    "hhv_6": "Human herpesvirus 6 is quite commonly found in the human population, affecting between 25 and 95 percent of many populations. Most people contract HHV-6 by the age of three years, 7 and in the majority of cases, the infection is asymptomatic. 8 By far the most common strain of HHV-6 is HHV-6B, which is implicated in the vast majority of all HHV-6 infections, including the common childhood condition roseola infantum. HHV-6A is much less common and is usually found in people with weakened immune systems, ref12 for example, people affected by HIV infection or chemotherapy . HHV-6 is spread from person to person by contact with respiratory secretions from coughing or sneezing. 9 Like all strains of human herpesvirus, HHV-6 causes a primary infection, such as roseola infantum, and then stays latent in the body, where it can be reactivated by stress or other illness. 7 In some adults who experience a primary infection of HHV-6, a mononucleosis-like condition can develop. 8 It is much more common for HHV-6 reactivation to happen in people with weakened immune systems than those with normal immune systems. 8 When the virus reacts, it can affect any organ, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. If the brain is involved, complications such as otitis media , hepatitis, and encephalitis may occur. ref12 In most cases, HHV-6 infection is an uncomplicated condition that clears up on its own. 8 Laboratory tests are not usually needed to diagnose a primary infection, but are sometimes used to identify HHV-6 reactivation in people with weakened immune systems. ref12 There is no specific treatment for HHV-6 infection, but some evidence shows that antivirals such as ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet may be useful in some cases. 7 Antivirals should be used in cases of HHV-6 primary infection or reactivation in people with compromised immune systems.\n\nRoseola infantum is a common childhood condition caused by infection with HHV-6, which causes high fever, irritability, loss of appetite, and a rash. It is most common in children between the ages of six months and two years, but it can affect adults, though symptoms tend to be mild in both cases. It is the primary infection caused by human herpesvirus 6, in the same way that chickenpox is the primary infection of HHV-3, the chickenpox virus. HHV-7 can also sometimes cause roseola infantum. A common complication of roseola infantum is febrile seizures ,** which can sometimes require hospitalization but are usually passing and not an indication of epilepsy. It is rare for an adult or a child to have roseola more than once, but this can happen if the affected person is immunosuppressed. Read more about Roseola Infantum »",
    "hhv_7": "HHV-7, like HHV-6, affects upwards of 90 percent of all adults worldwide. 10 Infection with HHV-7 usually occurs in childhood or infancy, 11 and is usually asymptomatic. The conditions caused by this human herpesvirus are generally less well-understood overall than those caused by some of the other strains of the virus. In children, primary infection with HHV-7 can cause a fever, on its own or in combination with other symptoms in a condition that resembles roseola infantum. While HHV-7 is less likely to reactivate than some other human herpesviruses, it can reactivate in people with weakened immune systems, especially among people who have recently received organ transplants. 10 Infections caused by HHV-7 are not generally very serious in people with healthy immune systems 11",
    "hhv_8_kaposi_s_sarcoma_herpesvirus": "HHV-8, also known as KSHV, or Kaposi’s Sarcoma Herpesvirus, is not as common as the other strains of HHV discussed here. In the U.S., it is estimated that less than five percent of the total population carry HHV-8, with most cases concentrated among men who have sex with men and intravenous drug users. However, HHV-8 is much more common in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is not necessarily associated with drug use or men who have sex with men. In sub-Saharan Africa, most people with HHV-8 contract the virus during childhood, 12 with some regions reporting prevalences of between 30 and 80 percent. 13 HHV-8 is spread by contact with respiratory droplets and nasal secretions, ref17 14 and may be sexually transmitted. Most people who contract HHV-8 do not show symptoms, 14 but some young children and immunocompetent adults may develop symptoms such as: 12 13 Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Immunosuppressed people who contract HHV-8 may experience the symptoms listed above, as well as enlarged lymph glands, enlarged spleen and a blood disorder known as pancytopenia. This last is a condition in which levels of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets all drop, 12 leading to fatigue, anemia, bruising and a weakened immune system. In some cases, they may also experience bone marrow failure and/or develop Kaposi’s sarcoma. HHV-8 has also been linked to: 12 Primary effusion lymphoma, a type of lymphoma that develops in body cavities Multicentric Castleman disease, a condition in which non-cancerous tumors develop in one or more lymph nodes In most cases, the condition most often associated with HHV-8 infection is Kaposi’s sarcoma."

    "what_is_hpv": "HPV stands for human papillomavirus, and is a term to describe a group of viruses that affect the skin. It’s a very common virus that gets transmitted easily. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, but in some cases, it may have serious consequences for your health. These consequences depend on the genetic variant (also called a strain) of HPV you’ve been infected with. While some strains clear on their own, others may cause genital warts or cancers. 1",
    "how_is_hpv_transmitted": "HPV is considered an STD , as it is transmitted through sexual contact. You can get HPV by: 1 2 Having unprotected vaginal or anal sex Having oral sex Sharing sex toys Having skin-to-skin contact with the genital area of an infected person. Someone may have HPV without showing any symptoms. Even with a lack of symptoms, the virus can still be passed along through skin-to-skin contact with the genitalia. Condoms do offer some protection, although they can’t assure full protection as they don’t cover all the genital skin. 2",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Not everyone with an HPV infection will show HPV symptoms. In about 90% of all cases, the virus won’t cause any trouble and it will even go away on its own within two years with the help of your own immune system. However, a small percentage of people can suffer from various health problems caused by this virus, such as genital warts and cancer. 3 HPV warts can vary in shape and size, but are usually shaped like a cauliflower. They can be flat, but may also appear as a raised spot on the skin, which is why some people may confuse the warts caused by HPV with pimples. As there are many different ways for genital warts to appear, it’s advised to have a check-up with your doctor if you’ve noticed any lumps or growths that are new in your genital area. 1 3 Besides genital warts, HPV can also cause cancer in the genital area. There may be years between the infection and the actual development of a cancer. It’s hard to predict who might possibly suffer from health problems caused by HPV, but in general it’s said that people who have a weakened immune system (such as people with an HIV infection ) are more prone to develop cancers due to HPV. Cancers caused by this virus may include: 3 4 Cervical cancer Cancer of the vulva or the vagina Cancer of the anus Another consequence that can be caused by HPV is throat cancer, also called oropharyngeal cancer. The presence of HPV in the mouth and throat caused by oral sex can cause this cancer to develop years after being infected with the virus. Whether or not you’ll develop throat cancer after having oral HPV probably depends on other factors as well, such as the strength of the immune system, your alcohol consumption, or smoking habits. Cancers in the throat which are caused by HPV can affect the tonsils, the throat or the base of the tongue. 3 4 Some strains of HPV are more likely to cause symptoms in the mouth. Besides cancers, this can also be under the form of HPV bumps on the lips or HPV bumps on the tongue. 5 There has also been a link found between HPV and pregnancy issues . Pregnant women are often more prone to infections as their immune system temporarily changes throughout their pregnancy. Getting infected with HPV during pregnancy may result in a number of consequences such as preterm birth, miscarriage, and low birth weight. 6",
    "what_does_hpv_look_like_on_a_man": "HPV in men is transmitted the same way as it is in women. Men usually don’t have any symptoms when they are infected with HPV, and the infection usually goes away by itself. If HPV does cause symptoms, then these findings will be visible on the penis, scrotum, anus, mouth, or throat. The symptoms may include: 7 HPV Warts Lumps Sores Growths It may be that there’s only one wart visible, or they can occur in a group, which is when people often talk about a HPV rash. HPV may also cause cancers of the penis, the anus and the throat in men. However it’s not common for these cancers to develop after a HPV infection. Men who receive anal sex and men with weakened immune systems may be more prone to develop cancers caused by the virus. 7",
    "what_is_the_hpv_vaccine": "The HPV vaccine was created to prevent complications of HPV infections. It’s especially targeted at avoiding cervical and oropharyngeal cancers, although it may also help to prevent genital warts . 8 The usual HPV vaccine schedule starts with a first dose at age 9-12, and a second dose 6-12 months after the first dose. For those who are vaccinated after turning 15, a third dose should be given as well. Both men and women up until 26 are advised to get vaccinated, although it’s best to start the vaccine schedule before becoming sexually active, to avoid coming into contact with the virus before being vaccinated. After 26, it’s not recommended for everyone to get vaccinated. A healthcare specialist can provide you with more information on vaccination for your personal situation. 8",
    "what_are_hpv_vaccine_side_effects": "Although the HPV vaccine is proven to be very safe and has already been monitored for over 15 years, there are some possible mild side effects that can occur after vaccination: 8 Pain, swelling, or redness where the injection was administered, Dizziness or fainting, Nausea, Headaches These side effects are common for all vaccines and are of short duration.",
    "how_to_prevent_an_hpv_infection": "HPV infections can be prevented in a number of ways: 7 By getting vaccinated. The vaccine is recommended for pre-teens and can still be administered until 26 years old. It’s ideal to get vaccinated before becoming sexually active, so that you haven’t been exposed to the virus yet. By using condoms or dental dams when having sex. Although these precautions are effective and help protect you against other STDs such as chlamydia , gonorrhea , syphilis and trichomoniasis as well, they don’t completely rule out the possibility of getting infected as HPV can be present on the skin around the genitalia that isn’t covered by the condom. By limiting your number of sexual partners or by practising abstinence. Screening for HPV infections is an important strategy to prevent cervical cancer. This is because women with persistent HPV infections or a compromised immune system due to conditions such as HIV are more likely to develop cervical cancer. Early intervention could therefore help you protect yourself against progression to pre-cancer and cancer. There are two different tests that can be done at your healthcare provider: 9 10 A Pap smear test, which looks for changes in the cells of the cervix. These changed cells might grow out to be cervical cancer if they aren’t treated appropriately A HPV test, which looks for the human papillomavirus in the cells. The CDC recommends that you start getting screened at age 21 with a pap smear test. You should repeat this process every 3 to 5 years, depending on the advice of your doctor. If you’re older than 65, your doctor may tell you that you don’t need to get screened anymore if you’ve never had anything unusual in your test results or if you’ve had your cervix removed. 10",
    "hpv_faqs": "Q: Can you get HPV without having sex? A: Yes, you can also get HPV from skin-to-skin contact of the genital area. Q: Do I automatically get HPV if my partner has it? A: It’s very likely that partners share HPV, as the virus can get transmitted very easily and is not visible in most cases. Q: Is HPV herpes? A: Although both herpes and HPV are STDs that may cause skin lesions that look alike, they are both different viruses with different characteristics. Q: How to get rid of HPV? A: The immune system usually clears HPV 1-2 years after being infected. There is no treatment for HPV itself, although it is possible to treat the consequences of the virus. Q: How often do HPV warts recur? A: Genital warts may come back regularly after treatment. How often they do come back isn’t clear, but they may come back more in people with a weakened immune system. Q: Does HPV go away? A: The vast majority of cases clear within 1-2 years after infection. Q: How long can HPV be dormant? A: HPV can be dormant for years before causing problems like genital warts or cancers."

    "what_is_hypertensive_retinopathy": "Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) is a possible complication of high blood pressure (hypertension). Persistent, untreated high blood pressure can cause damage to the retina, the tissues at the back of the eye responsible for receiving the images we need to see. The condition can lead to symptoms including double or dim vision, loss of vision and headaches. Treating hypertensive retinopathy typically involves controlling high blood pressure through lifestyle changes, medication and careful monitoring. Through this, the condition can be halted, and the damage may slowly heal.",
    "causes": "Hypertensive retinopathy is an eyesight disorder that occurs as a result of high blood pressure . High blood pressure, also called hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls is too high, causing the arteries to stretch, narrow and become damaged over time. Hypertensive retinopathy occurs when the blood vessels supplying blood to the retina in the back of the eye become damaged. The likelihood of damage to the retina increases with the severity of high blood pressure and the length of time over which the condition is experienced. 1 Older people are most at risk of developing high blood pressure and are therefore also most at risk of developing hypertensive retinopathy. Other factors that may contribute to the likelihood of developing high blood pressure include: 2 Being overweight A sedentary lifestyle A diet high in salt Stress A family history of high blood pressure Diabetes Moderate to high alcohol intake",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Most people will only develop symptoms of hypertensive retinopathy after there has already been significant damage to the retina. Before this, it may take a doctor or ophthalmologist (specialist eye doctor) to identify the condition. Symptoms may include: Double or cloudy vision Headaches Loss of vision, when the condition has progressed significantly If these symptoms come on very quickly, this can be a sign of severely high blood pressure and should be considered a medical emergency. Call a doctor immediately.",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_stages": "Ophthalmologists grade hypertensive retinopathy using four categories or stages. The classification system is known as the Keith Wagener Barker (KWB) grades. 2 1 Grade 1: High blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries is mild. Generally, no symptoms are present. Grade 2: High blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries is more pronounced. Generally, no symptoms are present. Grade 3: Signs of damage such as retinal haemorrhage (bleeding) and cotton wool spots, i.e. white patches on the retina, are present upon inspection. Symptoms may be present. Grade 4: Severe Grade 3 plus swelling of the optic disc (papilledema). Symptoms are present. Some medical professionals may prefer to use the Mitchell-Wong grading system; a simplified version of the Keith Wagener Barker grades. This system simply combines the first two categories into one.",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_diagnosis": "Diagnosing hypertensive retinopathy typically involves an examination by an ophthalmologist based on the symptoms present. In some cases, an ophthalmoscope may be used to investigate the retina in the back of the eye. This instrument shines light into the eye, allowing doctors to see any signs of damage. More rarely, a test known as a fluorescein angiography may be performed to investigate the blood flow into the retina. This involves taking pictures of the eye before and after a special fluorescein dye has been injected into the system and passed through the blood vessels of the eye. 2",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_treatment": "The only way to treat hypertensive retinopathy is by controlling high blood pressure. This can be done through lifestyle changes such as: Giving up smoking Losing weight Taking regular exercise Dietary changes Reducing alcohol intake Medication, such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-2 receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel-blockers and beta-blockers may also be prescribed to help lower blood pressure levels. These medications can help to allow the retina to heal and stop further damage from occurring. The type of medication chosen will depend on the affected person’s medical history and a consideration of the possible side-effects.",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_prevention": "Preventing hypertensive retinopathy is possible through careful management of high blood pressure and related conditions, such as diabetes. Lifestyle changes, such as losing weight or giving up smoking, may be useful in achieving this. People with high blood pressure should also have their blood pressure regularly tested and be screened for eye problems.",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_complications": "Individuals with hypertensive retinopathy are at risk of various complications, including: Retinal vein occlusion occurs when a vein in the retina becomes blocked due to clots. Retinal artery occlusion occurs when an artery in the retina becomes blocked due to clots, resulting in possible loss of vision. Ischemic optic neuropathy involves the normal blood flow to the eye being blocked, resulting in damage to the optic nerve, the part of the eye which transmits images to the brain. Malignant hypertension causes blood pressure to increase rapidly, causing possible loss of vision. This is a rare complication, which is potentially life-threatening. Hypertensive retinopathy is also linked to an increased risk of stroke and heart attack .",
    "prognosis": "The outlook for people with mild (grade 1 or 2) hypertensive retinopathy is relatively positive, so long as blood pressure levels are controlled. If, however, severe hypertensive retinopathy is not properly managed, the condition can enter a “malignant” stage, which is associated with a relatively poor prognosis. 3",
    "other_names_for_hypertensive_retinopathy": "Fundus hypertonicus",
    "hypertensive_retinopathy_faqs": "Q: Can hypertensive retinopathy be reversed? A: It depends on the extent of damage to the retina. In many cases, the damage caused by hypertensive retinopathy can slowly heal if the necessary steps to lower one’s blood pressure are taken. These steps may include making lifestyle changes such as giving up smoking and losing weight, as well as taking medication as prescribed by a doctor. Q: What is the difference between hypertensive retinopathy and diabetic retinopathy? A: Hypertensive retinopathy is caused by high blood pressure. While having high blood pressure can increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy, this condition is a complication of diabetes, meaning anyone with diabetes type 1 or type 2 can potentially develop the condition . Like hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy causes damage to the retina at the back of the eye and can, if left untreated, lead to blindness. 4 Q: Can high blood pressure cause double vision? A: Yes, double vision can, in some cases, be a symptom of high blood pressure, specifically when high blood pressure has led to hypertensive retinopathy. If this symptom occurs very suddenly, a doctor should be contacted urgently."

    "what_is_hyperthyroidism": "Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive, or hyperactive, and causes an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the lower part of the neck, below the voice box. Hormones released by the thyroid regulate the body’s metabolism, affecting functions such as heart rate, digestion and temperature. 2 Having too much thyroid hormone, a state which is called thyrotoxicosis, can cause symptoms like difficulty sleeping, nervousness, rapid heartbeat, intolerance to heat and weight loss despite a healthy appetite. 2 Hyperthyroidism can affect anyone, of any age, though it seems to be more prevalent among women and older adults. It is not a very common condition. 3 Hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and causes a lack of thyroid hormone, is more common. 4 Sometimes, a period of hyperthyroidism can occur as part of thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid gland, and follow or be followed by hypothyroidism. If you think that you might have a thyroid condition, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Hyperthyroidism may have a number of different causes. The most common is Graves' disease, also known as diffuse toxic goiter or Basedow’s disease , an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid to produce too much thyroid hormone. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroiditis, thyroid nodules and, rarely, certain medications and tumors. 2 3 If left untreated for a long period of time, hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications, including heart problems. 5 However, hyperthyroidism is relatively easy to diagnose with blood tests, and effective treatment options are available. These include medication, radioactive iodine therapy and, in some cases, surgery. 2 3",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Symptoms of excess thyroid hormone may include: 2 3 6 7 8 9 10\n\nAnxiety or nervousness; some people may present with signs of depression Irritability or agitation Insomnia (sleep disturbances)\n\nIncreased sweating Intolerance of heat, e.g. hot weather Fatigue, i.e. generally feeling tired or weak Tremors (shaky hands) Feeling of weakness in the muscles, particularly in the upper arms and thighs Difficulty exercising Swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter)\n\nRacing heart or palpitations, i.e. pronounced awareness of one’s heartbeat High blood pressure Shortness of breath\n\nWeight loss or difficulty gaining weight, in spite of a good or even increased appetite Increased frequency of bowel movements Nausea and vomiting\n\nItchy skin Thinning of the hair Eye bulging and irritation (Graves' ophthalmopathy, or thyroid eye disease) Rarely, reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on the shins or tops of the feet (Graves’ dermopathy or pretibial myxedema) 11\n\nReduced libido (sex drive) Infrequent, light or no menstruation in women Erectile dysfunction in men Though not common, some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism. Some people may find that their appetite decreases. If you think that you may have signs of hyperthyroidism, you can try using the Ada app for a free assessment.",
    "hyperthyroidism_causes": "Hyperthyroidism has a number of possible causes, including the following: 2 3 5 10\n\nAlso called Basedow’s disease or diffuse toxic goiter, this is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly stimulates the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. Graves' disease often runs in families and mainly affects young adult women, though it can occur in anyone, of any age.\n\nA thyroid nodule is a small lump that develops in the thyroid gland. Sometimes, thyroid nodules cause the production of too much thyroid hormone; these are termed hot or toxic nodules. A single nodule is called toxic solitary adenoma and is typically found in people between 30 and 50 years of age. If several nodules are present, it is called toxic multinodular goiter or Plummer disease – this is most commonly found in older adults. Nodules are made up of abnormal thyroid tissue, but they are not usually cancerous.\n\nTransient hyperthyroidism can also develop as a result of inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), which may be part of various disorders, including De Quervain’s thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis. Read more about Thyroiditis »\n\nThough unusual, hyperthyroidism can also be caused by certain medications, including amiodarone and lithium. Taking too many iodine supplements or over-the-counter formulations that contain thyroid hormones can also lead to hyperthyroidism in some cases. If a person is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and the dose is too high, this too can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\n\nA very small number of pregnant women may develop hyperthyroidism from hyperemesis gravidarum – a condition that causes severe nausea and vomiting during the first few months of pregnancy. 12 Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by cancer in the thyroid gland or certain types of tumors. It can also occur, for a short period of time, after exposure to radiation, for example following treatment with radioiodine or radiotherapy.",
    "diagnosis": "After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically order blood tests to check thyroid hormone levels.\n\nThese tests typically measure: 13 TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) FT4 (free thyroxine) FT3 (free triiodothyronine) – only occasionally TSH levels vary according to the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that is needed. T4 is converted into T3 (triiodothyronine), the biologically active form of thyroid hormone. In hyperthyroidism, where there is an excess of thyroxine in the body, the level of TSH is usually low and the FT4 and FT3 high. 14 If blood tests show normal levels of FT4 and FT3, but low TSH, a diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism may be made and follow-up tests ordered for approximately two months’ time. In some cases, treatment may be recommended for persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism, particularly in older adults, as the condition may lead to complications. 10 If the doctor suspects that Graves' disease may be present, they will usually also order blood tests to check for thyroid antibodies that are often seen in the disorder. If another cause is suspected, further blood tests may be necessary. 3 13\n\nIn some cases, an ultrasound scan of the thyroid or a radioactive iodine uptake test with or without a procedure called a thyroid scan, may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and cause of hyperthyroidism. 3 These imaging tests can detect thyroid nodules and inflammation, and provide insight into how the thyroid gland is functioning.\n\nThis is a quick and simple scan that uses sound waves to create an image of the thyroid gland. No radioactive substances are involved. 15\n\nThese tests require the administering of a small amount of a weak radioactive substance, which temporarily collects in the thyroid. Imaging is performed a number of hours later, either using a device called a gamma probe, or a radioactive iodine tracer in the case of a thyroid scan procedure. 16 17 18 19\n\nA doctor will need to rule out other conditions that can cause some of the same symptoms as hyperthyroidism, such as anxiety and panic disorder , diabetes , heart disease and drug abuse.",
    "hyperthyroidism_treatment": "If a person is diagnosed with hyperthyroidism they will usually be referred to an endocrinologist, a doctor specializing in the body’s hormones and hormonal conditions, for treatment. 10 The aims of treatment are to bring the levels of thyroid hormone into the acceptable range and manage any complications that may have arisen as a result of hyperthyroidism. 3 There are a number of different treatment options. When advising which is most appropriate for a particular person, their age, general health, personal preferences and the cause of hyperthyroidism will be taken into account by the doctor. Treatment may include the following: 2 3 10 14\n\nA doctor may prescribe antithyroid medication to reduce the production of thyroid hormone. This is typically methimazole or carbimazole, or propylthiouracil if a person is in their first trimester of pregnancy. It may take a few weeks for thyroid hormone levels to stabilize, during which time beta-blockers or calcium-channel blockers may be recommended to alleviate hyperthyroidism symptoms like anxiety, palpitations and tremors. The medication typically needs to be taken every day for a year to a year and a half. In some cases, it may then be possible to stop taking the antithyroid medication. However, some people will need to stay on it for life or consider another long-term treatment option. A doctor will be able to advise on how long to take antithyroid medication, as well as precautions that need to be taken while on it. Antithyroid medication is typically not recommended for cases of transient hyperthyroidism caused by thyroiditis, as these tend to resolve on their own.\n\nIn many cases of hyperthyroidism, radioactive iodine (radioiodine) therapy, also known as radioactive iodine ablation, may be recommended. A medical specialist will administer a single dose of radioactive iodine, typically in the form of a capsule or liquid. This iodine accumulates in the thyroid, gradually destroying thyroid tissue and decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. It may take a few months to see results. If the therapy results in a complete, permanent lack of thyroid hormone production, which is often a desired outcome in the treatment of Graves' disease, it will be necessary to take synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, daily, to prevent the development of hypothyroidism. This is known as block-and-replace treatment. It may be necessary to undergo short-term treatment with antithyroid medication prior to radioiodine therapy, particularly where symptoms are severe, the person is older or they have a heart condition. This treatment is typically stopped approximately a week before the radioiodine therapy is performed. Another short course of medication may be necessary after the procedure. Radioiodine therapy is generally considered to be a safe and effective procedure that does not cause problems in the body. As a precaution, however, it is recommended that the person avoid prolonged close contact with others for a while after the treatment. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy and children under five years of age are not eligible for radioiodine therapy. Anyone planning to have a child is advised to wait for a certain period of time before trying to conceive afterwards. A doctor will be able to explain all necessary precautions in detail.\n\nIn some cases, doctors may recommend an operation to remove part or all of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy). However, this is usually reserved for cases of hyperthyroidism where other types of treatment have been unsuccessful or intolerable, or a very large goiter (swelling of the gland) is causing problems, such as difficulty breathing. A thyroidectomy is considered to be effective and safe. However, as with any type of surgery, there is a small risk of complications. Before having surgery, a person will typically be prescribed a course of antithyroid medication to minimize the risk of complications like thyroid storm (see below). Depending on the amount of tissue that is removed, it will often be necessary to take synthetic thyroid hormone, levothyroxine, daily, to prevent the development of hypothyroidism.\n\nRegardless of the type of treatment a person receives, they will need to go for regular checkups afterwards. These will typically include blood tests to check that thyroid hormone levels are within range. People with Graves' disease may experience periods of remission and relapse of hyperthyroidism. It is important to monitor for symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as well as hypothyroidism , such as sensitivity to cold, dry skin, fatigue and unexplained weight gain, and consult a doctor should any develop.\n\nWhile a number of over-the-counter products may claim to treat hyperthyroidism, there are currently no recognized natural remedies for the condition. If a person has symptoms of hyperthyroidism, it is important that they consult a medical doctor without delay.",
    "complications": "If left untreated, or inadequately treated, hyperthyroidism can lead to a number of complications. These include: 3 10\n\nA small number of people with hyperthyroidism develop related eye problems, termed thyroid eye disease. Because this is most commonly associated with Graves' disease, it is often called Graves' ophthalmopathy. The eyes become inflamed and swollen, leading to pain and discomfort, and vision may be affected. Thyroid eye disease ranges from mild to severe, with treatment correspondingly differing from eye drops to medication and surgery. A person with thyroid eye disease will typically be referred to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for optimal management of the condition. 21 22\n\nRarely, a person with hyperthyroidism may develop a life-threatening condition, known as thyroid storm or thyrotoxic crisis. During thyroid storm, thyroid hormone levels become extremely high, resulting in a medical emergency. Signs and symptoms of thyroid storm include: Significantly elevated temperature Profuse sweating Very fast heartbeat High blood pressure Severe nausea Vomiting Diarrhea Severe mental agitation and anxiety Delirium or psychosis Seizures The person may develop atrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) and heart failure or enter a comatose state. While there is sometimes no obvious trigger, thyroid storm is more likely to develop after the discontinuation of antithyroid medication, treatment with radioiodine, a severe infection or surgery. A person experiencing thyroid storm requires urgent hospital care, which typically includes an intravenous drip, beta-blockers, antithyroid medication and other treatments.\n\nA person may also develop the following as a result of hyperthyroidism: Increased risk of heart problems, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure Increased risk of bone weakness, also known as osteoporosis Increased risk of complications during pregnancy, such as miscarriage With effective medical management of hyperthyroidism, the risk of complications is minimized.",
    "hyperthyroidism_and_pregnancy": "Hyperthyroidism is not common in pregnancy . However, if it does occur and is not managed properly, the condition can cause serious complications for both mother and baby. 23",
    "hyperthyroidism_and_children": "Hyperthyroidism can affect people of any age, though it is less common in children than adults. Most cases of hyperthyroidism in children are caused by Graves’ disease, and it is more prevalent among girls than boys. 10 24 Symptoms of hyperthyroidism in children may develop slowly, but typically include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, behavioral changes and intolerance of hot conditions. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can affect a child’s growth and development. 10 24 Treatment options are largely the same as for adults, though antithyroid medication is preferred. 10 14\n\nA very small number of newborn babies may present with hyperthyroidism, typically where the mother has Graves' disease. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism in infants may include irritability, restlessness, rapid heartbeat, lack of weight gain and goiter. The hyperthyroidism usually clears up within a few months, but it may be necessary for the baby to be treated with antithyroid medication in the interim, to avoid complications. 10",

A: Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is overactive, causing an excess of thyroid hormone in the body. Symptoms may include increased heart rate, weight loss and anxiety. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is underactive, causing a deficiency of thyroid hormone in the body. Symptoms may include tiredness, weight gain and depression. Read more about Hypothyroidism » Q: What is the best diet for hyperthyroidism? A: No specific diet is recommended for people with hyperthyroidism. Generally speaking, a balanced, healthy diet is considered to be sufficient. It is not advisable to adopt a special diet or take nutritional supplements without first consulting a doctor. It is especially important that kelp and iodine supplements be avoided unless recommended by a doctor, as they can worsen hyperthyroidism. 25 Q: Can hyperthyroidism cause weight gain? A: While weight loss is more common in hyperthyroidism, some people may experience weight gain. This may occur if they eat significantly more than usual due to increased appetite. 6 Q: What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism in men?

Sugar is an important source of energy for the body. Symptoms of low blood sugar levels include headache, nervousness, shaking, concentration difficulties, sweating and nausea. The treatment of hypoglycemia is to give sugar, wether in food or drinks or, in severe cases, in fluid directly into the blood. Most people recover well, but severe hypoglycemia can be life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.",
    "risks": "Sugar is an important source of energy for the body, and the most important fuel for the brain. The body can partially compensate for low blood sugar levels, but eventually needs food in order to produce sugar quickly. Hypoglycemia can occur in anyone, though some people are more likely to have hypoglycemic episodes than others. People with diabetes who take medications to control their blood sugar levels, people who do not eat regularly and athletes may all be at risk of having a hypoglycemic episode, as are people with medical conditions which affect their liver and pancreas. In rare instances, a cancer that produces excess insulin can cause recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.",

    "what_is_hypothermia": "Hypothermia is when the body’s core temperature drops below 35 degrees Celsius or 95 degrees Fahrenheit. It is a life-threatening condition and if suspected as a diagnosis, medical attention should be sought immediately.People in specific age ranges (very young or elderly) are at increased risk. The causes vary from prolonged outdoor activities in a cold environment, exposure to cold water, insufficient indoor heating, and some medical conditions and medication. Generally, the lower the body temperature is, the more serious the condition is for the person affected. However, symptoms vary from person to person. They can include shivering, pale skin, confusion, and many more.For a correct diagnosis, the body core temperature must be measured professionally. Laboratory tests are necessary to check for complications. Treatment for hypothermia revolves around warming up the affected person. Steps to keeping the affected person warm before an ambulance arrives include covering them in blankets and blocking them from the wind. When hypothermia is caused by exposure to cold temperatures, the best approach to avoiding it is to keep warm. To ensure warmth, preparation is required, such as choosing appropriate clothing if the forecast predicts cold weather and having a well-heated and insulated home. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , If you think that you might have hypothermia, you can try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms. If hypothermia is suspected, seek medical attention immediately.",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Hypothermia is caused by the body losing more heat than it is producing. There are four major ways the body can lose heat, which are: 2 radiation heat loss in the surrounding atmosphere conduction heat loss to an object or surface that is cooler than the body convection heat loss caused by air or wind passing across the skin evaporation when sweat evaporates on the skin. In the majority of cases, hypothermia is caused by convective heat loss to cold air or by conductive heat loss to water. Factors that can cause hypothermia include: 2 , 4 , 6 , 7 Primary Hypothermia hypothermia from env ironmental exposure prolonged outdoor activities in cold climate not wearing adequate clothing or wearing wet clothing living in a poorly-heated home falling into cold water people particularly at risk of this: homeless people people under the influence of alcohol or drugs elderly people babies and young children Secondary Hypothermia hypothermia caused by an underlying co ndition or medication medical conditions , such as: hypothyroidism , adrenal insufficiency, sepsis , neuromuscular disease , malnutrition, thiamine deficiency, impaired mental status, stroke , Parkinson's disease , Alzheimer's dementia , trauma , and hypoglycemia Good to know: Newborn babies have less control over the regulation of heat in their bodies compared to the general population. This is especially true of smaller newborns, such as those born prematurely or who are underweight. Medical professionals will generally take several steps to ensure that a child is kept warm after birth to prevent hypothermia from developing. These steps can include making sure that the birthing room temperature is above 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) and by wrapping babies in warmed blankets immediately after birth. 8 , 9 , 10",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Hypothermia can progress through different stages of severity: 2 mild hypothermia – core temperature around 32 to 35°C (90 to 95°F) moderate hypothermia – core temperature around 28 to 32°C (82 to 90°F) severe/profound hypothermia – core temperature below 28ºC (82°F). However, symptoms of hypothermia may vary from person to person and accurate temperature measurements can be challenging. That’s why there is a large overlap between the different stages. In most cases, the symptoms of each particular stage include: 2 , 3 , 4 , cold stressed temperature not hypothermic yet shivering no signs of impaired mental or physical functioning mild hypothermia still conscious but potential signs of confusion shivering not able to care for self moderate hypothermia decreased consciousness or even unconscious shivering or no shivering severe/profound hypothermia unconscious no shivering.

    "what_is_hypothyroidism": "Hypothyroidism refers to a condition in which the thyroid gland produces less hormone than normal. These hormones regulate the body's metabolism (turning food into energy and controlling the speed of cell growth). The condition can be congenital (present from birth), or occur later in life as a result of thyroid damage or conditions which cause inflammation or infection in the thyroid gland. See this resource for more information on congenital hypothyroidism . Symptoms depend on the age of the person, but include tiredness, dry hair and skin, slowed thinking and weight gain. The treatment of this condition is replacement of the thyroid hormone with medication .",
    "risks": "The thyroid gland sits at the front of the throat , and produces a hormone (thyroid hormone) which controls metabolism (cell activity and growth). There are many causes for decreased thyroid gland function (hypothyroidism). These include not enough iodine in the diet, surgical or radiation damage to the thyroid gland, and infections or inflammation of the thyroid gland. Some children are born with a thyroid gland which does not work well. Hypothyroidism most commonly affects adults, though it can occur at any age. Both men and women are affected by the condition although it is more common in women. Some conditions that cause hypothyroidism tend to run in families, so people with a family member with hypothyroidism are often more likely to develop hypothyroidism.",
    "symptoms": "The early symptoms of poor thyroid function include tiredness, constipation, brittle nails, dry hair and feeling cold. As the hypothyroidism continues, people develop a low mood, decreased motivation, slowed thinking, weight gain, a slow heart rate and a hoarse voice. Some people may develop a lump in their thyroid gland or swelling of the neck. Babies with congenital hypothyroidism (hypothyroidism since birth) have feeding difficulties, prolonged newborn jaundice (yellow skin after birth), severe constipation, and tend to move less than other babies. These babies tend to not grow and develop at the same rate as other children. Hypothyroidism in older people can be confused with dementia.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and clinical examination, and is confirmed by blood tests which measure the amount of hormone the thyroid gland is producing.",
    "treatment": "Treatment consists of replacing thyroid hormone with medication . Replacing thyroid hormone may require regular blood tests until the correct dosage is reached.",
    "prevention": "Avoiding radiation to the thyroid, and taking plenty of iodine in the diet can help to prevent some cases of hypothyroidism. In many countries, pregnant women and newborns are screened (tested without symptoms) for hypothyroidism.

The syndrome often results in swelling of the feet, hands, and face and foamy urine. Different conditions can lead to nephrotic syndrome, and treatment of the corresponding symptoms depends on the underlying cause. If no definitive cause for the kidney damage can be identified, then it is referred to as \"idiopathic.\" This is often the case in children.",
    "what_are_risk_factors": "The filtering units in the kidneys are called glomeruli. These filter waste products and excess water from the blood and normally prevent protein from escaping from the blood into the urine. When these filters are damaged, too much protein escapes from the blood into the urine. In turn, fluid accumulates in the body and causes swelling. There are several conditions that can damage the glomeruli and cause the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome. It is only called idiopathic once all of the possible underlying conditions can be ruled out and no other cause is found.",
    "what_are_symptoms": "Possible symptoms include swelling of the feet, ankles, or eyelids, weight gain (due to fluid accumulation), foamy urine, loss of appetite, and fatigue. When a large amount of fluid accumulates in the body, it can eventually build up in the abdomen and chest, leading to a large, tight abdomen and shortness of breath.",
    "how_is_idiopathic_nephrotic_syndrome_diagnosed": "Diagnosis is made by a physician and depends on protein levels in the blood and urine. Blood tests are also performed to check kidney and liver function and to look for inflammation. An ultrasound examination may be needed.

Medications used to control symptoms often include anti-inflammatory steroids. In some cases, diuretics (also known as water tablets, to reduce fluid buildup in the body), blood pressure medication (to protect the kidneys from further damage), and anti-inflammatory medications (to reduce any inflammation that could lead to kidney damage) are also used. It is recommended that the intake of salt and fluids be reduced.",
    "what_is_the_outlook_for_idiopathic_nephrotic_syndrome": "Recovery from nephrotic syndrome is good in many cases, with no further problems. However, it depends on the underlying cause, the age of the affected person, and how they respond to treatment. In severe cases, kidney failure may occur. This case requires dialysis to replace kidney function and eventually a kidney transplant."

    "what_is_impetigo": "Impetigo 1 2 , or school sores, is a bacterial infection of the skin. It is caused by Staphylococcal or Streptococcal bacteria. It is a relatively common infection, and most commonly affects school-aged children. It is easily spread by skin-to-skin contact, or via objects touched by someone with the infection. It causes itchy, painless bumps or sores which become blisters and burst, leaving a light brown crust. It may take several weeks to clear but antibiotics shorten the time taken to heal and reduce the spread of the bacteria. With appropriate treatment, most people recover well.",
    "risks": "Impetigo occurs when bacteria which normally live on the body get into small breaks in the skin and begin to overgrow. These bacteria are normally Staphylococcal and Streptococcal bacteria, which also cause other medical conditions, such as tonsillitis, boils and wound infections. This condition can affect people of all ages, although it most commonly affects children. Impetigo is most common in the warm months of the year, and in places with poor access to health care.",
    "symptoms": "Impetigo begins as a red bump. This may occur on the face, arms, legs, trunk or buttocks. These bumps may develop to a blister or an open sore, which forms a yellow-brown crust. The sores are itchy but painless.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually based on the appearance of the sores. The diagnosis can be confirmed by investigating fluid from as the sores for Staphylococcal or Streptococcal bacteria.",
    "treatment": "School sores are treated by keeping the sores clean. This can be done using low-irritant soaps and antiseptic lotions, such as lotions containing iodine, along with antibiotic creams. Sores should be kept covered if possible. If there is a widespread infection, antibiotic tablets may be needed.",
    "prevention": "People with impetigo should stay home from daycare, school or work until the sores form a crust or they have had 24hrs of antibiotic treatment. Sore should be covered when returning to school or work. Maintaining good hygiene measures, such as washing hands, bed clothes and objects used by the affected person, can help to prevent spreading the infection.",

    "what_is_infantile_atopic_dermatitis": "Infantile atopic dermatitis , often called atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema or baby eczema , is a very common skin condition in children. People with this condition suffer dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) due to allergies or having skin which is sensitive to certain substances. It tends to affect children before they turn five. The typical symptoms are a red, itchy rash and scaly, dry skin. These symptoms tend to flare (get worse) in response to certain triggers. Treatment involves keeping the skin moist and using creams or medications to soothe the skin and treat the inflammation. Many children with atopic dermatitis will find that their condition improves over time, and may not have any symptoms by the time they are teenagers.",

Children with allergies (including hay fever and allergic asthma) , or who have parents with these conditions, tend to have a higher chance of having atopic eczema. Factors that trigger atopic eczema can be dryness, heat and sweating, irritating substances (such as certain clothing or chemicals), emotional or physical stress, skin infections and allergens, often food.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/infantile-colic/",
    "what_is_infantile_colic": "Infantile colic is a condition, in which an otherwise healthy baby cries excessively, frequently and at an abnormally high pitch. These crying episodes, which often occur in the evening, are the most typical symptom. Colicky babies may also be inconsolable during a crying episode. A physician should exclude any other cause for the excessive crying in order to confirm the diagnosis of infantile colic. Laboratory tests are not usually necessary, unless there is reason to suspect that the crying is caused by an underlying medical condition. 1 Generally, the condition tends to resolve on its own, with no long-term complications. Studies suggest that up to 40 percent of all newborns and infants experience infantile colic at some point. 2",
    "infantile_colic_symptoms": "The most typical symptom of infantile colic is episodes of high-pitched, excessive crying, which often occur during the evening hours. Colicky crying is often described as more high-pitched and strained than ordinary crying 1 . The rule of three is often used to determine whether the excessive crying is the result of colic. Colicky babies may cry for: 2 Three or more hours a day Three or more days a week Three or more weeks Not all babies with colic will necessarily follow this pattern. If a parent is unsure of whether the crying is colic or not, they should consult their baby’s doctor or nurse. Good to know: Colicky crying is still within the normal range of infant crying. Most infants cry more in the afternoon and evening, with their tendency to cry peaking at around six weeks of age. The difference between normal crying and colicky crying is that babies with colic cry for longer than babies without, and are much harder to soothe. 2 Babies with colic may show distinctive behaviour while crying. They may: 2 1 Grimace or scowl Furrow their brows Draw their legs up to their belly Clench fists Flush Stiffen The infants are usually otherwise healthy babies, with a normal appetite and normal weight gain. However, some behaviours that are associated with crying, but are not part of normal crying, may indicate an undiagnosed cardiopulmonary disorder. These include: 2 Apnea, a temporary pause in breathing during sleep, or struggling to breath Cyanosis, a bluish colour in the skin or mucus membranes that indicates low oxygen levels in the blood Fever Good to know: If a baby exhibits any of these three symptoms, they should be taken to a medical practitioner immediately. Worried that your baby may have infantile colic? Begin a free symptoms assessment in the Ada app now.",
    "causes": "The causes of infantile colic are largely unknown. However, colic may be the result of physical, social and/or environmental factors that may be out of the parents’ control. These include: 2 1 3 An imbalance in the infant’s gut microflora Overfeeding or underfeeding Food allergies, including allergy to milk proteins and lactose intolerance Incomplete burping after feeding Exposure to cigarette smoke or metabolites of cigarette smoke Parental stress or anxiety There is some evidence that colic is more common in infants whose mothers have had postpartum depression . 1 It is known that babies respond to parental anxiety. Lactose intolerance is a relatively rare cause of colic. There is some evidence that breastfed infants are less likely to have infantile colic. 4 There is no evidence that fermentation in the colon causes colic. 1",
    "risk_factors": "Infantile colic is commonly observed in newborns between the ages of two weeks and four months, with the condition typically peaking at around six weeks of age. It is equally frequent in both male and female infants. Good to know: If a toddler is exhibiting colicky symptoms, it is unlikely to be colic. The child should be examined by a pediatrician, and other causes for excessive crying should be investigated. If your child is feeling unwell, you can check the symptoms via a personal health assessment in the Ada app .",
    "diagnosis": "To confirm the diagnosis, other causes for the crying should always be excluded first. Infantile colic is often defined by rule of three: crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week and for longer than three weeks, in an infant who is well-fed and otherwise healthy. However, other things that the doctor will take into account are: 5 The age of the baby at the onset of symptoms of colic How the parents respond to the crying How intense the crying is How the child is fed, including what position the baby is in, whether it is burped, and whether it is bottle fed or breastfed If the baby is being bottle fed, the type of milk and the type of teat used will also be examined. If the baby is being breastfed, the doctor may also ask about her diet. Laboratory tests are usually not needed. Physicians will take note of the baby’s family situation and their medical history. They will also take a history of the baby’s feeding and diet patterns in order to rule out gastroesophageal disorders such as gastroesophagael reflux disease (GERD) and allergies. 2 To rule out urinary tract infections or other infections, the baby’s patterns of defecation, urination and sleeping will also be reviewed. If there is any history of fever, vomiting or trauma, this should be noted because it may be relevant. 5 Doctors who are examining a baby who is suspected of having colic will also routinely check for: Fractures, cuts, scrapes or bruises Hairs or fibres wrapped around fingers or toes Skin irritation and diaper rash",
    "infantile_colic_treatment": "Since the causes of the condition are largely unknown, treatment options are limited. As the condition does not cause serious problems, parents are advised to develop techniques to help the infant to stop crying, such as singing, swaddling or holding the infant. It is also important to make sure that the baby is in an upright position during feeding. Changes in feeding habits or diet are usually not recommended.\n\nOne of the most important elements of treatment for infantile colic is keeping the parents calm and to reassure them that the condition is temporary and that their baby is generally healthy. 2 Colic is distressing for babies and their caregivers, and colicky babies are at increased risk of being shaken and injured, 3 as parents may become frustrated that they cannot calm or console the baby during a crying episode. Because colicky babies cannot be soothed, caregivers may set the baby down in a safe place, such as their cot, to cry unattended for a short while. This is acceptable, as long as the baby is not cold, wet, unwell, hungry or too hot, 3 , and as long as the baby is not left alone for very long. Because colicky crying also occurs most often in the evening, parents may also experience some sleep loss, which can contribute to feelings of frustration and stress. Parents should take care to ensure that they are rested, possibly by taking it in turns to attend to the baby. It is also acceptable to leave the baby with other competent caregivers for short periods of time, in order for parents to rest. 3 Good to know: Colicky babies should not be left unattended for long periods of time.\n\nMedication is not usually very useful in treating colic. In some cases, if the mother is breastfeeding the infant, colic can be alleviated by excluding some foods from the mother’s diet. These include: 1 Cow’s milk and dairy products Eggs Wheat Nuts Spice and garlic Caffeine Alcohol Eliminating these foods will not necessarily help relieve infantile colic in all cases. If the cause of the colicky crying is suspected to be an allergy to cow’s milk, a low-lactose formula or lactase drops, which are added to milk, may be recommended. Soy-based formulas are not very often recommended for colicky babies. 1 However, lactose intolerance is relatively rare. Good to know: Spinal manipulation, while occasionally said to relieve colic, is unsafe for babies and should not be considered as a treatment option. Likewise, sedatives such as phenobarbital and chloral hydrate are unsafe for babies and should not be used in the treatment of colic.\n\nGripe water 6 is a traditional remedy for colic, and while there is anecdotal evidence that it works, no formal reviews have ever proven that it is helpful. Many brands of gripe water contain alcohol, dill oil, an alkalinizing agent, such as bicarbonate of soda, and sugar. In many countries, the composition of gripe water is not regulated. Gripe water may also cause constipation. Alcohol is unsafe for babies, while dill oil may only be of help in cases where excess gas is a cause of pain. Bicarbonate of soda is not thought to be helpful, as stomach acid is not the cause of colic. There is some evidence that administering an oral sweet solution of sugar to babies does help to relieve pain, and this is probably the basis for the success of gripe water in relieving colic, as the sweetness itself is soothing. However, in this case, it is better to consult a doctor about using a simple oral glucose solution rather than gripe water.",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/infective-endocarditis/",
    "what_is_infective_endocarditis": "Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart and the heart valves , called the endocardium. The infection is caused by certain bacteria or, less often, fungi entering the bloodstream. Infective endocarditis usually affects people who have a damaged heart, who: Have an artificial device in their heart Have a congenital heart defect Have had endocarditis before Inject drugs intravenously It is an uncommon condition, with around 15,000 new cases in the United States each year. 1 Symptoms vary from person to person, but can include fever, shortness of breath and skin changes. Treatment is with intravenous antibiotics, initially administered in hospital. Surgery may be necessary to repair any damage to the heart. Without treatment, infective endocarditis can be life-threatening. 2 3",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of infective endocarditis vary depending on the type of bacterium or fungus causing the infection and the overall health of the person. Symptoms can appear suddenly, which is called acute infective endocarditis, or gradually over several months; this is called subacute infective endocarditis. 1 2 Common symptoms of infective endocarditis include: 1 2 Fever Chills Sweating at night Heart murmur or change in heart murmur, i.e. an abnormal sound made by the heart between beats Nausea and vomiting Feeling tired Aching muscles and joints Chest and/or back pain Malaise and fatigue Weakness Headache Lack of appetite Weight loss Small, painful, red or purple bumps on the fingers and/or toes, called Osler nodes Very small, painless, dark spots on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet, called Janeway lesions Small spots, caused by broken blood vessels, under fingernails, called splinter hemorrhages or on chest, whites of eyes or in mouth Swelling in the feet or legs If you are concerned that you or someone you know may have infective endocarditis, you can do a free Ada symptom assessment at any time.\n\nInfective endocarditis can cause other conditions, some of which are very serious. They are generally caused by emboli , which are small pieces of matter that break away from the infection site and travel to other parts of the body where they can cause abscesses, which are painful collections of pus, and other problems. 2\n\nUp to 50 percent of people with infective endocarditis develop further heart problems . These can include: 1 2 4 5 Heart murmur Congestive heart failure Arrhythmia, which is an abnormality of the rhythm of the heart beat Damage to heart valves, which may manifest as a heart murmur, an abnormal sound made by the heart between beats An abscess, a collection of pus in the heart tissue Heart attack Some of the conditions listed above can occur immediately, but others may develop and become apparent only some time later.\n\nA pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the lungs. In infective endocarditis, the cause of the clot is an emboli. Pulmonary embolism is an extremely serious condition and can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. Symptoms include: 6 Shortness of breath Chest pain Persistent cough Dizziness For more information, see the resource on pulmonary embolism .\n\nUp to 40 percent of people with infective endocarditis will experience some form of neurological complication . Stroke is the most common neurological complication to experience. 7 If emboli reach the brain, they can cause a stroke or seizure . Both conditions are very serious and can be life-threatening. Symptoms of a stroke include: Weakness or drooping in the face, often on one side only Numbness, weakness or pins and needles in one or both arms Difficulty speaking or slurred speech For more information, see the resource on ischemic stroke .\n\nSome cases of complications of infective endocarditis are caused by clumps of cells and other matter which form in the bloodstream around the infection site. These clumps of matter are called vegetations. Parts of a vegetation, called emboli, can break off and travel via the bloodstream to other parts of the body, causing complications such as abscesses or seizures. Conditions that may develop in the brain from emboli caused by infective endocarditis include: 2 7 Abscess Bleeding inside the brain Meningitis Problems relating to the lungs can include pneumonia or a buildup of fluid around the lungs. If an emboli becomes septic, it can cause pus to build up around the lungs. 2 8 Infective endocarditis can cause glomerulonephritis, which is a condition where the kidneys become inflamed and stop filtering metabolic waste products properly. Symptoms include a puffy face, flank pain, urinating less than usual and blood in the urine. If left untreated, glomerulonephritis can lead to kidney failure . 8 9 The spleen may also become enlarged , a condition called splenomegaly, which can cause abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness when eating. 10",
    "causes": "Infective endocarditis is caused by bacteria or fungi entering the bloodstream and settling on the endocardium , which is the inner lining of the heart and heart valves. The most common types of organism responsible for infective endocarditis are: 8 11 12 13 14 15 Staphylococcus aureus, which is the most common cause of infective endocarditis Streptococci, which is the second most common cause of infective endocarditis Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most often found in hospital-acquired infections Enterococci, most often found in elderly men and acquired via the genitourinary tract A fungus, such as Aspergillus These infections can be acquired in various ways, such as: 2 7 16 Intravenous drug use When a medical device is inserted into a vein , such as an intravenous catheter, a device for inserting medication or other liquids directly into a vein, or a pacing wire, a temporary device to stabilize a slow heartbeat Dental hygiene and dental procedures if the teeth and gums are in poor condition Infections in other body parts, such as the gut, genitourinary tract or skin Good to know: Most people with infective endocarditis also have a heart defect or a prosthetic device in the heart , such as an artificial heart valve or a pacemaker. Damaged and artificial sites in the heart encourage blood clotting and the formation of structures called thrombi, which provide bacteria with a place to thrive. Some bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus are able to infect people who have healthy hearts, but this is uncommon. 1 17 18",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of infective endocarditis is based on the symptoms described, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests. Diagnosis can be difficult because subacute infective endocarditis can develop gradually over many months, and because, in the modern era, few people present with classical symptoms of fever, heart murmur, bacteremia 19 , Osler nodes or Janeway’s lesions. 8 20 Infective endocarditis should be suspected if the affected person has a fever and also: Has used intravenous drugs Has a cardiac device such as a pacemaker or a prosthetic valve Has a congenital heart disease Has recently had a dental procedure Has recently had an infection To identify the type of organism causing the endocarditis, three or more sets of blood cultures will be drawn from different sites on the body, over 24 hours . However, if the person has previously been given antibiotics, the cultures may be negative. One study found negative blood cultures in many of the people examined. 20 If you’re concerned about infective endocarditis, you can do a free symptom assessment for yourself or someone else by using the Ada app . Imaging studies can reveal signs of heart damage or vegetation. Tests normally performed include: 1 8 21 Echocardiography , which uses ultrasound waves to produce an image of the heart and heart valves Computerized tomography (CT) scan and an MRI scan , which can detect complications of infective endocarditis",
    "treatment": "Treating infective endocarditis is done by administering intravenous antibiotics normally for between two to eight weeks. The type of antibiotic will depend on the cause of the infection and whether there is antibiotic resistance. Treatment is usually begun in hospital to allow the person to be monitored by a cardiologist and infectious disease specialist for signs of improvement. 2 8 Surgery may be needed to repair damage to heart valves or to remove sources of bacteremia 19 . If infective endocarditis is caused by a fungus, the person will likely need to undergo surgery, as this form of the condition is more difficult to treat. 2",
    "preventing_infective_endocarditis": "Some people are more at risk of infective endocarditis than others . These include people who: Have an existing heart defect or a congenital heart defect Have an artificial device implanted in the heart Use intravenous drugs Have had endocarditis before These people should be aware of the symptoms of infective endocarditis and see a doctor immediately if they suspect infection. Anyone at high risk should practice good hygiene, which includes: 2 8 Taking care of teeth and gums , including gentle flossing and using a soft toothbrush that does not abrade the gums, as infection can enter the body via a gum infection Keeping dentists informed of the risk of infective endocarditis, as they may decide to prescribe a course of antibiotics before any procedure Practicing sterile needle use when injecting into the veins Avoiding tattoos and body piercings Taking care with any catheter or other device inserted into a vein , particularly during any stay in hospital",

    "condition": "Influenza (flu)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/influenza-infection/",
    "what_is_influenza_flu": "Influenza infection, also known as the flu, is a common viral infection of the airways that most often occurs in fall and winter. It can cause multiple symptoms, including fever, cough, a runny nose, and muscle aches. 1 Influenza can be caused by a number of different viruses and is spread from person to person, primarily through sneezing and coughing. 2 When an infected person sneezes, coughs or talks, they may send infected water droplets into the air. It is then possible for a nearby person to inhale these and contract the infection themselves. It is also possible to catch influenza indirectly by touching a contaminated surface or object and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth. 3\n\nBecause influenza is so infectious, people with mild cases of the flu are recommended to avoid contact with others by staying at home during their illness. In most cases, no specific treatment is needed, and people recover from flu within a week. 4 However, people with severe cases of the infection, or who are at higher risk of developing flu-related complications, may need to seek medical attention. 5 In rare instances, influenza can cause severe complications, in which case the condition may become life-threatening.",
    "influenza_type_a_vs_b": "There are two main types of influenza (flu) that affect humans, known as influenza A and influenza B . These two viruses are responsible for the majority of seasonal flu epidemics that break out each year, with most cases occurring during the winter period. 6 Influenza A is believed to cause more than 70 percent of flu cases in a typical season. Of the remaining 30 percent of flu cases, the majority are caused by influenza B. 7 Both types of the virus result in similar flu symptoms. The viruses that cause influenza A are constantly evolving, meaning that new strains of the infection develop fairly often. 5 The influenza B virus is also able to develop over time, although at a slower rate than influenza A. Because the viruses are constantly changing, it is possible to contract influenza infection multiple times in a lifetime. Falling ill with one strain of the flu may help to build immunity against that particular strain, but it is unlikely to protect against a different strain in the future. 8 Annual flu shots are typically updated every year in order to vaccinate against the influenza strain, or strains, that is/are expected to be most common that year. 9 10",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Influenza can cause mild to severe symptoms that are variable from person to person. Symptoms can come on very suddenly and most often begin to appear one to four days after infection. 4 However, in some cases the onset of influenza symptoms can occur a matter of hours after exposure. 11\n\nTypical signs and symptoms of flu include: 1 5 7 12 High fever or feeling feverish Dry cough Sore throat Headache Cold-like symptoms , such as a runny nose and watery eyes Muscle and joint aches Fatigue and feeling weak Feeling generally unwell Respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and a sore throat, are often minimal at first, but can develop to become more prominent as the infection progresses. 9 Vomiting and diarrhea may also be present; this is more common in children than adults. 12 The severity of many symptoms can range from mild to severe. For example, while a fever is a common symptom of influenza infection, it might be a low fever of around 100 F / 37.7 C or a high fever of around 104 F / 40 C. Other people with influenza infection may simply feel feverish, without displaying a high temperature at all. 13 Symptoms usually peak within the first couple of days of their onset and then begin to subside. Coughing, weakness, and tiredness are often the final symptoms to disappear. Most people with an influenza infection recover within a week. 9\n\nWhile unpleasant, typical flu symptoms do not usually require medical intervention. 14 However, there are a number of additional symptoms which may indicate a more serious infection or the presence of a flu-related complication, such as pneumonia. Symptoms that may be a warning sign of severe influenza sickness include: 14 4 Shortness of breath or fast breathing Increased heart rate Chest or abdominal pain Recurrent high fever Dizziness Confusion In children, additional symptoms may include: Trouble breathing Bluish tinge to the skin Inability or unwillingness to eat or drink Fever with a rash Such symptoms may be an indication of a more serious influenza infection or of a flu-related complication. People who are exhibiting more severe flu symptoms should seek medical attention.\n\nIt can be difficult to tell the difference between influenza and the common cold . Both are respiratory illnesses that often cause similar symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and a sore throat. However, identifiable differences to look out for include: 15 Flu symptoms are usually more intense than cold symptoms Flu symptoms tend to arrive quickly, whereas cold symptoms appear more gradually Fever and headaches are common symptoms of flu, but are rare with colds Flu can cause more serious complications, such as pneumonia. It is not usual for a cold to result in any other health problems",
    "what_is_the_cause": "Influenza is caused by an influenza virus. It is a highly contagious infection that can affect anyone. Because it is such a common condition, exact data on how many people contract the flu each year is not readily available. However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the flu has caused between 9.3 million to 49 million illnesses annually in the United States since 2010. Flu is usually contracted through the inhalation of contaminated water droplets. Often, these water droplets are released through the nose or mouth of an infected person. Three common ways in which the virus is spread are: 3 9 Airborne droplets. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they can release water droplets into the air. These airborne droplets may then be inhaled by another person Direct contact. Direct contact with the water droplets of an infected person, e.g. sharing household utensils or kissing Indirect contact. Handling an object or surface which has been contaminated with the influenza virus, e.g. touching a used tissue. 16",
    "is_influenza_dangerous": "Although anybody can contract influenza, the majority of people with the illness are able to recover at home without the need for hospitalization or medical care. Most affected people make a full recovery within a week. 4 However, there are certain groups of people who are at higher risk of developing flu-related complications. Such groups include: 5 7 1 17 Adults over the age of 65 Children under the age of five, in particular under the age of two People living in closed environments such as nursing homes or other care facilities Pregnant people and people up to two weeks after giving birth Native Americans People with certain pre-existing medical conditions Medical conditions which may increase the risk of flu-related complications developing include: 1 5 7 17 18 Asthma Diabetes Heart diseases, such as heart failure and coronary artery disease Lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis and bronchitis Kidney problems , such as chronic nephritic syndrome Liver disorders, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis Severe anemia Severe obesity, classified with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 or higher Medical conditions or treatments that can result in a weakened immune system, such as HIV infection or chemotherapy",
    "flu_diagnosis": "Diagnosis of flu is usually based on the symptoms experienced and an evaluation by a doctor. Diagnosis may be particularly swift if there is a known presence of a flu outbreak in the local community. Further tests are often not necessary because a clinical evaluation is usually enough to recommend a course of treatment. 19 However, further diagnostic tests may be recommended if: Diagnosis is uncertain Symptoms are severe The affected person is at higher risk of developing complications An outbreak of respiratory illness has occurred in the local community, and the test may be able to confirm flu as the cause\n\nTwo common tests used to help diagnose influenza are rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) and rapid molecular assays. Both tests involve swabbing a person’s nose or throat and testing the mucus for the virus. Results can often be produced within 20 minutes. However, while the tests are quick and simple to perform, results are not as accurate as other diagnostic methods. It is possible to still receive a flu diagnosis, even with a negative test result. 19 Despite their limitations, the speed and simplicity of RIDTs can make them useful in promptly identifying influenza as the cause of a respiratory disease outbreak, particularly in care settings such as hospitals and nursing homes. If RIDTs confirm positive results in one or more people with suspected influenza, a swift decision can then be made to implement infection control measures and administer treatment. Blood tests may be suggested if further complications are suspected. 5 If the person is thought to have developed pneumonia or is displaying significant respiratory problems, a chest X-ray may also be conducted. 9\n\nWorried that you or a loved one may have flu ?

    "what_are_treatments_for_influenza_flu": "There is no specific medicine used to target the influenza virus itself. Instead, treatment aims to manage and ease the symptoms of influenza, until the body’s natural immune system is able to clear the infection. 7\n\nMost people are able to recover from influenza at home, without the need for medical intervention. 2 Home remedies that may help manage the symptoms of influenza include: 5 7 4 Staying hydrated by drinking lots of fluids, such as water Resting and avoiding strenuous activities Reducing fever and aches with acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Reducing cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and sore throat, with common cold treatment methods such as nasal decongestants and oral lozenges\n\nPeople with a severe case of the flu, or those who are at greater risk of developing complications, may be prescribed antiviral medications by their doctor. 5 People who are at high risk of developing complications may also be prescribed antiviral medication as a preventive measure, in order to reduce the risk of contracting the flu altogether. 20 The most common antiviral medications used are: 7 21 Oseltamivir, typically swallowed as a pill or liquid Zanamivir, typically inhaled as a powder Peramivir, typically injected as a liquid These medications target both influenza type A and type B. They do not kill the virus, but they can lessen the symptoms and shorten the period of illness by a couple of days. 22 Antiviral drugs are also used to reduce the risk of the affected person developing complications.

    "flu_prevention": "The best precaution against flu is to be vaccinated against it.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends an annual flu vaccination for all people in the U.S. over the age of six months old. 23 It is considered the best way to help prevent seasonal flu and its potential complications. The flu vaccine is especially important for people who are at higher risk of developing flu-related complications, such as the elderly or people with certain medical conditions. Vaccinations are updated on an annual basis, in order to protect against the most prevalent strains of the influenza virus that year. 9 It is recommended that people receive a flu vaccine in early fall, before the flu season begins. The two main vaccination methods are: 7 Flu shot. An injection is the more common vaccination method and can be given to anyone aged six months or over, including pregnant people. People over the age of 65 may receive a slightly higher dose of the vaccine. Flu nasal spray. This vaccination method is typically reserved for otherwise healthy people between 2 to 49 years old. It is not suitable for certain people, including pregnant people, those with a weakened immune system, children under the age of 18 who take long-term aspirin medication or asthmatic children aged between two to four years old.\n\nVaccination against the flu has multiple benefits, including: Preventing influenza infection. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that flu vaccination prevented around 5.3 million influenza illnesses in the United States during 2016-2017 24 Preventing influenza-related hospitalization. A 2017 study found that the vaccination in the United States reduced the number of adult flu-related hospitalizations by an average of around 40 percent 25 Reducing the severity of influenza infection. In the United States, flu vaccination has resulted in reduced flu-related deaths, intensive care admissions and hospitalization duration, according to one 2017 study Life-saving in children. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2017 was the first of its kind to show that a flu vaccination can significantly reduce the a child’s risk of dying from influenza infection 26 24\n\nDue to how contagious influenza viruses are, it is important to limit the risk of spreading the infection to others. For this reason, people with the flu are recommended to stay at home until around five to seven days after first becoming ill. Children and people with a weakened immune system can take longer than seven days to recover from the illness and therefore may remain infectious for longer. 3 As flu symptoms often only appear a couple of days after becoming infected, it is possible for a person to pass on the flu virus before realizing they themselves are infected. It is also possible to contract the flu but display no symptoms, however these people are still able to spread the infection to others. 5\n\nPracticing good personal hygiene can also help prevent the spread of influenza. Useful preventative measures include: 14 Washing hands frequently, ideally with soap and water, or hand sanitizer Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth unless hands are fully clean\n\nAs well as being used to treat influenza (flu), antiviral medication may occasionally be prescribed as a preventive measure to reduce the likelihood of a high-risk person contracting the condition and developing influenza-related complications . 20 This preventive approach is known as prophylaxis. Because the flu vaccine is considered to be the best precaution against influenza infection, antiviral prophylaxis is usually considered only in specific circumstances. Typically, it is only suggested to high-risk people who have been exposed to another person with influenza, and also fall into certain categories, such as: 20 They received the flu vaccine within the last two weeks They cannot receive the flu vaccine, e.g. due to an allergy They may not be responsive to the flu vaccine, e.g. people receiving immunosuppressive medications Antiviral prophylaxis may also be used to control an influenza outbreak among high-risk people in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes. In such cases, antiviral medication may be prescribed to both residents and staff. 20",
    "what_are_the_complications_that_can_arise_from_the_flu": "While the majority of people who contract influenza make a full recovery, complications can occur sometimes. Complications are more likely to develop in certain groups of people, as outlined in the risk factors section above. Some complications can develop to become severe or even life-threatening. Pneumonia is a particularly common and serious potential complication of the flu. 12 At-risk groups of people, such as the elderly, or those with certain pre-existing medical conditions, should contact a doctor if flu is suspected in order to limit the risk of developing a flu-related complication.\n\nModerate complications that can arise from influenza include: 5 12 4 Sinus infection, also known as sinusitis Certain types of ear infection, such as acute otitis media Young children may experience fits caused by the fever, known as febrile seizures Moderate complications are generally not thought to cause any long-term health problems, although some may require additional medical treatment.\n\nThere are a number of severe complications that can develop through having influenza. Pneumonia is the most common complication of flu, which can develop to become a potentially life-threatening condition. 7\n\nPneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs and a common complication of influenza. Flu-related pneumonia can either develop as a direct result of the influenza virus, known as primary viral pneumonia, or, more commonly, due to a combination of the virus and an added bacterial infection, such as bacterial bronchitis . This is known as secondary bacterial pneumonia. 5 Symptoms that may indicate the development of either primary viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia, include: 7 4 15 Shortness of breath Fast breathing Increased heart rate Chest pain Recurrent high fever A deep, wet cough that produces mucus or phlegm, rather than the dry cough that is a common symptom of influenza Bloody phlegm 27\n\nOther potentially severe complications of influenza include: 5 9 12 28 An inflammation of the muscles, known as myositis An inflammation of the heart muscle, known as myocarditis An inflammation of the brain, known as encephalitis Sepsis Worsening of certain existing medical conditions, such as asthma or chronic heart failure Medical help should be sought by anyone who is worried they may have developed a complication due to influenza, whether moderate or severe.

    "influenza_faqs": "Q: Is influenza infection contagious? A: Yes, influenza infection is very contagious. It is believed that people infected with the flu virus can spread it to other people up to six feet away. 3 The infection most commonly spreads through airborne water droplets, released as a result of sneezing or coughing. It is also possible to catch the infection by coming into direct contact with someone who has influenza, as well as by touching a contaminated object or surface. Q: Does flu give you a rash? A: It is not typical to flu to result in a skin rash. However, there are a small number of reported cases where a rash has accompanied the flu, particularly in children. 29 30 If a skin rash develops during influenza, it is recommended to contact a doctor in order to rule out any other possible causes of the rash. Measles is another contagious virus that can cause respiratory symptoms. However, unlike the flu, it usually also causes a skin rash. This means, it is possible to mistake the early symptoms of measles for the flu. Q: What home remedies can be used to treat the flu? A: Treatment of the flu focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the illness. Many people are able to recover from influenza infection at home, without needing to visit a hospital or receive medical intervention. Remedies that can be used at home to help ease the signs of flu include: Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water Resting Reducing fever and aches with acetaminophen, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Reducing cold-like symptoms with common cold treatment methods Q: Can flu be treated with antibiotics? A: No, influenza viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics. Because the infection is viral and not bacterial, antibiotics are not effective. If medicine is required to treat the flu, antiviral medications are usually prescribed. However, antibiotics may be prescribed if the affected person also develops a secondary bacterial infection as a result of the flu, such as a chest infection. Q: Is there a flu vaccine? A: Yes, an annual flu vaccine is recommended for all people over the age of six months old. This vaccination, which is usually administered as an injection, protects against the most common strains of influenza each year. It is considered the best way to help prevent seasonal flu.  In certain cases, the vaccine may be administered as a nasal spray rather than a flu shot. As well as helping to prevent flu infection, the annual flu vaccine has also been shown to reduce the severity of the infection if it is still caught. Studies show that this has since resulted in a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths each year in the United States. Q: How else can the flu be prevented? A: The flu vaccine is considered the best way to help prevent seasonal flu and its potential complications. In addition to this, affected people are recommended to stay at home until around five to seven days after first becoming ill to avoid spreading the infection. Good hygiene measures, such as regularly washing hands and sneezing or coughing into a tissue, can also help to prevent the spread of influenza. Q: What is the difference between influenza A and influenza B? A: Although influenza A and B both cause similar symptoms and can be treated in the same manner, there are a number of differences between the viruses. Influenza A can affect both humans and animals and is the most common type of flu. Influenza B is less common, but the infection and symptoms experienced can be just as severe. 31 Unlike influenza A, influenza B is generally thought not to infect animals and can only be spread from human to human. Both viruses are able to evolve over time, resulting in different strains. 10 Q: Can influenza cause an epidemic? A: Yes. An epidemic is a sudden increase in cases of a disease, above what is usually expected, within a specific geographic area or community. Flu causes seasonal epidemics every year in the United States, generally during the fall or winter months and commonly peaks between December and February.  Flu can also cause a pandemic, which is an epidemic that has spread across various countries or even continents. However, influenza pandemics are rare. Q: What is seasonal flu? A: Seasonal flu is another term for an influenza infection that occurs during the typical flu season in the fall and winter months. Because the virus spreads most commonly during these months, it is recommended that people in the Northern Hemisphere receive a flu vaccine in early fall, before the season begins."

This condition mostly affects older men. The most common symptom of an inguinal hernia is a lump in the groin area, which may go away temporarily when pushed on. The diagnosis is made by a doctor examining the lump and examining the lump with an ultrasound scan of the area. As untreated hernias can sometimes cause bowel to become trapped and die, the hole in the abdominal wall is often repaired surgically. A trapped hernia is an emergency and needs urgent treatment. Surgical treatment usually works well to cure this condition.",

An inguinal hernia occurs when the intestine pokes through a hole in the abdominal wall in the groin region. This hole can occur during development before birth, or can develop over time due to age, injury or muscle weakness. Things that increase the pressure inside the abdomen can increase the risk of this condition, such as being obese, having a persistent cough, straining when opening the bowel or heavy lifting. Inguinal hernias are common. This condition is much more common among men, and tends to affect older people.",

    "condition": "Iron Deficiency (Anemia)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/",
    "what_is_iron_deficiency": "Iron deficiency refers to inadequate levels of the mineral iron in the body. The term is commonly used interchangeably with anemia: a condition often caused by iron deficiency, where the body either cannot produce a sufficient number of healthy red blood cells, or enough of the protein ( hemoglobin ) that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. However, health problems may arise before iron levels drop to the extent that anemia develops. For this reason, the terms “iron depletion” and “non-anemic iron deficiency” are sometimes also used. 1\n\nIron is a micronutrient that is vital for the healthy functioning of the body. It is an important part of the production of red blood cells, skin, hair, nails, muscles and hormones. Iron also plays a key role in the functioning of nerve cells. 2 For many people, a balanced and varied diet provides all the iron they need. Good sources of iron include liver, meat, beans, nuts, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals and dark-green leafy vegetables. However, iron deficiency is very common in both developing and developed countries, making it the most widespread nutritional disorder in the world. 4 Groups of people who are particularly at risk of developing iron deficiency include pregnant women, premenopausal women, infants, children, teenagers and the elderly. 1 5 Iron deficiency may be the result of a number of different factors and conditions. Some of the most common causes of iron deficiency are inadequate dietary intake, continuous blood loss, increased need and inadequate absorption. 1 5 Symptoms of iron deficiency do not always manifest until iron-deficiency anemia develops, but may include fatigue; paleness; dizziness; an inability to concentrate and diminished productivity; unhealthy nails, skin and hair and a painful tongue, among others. 1 5 If left untreated, iron-deficiency anemia can have serious consequences, including increased susceptibility to illness and infection, 6 pregnancy complications, impaired cognitive and physical development, heart failure and increased risk of morbidity in children. 4 However, iron deficiency is generally fairly easy to treat by addressing underlying conditions, making dietary modifications and taking supplements where necessary. 1 ref4 5",
    "iron_deficiency_symptoms": "Tiredness and a reduced ability to exercise may be experienced before anemia develops. However, signs of low iron may not be noticeable in many people until the deficiency has advanced to anemia. ref1 Even then, some people may present with few or no symptoms. 6 ref10 The severity of the symptoms typically depends on how rapidly anemia develops and the extent of the deficiency. ref9 9 People experiencing possible symptoms of iron deficiency can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nWhere present, some of the more common symptoms of iron deficiency may include: 10 6 Fatigue Difficulty concentrating on work or studies Memory problems Headaches Faintness and dizziness Breathlessness Reduced ability to exercise Pale complexion Poor condition of hair, sometimes with hair loss Brittle nails that break easily, change shape or develop ridges Slow-healing wounds Sore, inflamed tongue Sores at the corners of the mouth Restless legs syndrome Delayed development in babies\n\nSome of the less common symptoms of iron deficiency may include: 6 9 11 Itching Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) Changes in sense of taste Chest pain (usually in people where there is pre-existing heart disease) Craving or eating clay, chalk, coal, ice, paper or other non-food substances (Pica syndrome) Difficulty swallowing (very rare) Many of the symptoms of iron deficiency are nonspecific and may be indicative of other conditions. 12 10 In addition, there are a number of different types of anemia, all of which require different treatments. For this reason, it is important to consult with a medical practitioner should any of the above symptoms present.",
    "causes": "There are a number of possible causes of iron deficiency (which may lead to iron-deficiency anemia). Many of these involve different types of blood loss, which equates to the loss of cells that contain iron. An iron deficiency can result as a consequence. Causes of iron deficiency include: 9 Dietary deficiency. A diet that is lacking in iron can lead to iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. This is more common in developing countries and people who follow very restrictive diets. Menstruation. Women with heavy menstrual periods may develop iron deficiency if the amount of iron in their diet is insufficient to replace that lost during their periods. Pregnancy . Women who are pregnant require more iron than usual, and anemia often results when the levels in their diet are insufficient to support both their needs and those of the baby. Bleeding from the gut. Certain conditions can cause bleeding from the stomach and intestines. These include stomach or duodenal ulcers, inflammation of the large intestine or oesophagus, hemorrhoids and bowel cancer, among others. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin and ibuprofen can also sometimes cause bleeding. Bleeding from the kidneys. Certain conditions that affect the kidneys and bladder can cause bleeding and subsequent iron loss. Impaired absorption. Certain health conditions can impede absorption of iron from the gut. These conditions include celiac disease , infections with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori), and inflammatory bowel disease, among others. Gastric surgery may also lead to impaired absorption of iron. Parasitic infection. Hookworm infection can result in chronic blood loss and is a major cause of iron deficiency worldwide. Those living in or traveling to certain tropical countries are particularly at risk. Malaria. A relationship exists between malaria and iron deficiency in tropical parts of the world. Other possible causes of iron deficiency include blood loss from surgery, chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis , 1 cancer and overtraining in athletes. Diets very high in substances that interfere with iron absorption (for example, dairy, tea and phytates) may also be implicated in the development of iron deficiency. ref1 Heavy nosebleeds and blood donation can also lead to iron deficiency, though these potential causes may be overlooked by healthcare practitioners. 9",
    "risk_factors": "Anemia means that the body doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin to transport oxygen around the body. Iron-deficiency anemia is caused due to lack of iron and hemoglobin, which are needed for binding oxygen to the red blood cells. This condition may develop when the body does not have enough iron to make red blood cells. This condition often occurs after someone loses large amounts of blood or during pregnancy when the body needs more iron than normal. It can also occur slowly over time if a person can’t or doesn’t take in enough iron. Iron deficiency is one of the most common causes of anemia. This condition is most common in women of childbearing age.",
    "diagnosis": "After taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically request blood tests to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. 13 A blood test called a full blood count (FBC) is used to examine the number and size of the red blood cells and the amount of haemoglobin (the iron-containing molecule) in the red blood cells. The results of this test will generally indicate whether the person has anemia and what kind of anemia it may be. This can help the doctor to identify possible causes. However, because there are multiple different types and causes of anemia, further tests may be required. Other blood tests may be ordered to check the levels of ferritin in the blood – this usually provides a good indication of the total iron stores in the body. Low ferritin levels typically indicate iron deficiency. However, the results may be unreliable if there is any infection or inflammation, as well as in cases where heart failure, liver disease, cancer or hyperthyroidism is present, as these conditions may be accompanied by unusual ferritin levels. 1 If the cause of the iron deficiency is not clear, the doctor may recommend one or more of the following diagnostic tests: Fecal (stool) tests and a rectal exam to check for health conditions that may be contributing to the deficiency An endoscopy to examine the state of the stomach and intestines A colonoscopy to examine the state of the bowel and rectum An abdominal computed tomography or CT scan Blood tests and sometimes a gut biopsy (where a small piece of the small intestine is removed and sent for tests) for celiac disease Blood tests to assess thyroid , liver and kidney function Bone marrow biopsy (where a small portion of bone marrow is removed and sent for tests) The doctor may need to differentiate the diagnosis of iron deficiency from other conditions that can cause many of the same symptoms, such as thyroid disorders. People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to iron deficiency or a related condition can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "prevention": "While it is not always possible to prevent iron deficiency, people can take steps to reduce their risk of developing the condition. These include: 1 Eating a diet that contains iron-rich foods Avoiding excessive consumption of substances that can interfere with iron absorption (such as tea, coffee and cow’s milk) Taking precautions to prevent malaria when traveling to regions where the disease is prevalent Regular screening where there is a high risk of iron deficiency It is not advisable to take iron supplements unless an iron deficiency has been confirmed by a medical practitioner, as taking more iron than needed can cause side-effects and interfere with the absorption of other important minerals. Too much iron can be toxic. 5",
    "iron_deficiency_treatment": "Treatment for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia typically involves addressing the underlying cause, increasing the amount of iron in the diet and sometimes taking iron supplements. Both liquid and tablet iron supplements are available; a doctor will advise on the type and dosage required. The length of time a person needs to take an iron supplement will depend on the severity of the iron deficiency. Commonly prescribed iron supplements include ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate – all of which are equally effective. 11 All iron supplements can be toxic in high doses, and should be kept out of reach of children. Iron supplements may cause unpleasant side-effects, including nausea, stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhea and constipation. 11 Taking lower doses or taking the supplement with meals can help to reduce the likelihood and severity of these side-effects. 2 A doctor may advise taking the iron supplement with orange juice or vitamin C to enhance absorption of the mineral. 13 Not all cases of iron deficiency will require treatment with a medical supplement. If the deficiency is mild, it may be sufficient to take a natural supplement like a highly concentrated juice made from plants that are rich in iron. Some people may find this kind of supplement more palatable and easier to take on a regular basis. A person with iron deficiency will typically start to feel better within a few days of starting their treatment program. They will usually be asked to have follow-up blood tests a few weeks later to confirm that the treatment is working. Even after their iron levels have returned to the normal range, the treatment will usually continue for another three months or more, and the person will be asked to have regular blood tests to ensure that they do not develop iron deficiency again. Unless the iron deficiency is related to a serious underlying health condition, the treatment is usually effective. 6",
    "iron_deficiency_faqs": "Q: Can iron deficiency cause hair loss? A: Yes, iron deficiency can cause hair loss. The condition can also result in the hair, skin and nails appearing in a poor condition. 1 Q: Are vegetarians at greater risk of iron deficiency? A: While iron found in some plant sources can be difficult to absorb, eating a well-balanced vegetarian diet is generally sufficient to prevent deficiency. The incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in vegetarians has not been found to differ greatly from non-vegetarians. However, poor or restrictive vegetarian diets may increase the risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia. 14 It is recommended that those following a vegan diet – young women in particular – have their iron status checked regularly and take supplements where necessary. 15 Q: What is latent iron deficiency? A: Also known as depleted iron stores, latent iron deficiency refers to a lack of iron that may not be severe enough to cause anemia, but could cause other health problems. 1"

    "what_is_irritable_bowel_syndrome": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder affecting bowel function, characterized by symptoms mostly relating to digestive discomfort, including diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas, cramping, and abdominal pain . IBS affects around 11 % of the population globally. In Western countries, such as the U.S., women are significantly more likely to be affected by IBS than men, but this ratio varies dramatically worldwide; in India, for example, between 80% and 90% of those affected are male. People with a family history of irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to develop the condition than those without. 1\n\nDifferent people will experience different combinations of the possible symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus requiring varying treatments . Diagnosis of IBS will involve identifying triggers of its symptoms, which are usually gastrointestinal and related to a person’s diet and lifestyle so that a person’s exposure to triggers that activate irritable bowel syndrome can be minimized as part of their treatment plan. IBS can be a long-term condition requiring careful management . The improvement of a person’s digestive health is often brought about by a combination of lifestyle and diet changes designed to reduce bloating, constipation, diarrhea, and other symptoms they may be experiencing. Changes to a person’s diet may involve adopting a low FODMAP diet; a diet low in fermentable short-chain carbohydrates. See IBS and diet . Pharmaceutical interventions may be used to treat chronic (persistent) cases of IBS. Irritable bowel syndrome does not cause inflammation or permanent damage such as bleeding or ulcers, nor an increased risk of cancers.",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs_vs_inflammatory_bowel_disease_ibd": "Both IBS and IBD are conditions which affect the gastrointestinal tract , which is part of the digestive system. Though the symptoms of IBS and IBD can be similar, including abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea and abdominal cramping, IBD is a more serious condition. Inflammatory bowel diseases are a group of conditions in which the body’s own immune system attacks parts of the digestive system in the gastrointestinal tract. This group includes chronic diseases such as ulcerative colitis, which affects the large intestine, and Crohn’s disease, which can affect the entire digestive tract , damaging both the surface and the deep tissues of the intestines. 2 In contrast, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only affects the function and behavior of the intestines. IBS is not an autoimmune condition. Although IBD does not cause IBS, those affected by IBD have a greater likelihood of developing IBS than the general population. In contrast, having IBS does not impact a person’s likelihood of developing IBD. 2",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs_symptoms": "Different kinds of IBS are diagnosed according to their symptoms, with people experiencing different combinations of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, including bloating, diarrhea, constipation and painful abdominal cramps . People with IBS may suffer from diarrhea or constipation or both, either at the same time or at alternating times. 3\n\nAbdominal pain and cramping, particularly felt in the lower belly, is one of the most common symptoms of IBS. Abdominal cramps can be caused by constipation or diarrhea, other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. They typically increase after meals. For some people affected by IBS, having a bowel movement (BM) can intensify pain and cramping; for others, having a BM can reduce these symptoms.\n\nSome people experience diarrhea as a main symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, passing loose, watery stools more than three times per day. In people with IBS, diarrhea may occur suddenly, particularly after encountering triggers of their symptoms. In cases of irritable bowel syndrome in which a person experiences diarrhea as one of their most prominent symptoms, the condition is sometimes called IBS-D . Altering a person’s diet is the first-line treatment for IBS-D, followed by prescribing medications. 4\n\nThose experiencing constipation as a symptom of IBS may pass fewer than threebowel movements per week. When it is passed, stool is often small and hard. When a person experiences constipation as one of the principal symptoms of their irritable bowel syndrome, this is sometimes called IBS-C . 5\n\nWhen a person is equally affected by constipation and diarrhea as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, this is called IBS-M (mixed irritable bowel syndrome) or IBS-A (alternating irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nRectal tenesmus involves cramping and spasms in the rectum . This leads to feeling that a bowel movement is incomplete, even if the bowel has actually been evacuated successfully. This feeling may lead to abdominal pain and cramping, associated with straining to bring about a bowel movement.\n\nMany people with IBS experience intense bloating (a sensation of increased abdominal pressure). This may or may not be due to an increased quantity of gas in the gastrointestinal tract; about 50 % of people experience increased abdominal pressure without a buildup of gas. 6 Some people with irritable bowel syndrome also experience increased burping.\n\nPassing mucus in the stool is a common symptom of IBS, but passing blood may indicate a more serious condition affecting the bowel, colon or gastrointestinal tract. Always seek medical attention for a prompt diagnosis if blood is present in bowel movements. People experiencing any possible symptoms of IBS can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Despite ongoing research to determine definitive causes of IBS, these are still unclear. Contributing factors may include infection, neurohormonal factors, food sensitivities and bacterial overgrowth. An individual’s psychological condition, hormone changes or stress levels are other possible causes.\n\nIt has been observed that some patients experience their first IBS symptoms after acute infectious enteritis. This so-called postinfectious IBS may be caused by viral, bacterial, protozoan or helminth infection. Several research studies have shown that IBS symptoms can increase after infectious enteritis, but the actual cause of these symptoms requires further research.\n\nSome people experience visceral hypersensitivity , which is a greater sensitivity to pain from the organs, including the stretching of the bowel as gas or stool passes through it. This may be linked to IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain, urgent bowel movements, and bloating. However, the cause of this hypersensitivity is unknown. 7 It is also possible that the brain of a person with IBS processes pain differently than that of an unaffected person or that other differences in the signals passed between the brain and the intestinal tract are related to IBS. 8 Neurotransmitters or reproductive hormones may be imbalanced in some people with IBS, and these may be affected by changes to an individual’s hormones, such as throughout the menstrual cycle. The possible role of sexual hormones in IBS may be supported by the fact that roughly twice as many women as men are affected in some countries. 9\n\nIt has been observed that an individual with IBS may experience symptoms more often due to an intolerance of foods such as wheat; dairy products; fatty, creamy or fried foods; alliums such as garlic or onions; stone fruits and other kinds of fruit; brassicae such as cabbage, cauliflower or Brussels sprouts; pulses such as lentils or beans and chili peppers. Eliminating certain foods from the diet has been shown by some dietary studies to relieve the symptoms of IBS, but these foods vary according to the individual. More research on food sensitivities and their effect on IBS is required.\n\nSmall intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is when too many of the gut’s naturally occurring bacteria accumulate in the small intestine. Some research has linked SIBO to IBS, and that antibiotic treatment has decreased IBS symptoms in some people with SIBO. 10 It is not clear from this research whether antibiotics affect the SIBO directly or affect the IBS in a different manner.\n\nIn some people, IBS symptoms can be caused by the digestive system failing to absorb fructose effectively . Fructose is a kind of sugar found in fruits and some vegetables, and is often used as an artificial sweetener in processed foods. When fructose is not absorbed properly by the digestive system, it can ferment in the colon (large intestine). This can result in gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, bloating and diarrhea. For people whose IBS is believed to result from malabsorption of fructose, eating foods which are low in fructose may be helpful in reducing their symptoms. See this resource from the University of Virginia’s Digestive Health Centre for more information on low-fructose foods .\n\nIBS is often linked to psychological factors such as stress, anxiety or depression, and stress management is one possible treatment tool. Genetics may play a role in the development of IBS, but there is limited evidence to support this.",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_ibs_diagnosis": "A diagnosis of IBS is usually made by considering recurrence of symptoms over a period of 3 to 6 months rather than solely through a physical examination or by visual inspection of the bowel during colonoscopy. To assist doctors in making a diagnosis, a person may keep a diary of their diet and gastrointestinal symptoms during this period to identify factors that may be triggering their possible IBS. Although it does not form the sole basis of a diagnosis of IBS, a colonoscopy may still be performed as part of an IBS diagnosis to help rule out other issues. This is an imaging procedure in which the colon or large intestine is visualized by inserting a thin, flexible tube containing a camera into the body through the rectum. See this resource on preparing for a colonoscopy for more information. Other possible measures which may be used in making a potential diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome include a blood or stool test , flexible sigmoidoscopy or a barium series. 11 People experiencing possible symptoms of IBS can also use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_treatment": "Treatments for IBS include:\n\nLifestyle changes addressing diet or stress are usually the first approach to IBS treatment.\n\nAddressing generalized stress and anxiety is a common treatment approach. Some people experience anxiety around their IBS symptoms (known as GI symptom-specific anxiety), and may limit their exposure to activities and situations that would be affected by their IBS. This can increase their anxiety, creating a vicious cycle that increases their symptoms. Therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, and hypnotherapy may be used to help individuals both manage general stress and break this cycle. Self-care to manage stress is another option, with common techniques including meditation, yoga and exercise.\n\nEach person has different dietary triggers for IBS . If sensitivity to specific foods is a trigger for IBS symptoms, treatment may include reducing or eliminating these foods from the diet. Many people find it helpful to avoid high-FODMAP foods; FODMAP stands for: Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols; fermentable short-chain carbohydrates which are prevalent in a regular diet, which the small intestine does not absorb very well. 12 Examples of low FODMAP foods which may ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when included in a person’s diet include: 12 Lactose-free or low-lactose dairy products, such as non-dairy milks, hard cheeses such as cheddar Low-fructose fruits such as oranges, kiwis and strawberries Low-fructan vegetables such as bean sprouts, carrots, eggplant, potatoes, olives, turnips Protein such as lean meat and tofu Gluten-free grains Examples of high FODMAP foods, which may aggravate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and should be excluded from one’s diet where possible, include: 12 Lactose - cow’s milk, yogurt, and cream Fructose - fruits and products high in natural sugars from fruit, such as apples, pears, peaches, corn syrup Fructans - vegetables and grains high in fructans include artichokes, garlic, onions, broccoli, beetroot, and grains such as wheat and rye Polyols - sweeteners such as sorbitol and xylitol, found in sugar-free products Another approach to alleviating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome by changing one’s diet is to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Eating more slowly can reduce gas and bloating . Along with an individual’s possible food intolerances, foods commonly associated with abdominal cramping or diarrhea include coffee, caffeine, alcohol or high-fat foods, as well as poorly-digested sugars, such as sorbitol or fructose. Beans, raisins, or bread can cause gas, and lactose intolerance can trigger IBS symptoms. Eating a high-fiber diet can improve stool quality and keep the GI tract healthy, but a diet excessively high in fiber can also cause gas and diarrhea.",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_medications": "Medications are available to treat moderate to severe IBS. These include:\n\nIf diarrhea is present with IBS, over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medications like loperamide (Imodium) are often used. Common prescriptions drugs used to treat it include diphenoxylate (Lomotil, Lomocot) and atropine.\n\nAntispasmodic medications such as dicyclomine (Bentyl) and hyoscyamine (Levsin), as well asanticholinergic medications, are commonly prescribed to decrease painful abdominal spasms. Smooth muscle relaxants, such as alverine, mebeverine and peppermint oil may also be used.\n\nPeople affected by IBS who also have depression may be prescribed selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) or paroxetine (Paxil), as well astricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline (Pamelor), imipramine (Tofranil) ordesipramine (Norpramin). People with IBS who do not experience depression may be also prescribed antidepressants due to their effect on the connection between the brain and gut.\n\nAn imbalance in the normal bacteria (gut flora) living in the human gut can affect its function and overall wellness, and probiotic supplements can introduce healthy, normal bacteria . More research is needed to prove their overall effectiveness, but some IBS sufferers do gain relief from probiotic supplements, with Bifidobacteriuminfantis the most commonly studied probiotic. Some IBS may be associated with overgrowth or infection of harmful bacteria in the gut, and antibiotic medications that reduce bacteria are a possible treatment. The antibiotic Xifaxan (Rifaximin) may be used to treat this kind of IBS.",
    "other_names_for_irritable_bowel_syndrome": "Spastic colon",
    "irritable_bowel_syndrome_faqs": "Q: Is it IBS, IBD, Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis? A: IBS is often confused with IBD. While symptoms may be similar, IBD causes inflammatory damage to the intestines, but IBS does not. People with IBS who pass bloody stool, lose weight or experience extreme cramping should go to a doctor to be evaluated for IBD or another serious condition. Q: Can IBS cause cancer? Is IBS fatal? A: IBS does not increase the risk of colon or other cancers, and it's not fatal. Q: Can IBS be cured? A: As symptoms of IBS and their treatments vary from person to person, there's no single cure for IBS. However, individuals can manage their symptoms to minimize their effects on daily life and activities, sometimes ending their symptoms entirely. Q: Is medication necessary for IBS? A: Many cases of IBS can be controlled through lifestyle and dietary changes, under a doctor’s advice."

    "condition": "Ischemic Stroke",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/ischemic-stroke/",
    "what_is_an_ischemic_stroke": "Ischemic stroke occurs most often when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is blocked or obstructed by a blood clot or fatty deposit or any mix thereof. The brain relies on a constant supply of blood to provide it with oxygen and nutrients and to carry away carbon dioxide. When the blood flow, and therefore this supply, becomes interrupted or blocked, brain cells can quickly begin to stop working. If the blockage lasts for more than a couple of minutes, these cells can die, leading to serious damage to the brain. Depending on the location and supply area of the affected vessel, the damage can range from mildly debilitating to severe or life-threatening. There are two main types of stroke: the ischemic one introduced above, and the hemorrhagic one . Ischemic stroke is the most common, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases in the United States. 2 If prompt treatment is received, the effects of a stroke can be managed in many cases. However, in some cases, ischemic stroke can lead to long-term disability and mortality, i.e. a person dying because of the condition.",
    "symptoms": "In most cases, the symptoms of an ischemic stroke will appear suddenly, within seconds or minutes. Because people experiencing a stroke require immediate treatment, it is important to be aware of the immediate signs and symptoms and take action without delay. A useful acronym for remembering the signs and symptoms of an ischemic stroke is FAST: 4 F ace. Weakness or drooping of the face, usually limited to or more pronounced on one side. A rm. Numbness, weakness or strange sensations, e.g. pins and needles, in one or both arms. S peech. Difficulty speaking or slurred speech, mumbling or not being able to speak at all. T ime to call the emergency services. The sooner an ambulance is called, the better the chances of a successful recovery. Other symptoms of ischemic stroke may include: 5 Weakness or numbness on one side of the body Difficulty walking or getting up, e.g. from a chair or out of bed Dropping to the floor Headache Dizziness Sudden, new tinnitus – a ringing, swishing or whooshing sound in the ears Nausea and vomiting Soreness in the neck or face Vision problems, i.e. double vision or an inability to see parts of one’s surrounding or anything at all Confusion, sudden sleepiness, difficulty waking up Sudden urinary incontinence, newly occurring with other symptoms The symptoms that are experienced will depend on what part of the brain is affected and may vary in severity from person to person.",
    "causes": "Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel of the brain becomes blocked. This can happen as a result of several different conditions, including: 2 5 Most commonly: Atherosclerosis Small vessel disease Atrial fibrillation (AFib ) In rarer cases: Arterial dissection, e.g. due to trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia Certain blood clotting problems called coagulopathies, e.g. polycythemia or as a result of hormonal medications Inflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis, e.g. giant cell arteritis Sickle cell disease\n\nA condition occurring when fatty deposits – called plaques or atheromas –  build up on the walls of the arteries, causing them to become narrower, harder and more easily blocked. Read more about Atherosclerosis »\n\nSmall vessel disease involves the collection of deposits within the small blood vessels of the brain. As these deposits develop, the blood vessels become harder and can eventually become completely blocked. It occurs primarily as a result of high blood pressure and diabetes . 5\n\nAtrial fibrillation is a type of irregular heartbeat that can cause blood clots in the heart. These then enter the bloodstream and reach other parts of the body, e.g. the brain. If this happens, ischemic stroke can result.\n\nArterial dissection is a rarer cause of stroke. The condition occurs when tears in the lining of the arteries develop and blood is able to get in between the different layers of the artery wall. As blood builds up, a blood clot can form and lead to a stroke.\n\nThough uncommon, certain blood clotting problems, where the blood clots too quickly, may cause a stroke. One example is polycythemia vera, a rare condition where the body produces too many red blood cells. This causes blood clots to form more easily – potentially leading to an ischemic stroke. 7\n\nThis is the term for an inflammation in the blood vessels, which may develop as the result of an infection, another health condition or an adverse reaction to medication. Vasculitis may cause the blood vessels to narrow or even become blocked, potentially leading to an ischemic stroke. 8 One type of vasculitis is giant cell arteritis, a condition that affects the arteries in the head and upper part of the body. 9\n\nThis genetic condition causes the shape of red blood cells to be abnormal. These red blood cells do not last very long, leading to anemia, and they can also block blood vessels – potentially leading to a stroke. 10 11 Read more about Sickle Cell Disease »",
    "ischemic_stroke_risk_factors": "There are a number of factors which can increase a person’s likelihood of experiencing an ischemic stroke. These include factors which a person themselves or treatment can change over time, and factors that cannot be changed. 4 5 Factors that can be changed over time (modifiable factors) include: 5 High blood pressure - this is the strongest single risk factor for the development of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke Atherosclerosis (fatty deposits in the arteries) Hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels in the blood) Diabetes Obesity and physical inactivity Stress High alcohol consumption Tobacco use Illicit (illegal) drug use Cardiovascular (heart and heart vessel) diseases Blood clotting disorders Oral contraceptives (birth control pills) Postmenopausal hormone intake Factors that cannot be changed over time (non-modifiable factors) include: 5 Being over the age of 40 Being male Ethnicity - African Americans, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Hispanic people are at higher risk Family history of stroke, heart or heart vessel conditions Genetic disorders, e.g. sickle cell disease Recent childbirth also leads to a somewhat increased risk of stroke, due to an increased risk of blood clotting problems. Although the above factors may make a stroke more likely, people who do not possess any risk factors may also experience a stroke.",
    "diagnosing_ischemic_stroke": "Anyone displaying any signs of stroke should immediately be taken to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis. Typically, this will first involve a physical examination, that may include an ECGto rule out atrial fibrillation and a review of the person’s medical history, before a number of other scans and tests. 4\n\nBrain scans can help establish whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic, as well as its severity and the part of the brain affected. CT and MRI scans are the most commonly used types of scans for people suspected of having a stroke. 12 5 CT scans allow doctors to create a 3D image of the brain, enabling them to see what section of the brain is being affected and whether a stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. A CT scan is, in general, the best option (gold standard) and is quicker than an MRI scan. However, it may not be able to detect blood vessel blockages in the very early stages. Within the first 30 minutes of the blockage, an MRI will most likely produce more reliable results. MRI scans use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. In the first 30 minutes from the onset of stroke symptoms, an MRI may be able to detect blood vessel blockages and stroke damage more accurately than a CT scan. Brain scans should be carried out as quickly as humanly possible when the person reaches the hospital, allowing for prompt and appropriate treatment to be received.\n\nVarious heart and blood vessel tests can be used to establish the cause of a stroke. Two of the most common are carotid ultrasound and echocardiography. Carotid ultrasound is able to identify any blockages or clots in the arteries running along the neck and leading to the brain. Echocardiography is a kind of ultrasound that can produce a detailed picture and provide certain measurements of the heart, enabling doctors to locate any issues that may have contributed to the stroke.",
    "ischemic_stroke_treatment": "The aim of treatment for ischemic stroke is to restore blood flow as quickly as possible to the affected area of the brain. This will usually involve a combination of different medications while the person is being treated in the hospital and possibly others, once they are at home or at a rehabilitation facility. Some of these will only need to be taken for a short period of time, while others may be used to prevent future recurrences of stroke and will require long-term use. 13 14 Some of the most commonly prescribed medications for treating an ischemic stroke include: Alteplase: A type of medication used to dissolve clots and restore blood flow to the brain. Alteplase is most effective when administered as soon as possible after the stroke has taken place. It will most often be given through a drip into a person’s veins, from where it will spread through the entire blood vessel system. Sometimes, the medication has to be given directly into an artery, close to the obstruction - this procedure is then called intra-arterial thrombolysis. Alteplase can only be used for ischemic strokes, not if there is bleeding into the brain - as in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke. To confirm that the stroke is indeed ischemic in nature, alteplase can only be prescribed following a brain scan. Antiplatelets: This type of medication helps to prevent further clots from forming. Aspirin is the most common antiplatelet, as well as a painkiller, though others, such as clopidogrel and dipyridamole, are also sometimes used. Anticoagulants: This type of medication, sometimes called blood thinners, includes drugs like warfarin or heparin and can be used to help reduce the chances of a stroke recurring by preventing blood clots from forming. Anticoagulants are sometimes also used in the acute treatment of a stroke.\n\nIn some cases, usually those involving a blood clot in one of the brain’s larger arteries, a procedure known as a mechanical thrombectomy may be used. During a thrombectomy, a catheter is inserted into the affected artery, through which a device, known as a stent retriever, is able to remove the clot in the artery in the brain. The procedure can be done under general or local anesthetic and is most effective when carried out shortly after the stroke has taken place. The procedure will usually be carried out in addition to IV thrombolytic therapy, e.g. with alteplase.",
    "ischemic_stroke_complications": "A number of complications can arise in the days and weeks after a person has experienced a stroke, either while they are still in hospital or once they are at home or in a rehabilitation facility. These complications are important to recognize and treat in a timely manner, as they can, in some cases, lead to serious health problems and mortality (people dying from the condition). Some of the most common complications include: 5\n\nWhile recovering from ischemic stroke, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots due to lack of moving around. This can be especially serious if a clot develops in the deep veins of the leg (deep vein thrombosis), breaks off and travels to the lungs. This can result in a condition known as pulmonary embolus or embolism, which can be potentially fatal. Older age and a lack of mobility during the recovery period increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis. Doctors and physical therapists will advise on how to help prevent the development of blood clots. This may include the use of intermittent pneumatic compression devices, i.e. an inflatable sleeve that is wrapped around the legs, helping to increase circulation, compression stockings  and anticoagulant medication. People recovering from a stroke are also encouraged to move around frequently.\n\nDysphagia refers to difficulty swallowing. This can occur after a stroke due to problems coordinating between the muscles of the tongue, mouth and throat. Dysphagia results in an increased risk of inhaling saliva or food into the lungs, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a condition that can worsen the prognosis of people who have had a stroke. To determine whether a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing, doctors will typically perform a water test. This involves swallowing a small amount of water while being monitored. If dysphagia is suspected, people may be temporarily fed through a drip into the veins, a nasogastric feeding tube or, in rarer cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. Further details are provided below.\n\nPeople recovering from a stroke often experience difficulty consuming enough calories. This can prolong the recovery period and in some cases lead to long-term disability. If it is suspected that a person will not be able consume enough calories themselves, a type of feeding tube known as a nasogastric tube (NGT)may be fitted through the nose. Through this tube, food and necessary nutrients can be supplied directly to the stomach as a short-term solution. In some cases, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube may need to be fitted through the abdomen (belly) as a longer-term feeding solution.\n\nUrinary tract infections are a common complication of a stroke. This is generally because people in recovery often experience difficulty with getting out of bed to urinate, bladder leakage and problems fully emptying their bladders. Depending on the type of stroke, temporary use of a catheter may be recommended to decrease the risk of urinary tract infection. However, the use of a catheter comes with its own risk of urinary tract infection, meaning most people are advised to only use a catheter when necessary and to change the catheter regularly.\n\nHeart abnormalities seem to be quite common in people who have had a stroke. Though often difficult to do so, in the interests of effective care, it is important to identify whether the heart problems led to the stroke, resulted from the stroke, or are entirely unrelated, and treat them accordingly to minimize the risk of further complications. Through an electrocardiogram, blood tests and monitoring, doctors are able to determine the potential risk of heart problems and recommend appropriate treatment options. 17\n\nBed sores are common in people recovering from a stroke due to the large amount of time spent in bed. Bed sores can vary in severity from mild redness to deep sores extending down to the bone. Bed sores can cause severe irritation and increase the risk of infection. Frequent movement, which may need to be assisted, is recommended to prevent the development of bed sores. Care should also be taken to avoid pressure on sensitive areas such as the knees, ankles and heels.\n\nPeople recovering from a stroke may experience difficulty walking. Lack of movement can increase the risk of bone thinning and muscle weakness, which can in turn increase the chances of falling and breaking a bone. To help prevent this, people will often be encouraged to partake in muscle strengthening exercises and rehabilitation appropriate to their condition.",
    "ischemic_stroke_prevention": "Although some of the risk factors of a stroke – such as family history and being over the age of 40 – are uncontrollable, other risk factors can be managed to help decrease the chances of a stroke. These risk factors include: 18 High blood pressure: If a person’s blood pressure is outside the normal range, steps can be taken to help bring it down. These steps may include maintaining a healthy weight, exercising and eating healthily. If these measures are not sufficient and it is deemed necessary by a medical professional, taking appropriate medication against hypertension may also be recommended. Smoking: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of stroke. Doctors and specialists are able to recommend supportive measures, e.g. structured programs and/or medications to help people quit. Heart problems: Heart disorders, such as coronary artery disease and irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), increase the risk of stroke. People with such a heart problem should seek medical attention. Treatment for these heart problems will help reduce the chances of stroke. Diabetes: Receiving proper treatment for diabetes type 2, as well as type 1, is helpful in preventing a stroke. Obesity/inactivity: A sedentary, inactive and nutritionally unhealthy lifestyle leading to obesity is strongly linked to heart problems, diabetes and high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight and leading an active lifestyle is an effective way of helping to prevent a stroke.",
    "ischemic_stroke_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between an ischemic stroke and a hemorrhagic stroke? A: An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel leading to the brain becomes blocked or obstructed. This is the most common type of stroke, accounting for roughly 85 percent of all cases.

    "condition": "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis/",
    "what_is_juvenile_idiopathic_arthritis": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or juvenile chronic arthritis, is a chronic inflammatory condition primarily affecting the joints. It occurs in children under 16 years old. Learn about types of arthritis occuring in adults here . There are different types of JIA with varying symptoms and degrees of likelihood that a child will grow out of the condition. All types of JIA involve pain, swelling and stiffness of one or more joints. JIA is an autoimmune reaction. This means that the immune system forms antibodies – proteins which ordinarily are meant to fight infections – that, in these cases, attack the body tissue. The causes are not well understood, but factors such as genetics and infections may influence the development of JIA. Treatment often involves taking medications that suppress the immune system to a degree. Many children with the condition live well with treatment, and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many cases of JIA will resolve, though it is not possible to accurately predict this. In about 30 percent of cases, JIA can remain active into adult life. 1 JIA is the most common autoimmune joint condition in children. It tends to affect children younger than 10 but does not generally affect those younger than 6 months old. Girls are more commonly affected than boys and tend to show symptoms at a younger age.",
    "symptoms": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is characterized by joint inflammation over a period of six weeks or more. Symptoms of inflammation in the joints include: 2 3 Swelling Stiffness Pain Sensation of heat Redness Symptoms may develop slowly or abruptly, often with increased stiffness in the morning or following inactivity. Less common signs and symptoms of JIA may include: 2 3 Rash on the torso, arms or legs, which quickly fades or changes Fever, often spiking once or twice each day at about the same time Anemia Limping Not using or a reluctance to use a certain limb Loss of motor skill function General pain Fatigue Sleep problems Swollen lymph nodes Weight loss and a reduced appetite Psoriasis or other skin abnormalities Uveitis – inflammation of the eyes Growth disturbances leading to limb length discrepancy The joints that are most commonly affected in JIA are the wrists, knees and ankles, but other joints can also be involved, such as the knuckles of the fingers. Wondering whether you or a child in your care may be experiencing juvenile idiopathic arthritis? Try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",
    "types": "There are six defined types of JIA, with diagnostic criteria varying according to certain factors, which include: 1 2 Number of joints affected in the first six months Presence of laboratory markers in the blood that are typical of autoimmune diseases Symptoms present in other areas of the body In about 1 to 10 percent of cases of JIA, the arthritis may not fit into any of the types listed below, in which case it is called undifferentiated arthritis. JIA may be classified as one of the following six subtypes: Oligoarticular JIA: Formerly known as pauciarticular JRA or pauciarthritis, this is the most common type of JIA, making up about half of all cases. Diagnosis may be made if between one and four joints are affected in the first six months. This type of JIA is the most likely to resolve, leaving little or no joint damage. The condition is known as persistent oligoarthritis if it continues affecting up to four joints after six months, or known as extended oligoarthritis if it affects more than six joints after six months. Oligoarticular JIA commonly affects one or both knees and is often mild. It is also the type of JIA most likely to cause uveitis – eye inflammation – so requires regular eye checks. Polyarticular JIA: rheumatoid factor negative: This accounts for about a quarter of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis of polyarthritis may be made if five or more joints are affected in the first six months. Rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA is diagnosed if a blood test for rheumatoid factor (RF) is also negative. It may involve tiredness and occasional, slight fever. This type of JIA may remain into adult life, but can go into remission, where the condition is symptomless. However, there is a remaining high risk of physical impairments. Polyarticular JIA: rheumatoid factor positive: This accounts for about 5 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if five or more joints are affected in the first six months and a blood test for rheumatoid factor (RF) is positive. It may involve tiredness and occasional, slight fever. This type of JIA may remain into adult life, but can go into remission, where the condition is symptomless. It tends to persist and has an increased risk of rapid progressive destruction of affected joints. Systemic onset JIA, also known as Still’s disease or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: This accounts for about 5 to 10 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if there is arthritis in one or more joints with, or preceded by, fever of at least two weeks' duration, and if one or more of the following signs and symptoms are present: Swollen glands in neck, armpits and groin Quickly fading rash Increased liver and/or spleen size Pericarditis: : inflammation of the heart lining; pleuritis: inflammation of the lungs; or peritonitis: inflammation of the abdomen There may be no joint symptoms in the first few weeks. The outlook for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis may be difficult to predict. Any fever or rash usually settles, and arthritis may continue for several years before settling. Juvenile psoriatic arthritis: This accounts for about 2 to 15 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if arthritis occurs with psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, or if arthritis occurs with at least two of the following factors: Inflammation of toe or finger Indentation on the nails Painless separation of the nail from the nail bed A first-degree relative with psoriasis The outlook for juvenile psoriatic arthritis may be difficult to predict. In about 30 to 40 percent of cases, the condition remains into adulthood. This type of JIA usually has a mild course of disease. Enthesitis-related arthritis: This accounts for about 2 to 10 percent of all cases of JIA. Diagnosis may be made if arthritis occurs with enthesitis – inflammation of the enthesis, the connective tissue between tendons or ligaments and bone – or if arthritis occurs with two or more of the following factors: Pain in lower back Positive HLA-B27 test: a marker of certain conditions Other HLA-B27-associated conditions present, such as ankylosing spondylitis: spine inflammation; uveitis : inflammation of the eye; or ulcerative colitis : inflammation of the large intestine Family history of HLA-B27-associated conditions Child is male and older than six years This type of JIA usually has a mild course of disease.",
    "causes": "It is not completely understood what causes JIA; the definition of the term “idiopathic” is “of unknown cause”. It is known that juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means that it is caused by abnormal functioning of the immune system. In a normally-functioning immune system, the body attacks foreign bacteria and viruses. In the case of autoimmune disease, the body accidentally attacks its own healthy tissue. In JIA, the body attacks its joint tissue. Children with JIA produce an excess of white blood cells in the synovial membrane, the tissue that lines the cavities of joints; this causes inflammation. Occasionally, inflammation can also occur in other associated parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart and eyes.",
    "risk_factors": "There are three main risk factors for JIA: 4 5 Children aged 2 to 3 years old have the highest risk of JIA. It rarely occurs in babies younger than six months. Generally, girls are more than twice as likely as boys to develop JIA, but this may vary depending on the particular subtype. Genetic factors are involved in the risk of developing JIA. However, JIA is not solely genetic and is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and other factors from the environment, such as infection, though thus far research has been limited in this area.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of JIA is generally made after referral to a pediatric rheumatologist, a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles or fibrous tissues of children. To be classified as JIA, the signs and symptoms of the condition must occur before the age of 16 and persist for a minimum of six weeks. 1 There is no specific test for JIA. A pediatric rheumatologist will gather information to rule out other conditions and home in on the cause of the patient’s symptoms. Initially, diagnosis will be attempted from reported medical history, symptoms and a physical examination. Where this does not yield a definite diagnosis, further laboratory tests and medical imaging may be used. Good to know: Keeping a diary of symptoms may be helpful in making the diagnosis. Try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.\n\nThe purpose of a physical examination is to look for early signs and symptoms of JIA. Although it is rare for two or more members of the same family to be diagnosed with JIA, it is still important for doctors to look at one’s family medical history for any signs of predisposition to the condition. Doctors will pay particular attention to whether any family members have experienced an autoimmune disorder of any kind, as this may increase the chances of JIA.\n\nIf a doctor suspects JIA, one or more blood tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. Tests may include the following: 6 7 Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), which are proteins that recognize parts of the body’s own cells as something the body needs to fight in an autoimmune reaction. These are sometimes found in children with JIA, as well as in other autoimmune diseases and in children with a family history of autoimmune diseases. ANAs are also found in some healthy children. Complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panel, which is a blood test used to look at all types of blood cells to determine how many there are and what they look like, in order to detect anything unusual and diagnose many medical conditions. Anemia – low levels of healthy red blood cells – is common in children with JIA. Lower levels of white blood cells may be a sign of JIA or other inflammatory conditions, or a reaction to certain medicines. Inflammatory markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) and C-reactive protein (CRP) tests may be done as these may show whether there is inflammation and to what degree. However, these markers are not always present alongside inflammation. HLA-B27, which is a protein on the surface of white blood cells; it is genetically inherited and has been linked with some types of JIA. Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies, which are proteins that attack healthy tissues. These are occasionally found in children with JIA. Good to know: If it is possible that symptoms may be caused by an infection within a joint, then fluid may be drawn out from the joint with a needle and sent for laboratory testing. Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nA doctor may also recommend an X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected joint to help with diagnosis. 3 However, at an early stage of JIA, any characteristic damage caused by the condition may not yet be apparent.",
    "treatment": "The main aims of treatment for JIA are: To prevent joint damage To minimize pain and other symptoms, and maintain quality of life To prevent the development of associated conditions, such as growth problems, osteoporosis , puberty delay and reduced vision\n\nMedications to treat JIA are usually prescribed by a pediatric rheumatologist. There are four main types of JIA drugs that are used: 2 Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , such as ibuprofen, offer pain relief and reduce minor inflammation. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) work by suppressing the overactive chemicals released by the immune system, which can damage nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. These are usually administered by mouth. Biological response modifiers work by targeting the immune system and modifying the molecules causing the inflammation. This type of medication is generally reserved for the treatment of those who have not responded to DMARDs. They are usually administered through injection. Steroids quickly improve inflammation. It is important that steroids are used judiciously in children and are tapered as soon as possible. The younger the child, the more a clinician will try to avoid this substance group. They may be used in several ways, including being: Taken orally to improve inflammation symptoms when these are present in other parts of the body, such as the heart lining, lungs and abdomen. This is only done rarely because of the risk of side effects, such as osteoporosis and growth impairments. Absorbed through eye drops in the case of eye inflammation. Injected into affected joints.\n\nChildren should be encouraged to participate in as much physical activity as possible. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy programmes can be helpful in maintaining strong joints and increasing the child’s ability to do normal activities. Other treatments and lifestyle changes may include: 7 Nutrition counseling Regular eye exams to find and treat any eye inflammation early Making sure to get enough sleep Good to know: Children with JIA may experience emotional, behavioral and academic difficulties due to being unable to participate in all physical activities and time spent away from school for hospital appointments and admissions. Therefore, children with JIA and their families may need support for these areas.",
    "complications": "There are several complications of JIA, which may or may not affect a child, depending on the type of JIA they have, how severe it is and how well-managed. Complications can affect various parts of the body, including bones, joints, muscles and eyes. Complications may include: 9 Growth problems, which may include misshapen body parts, uneven limb lengths or slow growth overall, due to inflammation leading to abnormal bone formation or from steroids. Keeping JIA flare ups under control is the best way to avoid growth problems. Osteoporosis – bone thinning and weakening – which makes bones likely to fracture, may occur due to not staying active, not getting enough calcium or as a result of steroid treatment. Staying active as well as taking calcium and vitamin D supplements can help prevent osteoporosis. Joint contractures, in which muscles and tendons do not grow properly and become stuck in a bent position, having been kept in this position to avoid discomfort due to inflammation. Regular stretching and use of splints can reduce joint tightness. Muscle weakness and muscle loss, caused by abstaining from physical activities due to stiffness and pain. Regular exercise as recommended by a physiotherapist can help prevent muscle problems such as these. Eye problems, such as uveitis – eye inflammation; glaucoma – optic nerve damage due to pressure of the fluid inside the eye; or cataracts – a clouding of the lens . A child with JIA should receive regular checks from an eye doctor to monitor for any eye problems before they create further damage. Inflammation of other parts of the body, such as pericarditis – inflammation of the heart membrane, pleuritis – inflammation of the lungs; and peritonitis – inflammation of the abdomen lining. Such complications can be treated with anti-inflammatory medication.",

    "faqs": "Q: What is the juvenile idiopathic arthritis prognosis? A: There is not one JIA, but several subtypes. Prognosis therefore depends on the particular subtype. Many children with this condition respond well to treatment and find that their symptoms improve over time. Many cases of JIA will resolve and leave a person without symptoms in adult life, though it is not possible to accurately predict this. In about 30 percent of cases, JIA may remain active into adult life. Some people may have joint damage, which can limit physical activities, and a few may require joint replacements, possibly later in adult life. Growth may be delayed, but can often resume with treatment, though some children may be physically smaller than average. Q: Does juvenile idiopathic arthritis require surgery? A: In most cases, surgery is not required, especially with recent advancements in medication. However, there are a few instances where surgery may be recommended. These include cases resulting in spinal deformity, spinal instability, nerve problems or severe damage to a joint. Surgical options include hip and knee replacements. This may be delayed until bones have finished growing to avoid certain complications. 10 Q: What is the difference between juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis? Are they just different ways of saying the same thing? A: Not exactly, though there is a lot of overlap. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) used to be the name used in the U.S. for a group of childhood arthritic conditions. In the late 1990s, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, along with the European term juvenile chronic arthritis, was replaced with the term juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This incorporates all of what was called JRA in the past and also includes all other forms of idiopathic arthritis in childhood. Anyone who was diagnosed with JRA would normally today be diagnosed with JIA, but not all those diagnosed with JIA would have been diagnosed with JRA. 11 Q: Is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) the same as rheumatoid arthritis in adults? If JIA persists into adulthood, will it become rheumatoid arthritis? A: No, JIA and rheumatoid arthritis are separate conditions which require different treatment and have different outcomes. A person who has JIA that persists into adulthood is considered to be an adult with a history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While the two diseases may have some similarities, they also have some key differences. Like rheumatoid arthritis, JIA is brought on by chronic inflammation that may cause disability if left untreated. However, JIA is not a single disease, but in fact several related conditions. A small number of children with JIA, actually have a condition indistinguishable from adult rheumatoid arthritis. Typically, this presents in post-pubescent girls, who are found to have high levels of rheumatoid factor antibodies with five or more joints affected, usually in a symmetrical arrangement. 12 Q: What is juvenile arthritis? Is it the same as juvenile idiopathic arthritis? A: Also known as pediatric rheumatic disease, juvenile arthritis (JA) refers to all autoimmune childhood conditions of the joints, muscles and fibrous tissues. JA includes JIA, as well as other conditions, such as juvenile lupus (see systemic lupus erythematosus ) and fibromyalgia . 13"

    "what_is_juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis": "Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) – also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) – is an inflammation of one or more joints, with an onset of symptoms occurring in a child or adolescent aged 16 years or younger. To be classified as JRA, the condition must persist for a minimum of six weeks and all other possible causes must be excluded. 1 Although the exact causes of JRA remain unclear, it is known that the condition is an autoimmune disorder. This means that disordered functioning of the body’s immune system plays a role in the development of JRA. In the majority of cases, the condition can be managed through prolonged treatment. This will typically involve a combination of medication and physical therapy. 2\n\nThere are various types of JRA, each with varying symptoms and levels of severity. 3 Oligoarthritis: The most common type of JRA, affecting roughly one third of those with the condition. For diagnosis, no more than four joints in a person’s body will be affected within the first six months of developing this condition. Oligoarthritis typically affects one or both knees, and can also cause chronic eye inflammation in some cases. Polyarthritis: The second most common form of JRA, which can develop suddenly or steadily over a period of weeks. For diagnosis, five or more joints must be affected during the first six months of the condition developing. It may cause painful inflammation of the wrists, ankles, toes, hips, knees, neck and jaw. Enthesitis-related JRA: This condition typically causes inflammation of the leg joints and spine, at sites where tendons or ligaments insert into joints, such as the heel. In some cases, this will be accompanied by acute uveitis (a painful eye condition). Enthesitis-related JRA is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For more information about conditions related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), see these resources on its two main forms, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis . Psoriatic arthritis: A combination of a skin rash, caused by a long-lasting autoimmune disease of the skin called psoriasis , with joint pain, usually in the fingers and toes. Systemic JIA: Also known as Still’s disease, this condition consists of joint pain combined with fever, tiredness, loss of weight, lack of appetite and a rash. It may lead to enlarged glands in the groin, arms and neck, as well as an enlarged spleen and liver.",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_symptoms": "Some of the most common JRA signs and symptoms include: 4 Tenderness and/or swelling of the joints Joints that are warm to the touch Rash Fever Limping General pain Stiffness (especially following sleep or inactivity) Fatigue Sleep problems Swollen lymph nodes Weight loss and a reduced appetite Symptoms typically vary from person to person although some are specific to certain subtypes of JRA. It is also possible for symptoms to alter over time, even over the course of a single day. If symptoms arise it is important to seek medical attention. By examining the symptoms a child is experiencing and ruling out other possible causes, a doctor will generally be able to identify whether JRA is present. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_complications": "With prompt and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for JRA can be greatly improved. However, without treatment or if the condition is particularly severe, complications can arise. Complications associated with JRA can include: 5 Anemia (a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin ) Permanent joint damage Disproportionate limbs Stunted growth (caused by the condition as well as some medications used to treat it) Eye inflammation (typically painful and can in very severe cases lead to blindness) Although complications are possible, the risk of them occurring can be reduced through careful management of the condition.",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_causes": "The causes of JRA are not fully understood. However, the condition is generally thought to be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system combined with genetic and/or environmental factors. Research suggests that JRA may be triggered by abnormal immune responses to certain viruses or other agents, causing joint inflammation when it is not needed. Although it is uncommon for two members of the same family to experience JRA, genetic mechanisms are thought to play a role in determining who develops the condition. Some research suggests human leukocyte antigens – a type of molecule which plays an important role in deciding how the body reacts to foreign agents – are particularly relevant to this process, with people who have an increased amount of a specific type of the molecule being at greater risk of developing JRA. 6 7",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_diagnosis": "To be classified as JRA, the signs and symptoms of the condition must occur before the age of 16. These signs and symptoms are not always obvious or detectable, and as a child may not understand what is and isn’t normal, they may not complain about certain symptoms, such as joint pain. However, by being aware of the symptoms of the condition and through careful monitoring of a child’s development, it should be possible for caregivers to identify the warning signs and ensure the required medical attention is sought. There is no single test that can be used to diagnose JRA. Instead, the condition is diagnosed by ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms. This is done by using a combination of methods, including looking at an individual’s family history, carrying out a physical examination, blood tests and imaging scans. 8\n\nAlthough it is rare for two or more members of the same family to be diagnosed with JRA, it is still important for doctors to look at one’s family medical history for any signs of predisposition to the condition. Doctors will pay particular attention to whether any family members have experienced an autoimmune disorder of any kind, as this may increase the chances of JRA.\n\nThe purpose of a physical examination is to look for the various early signs and symptoms of JRA that may be being experienced. Doctors will look for signs and symptoms including: A limp Not using or a reluctance to use a certain limb Stiffness (especially in the morning or after inactivity) A fever which comes and goes Joint swelling (lasting for six weeks or more) Fatigue and inactivity Loss of motor skill function\n\nA combination of different blood tests can be used to help diagnose JRA. These include: Rheumatoid factor: Generally the first test to be carried out. It tests for the rheumatoid factor antibody (an immune system molecule in the blood) which, although undetectable in more than 50% of cases, can indicate the presence of JRA. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) A test to measure levels of inflammation in the body. C-Reactive protein: Another test that can measure levels of inflammation. Antinuclear antibody: A test for antinuclear antibodies, which are often found in those with autoimmune disorders, including JRA. Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP): Although CCP is not routinely tested for in children, in some cases doctors may carry out tests for the presence of CCP antibodies which can then sometimes indicate JRA. The results of these tests can help doctors in making a diagnosis.\n\nVisits  to an ophthalmologist (a doctor specializing in eye care) are necessary to check for eye inflammation, both in the process of diagnosing JRA and to monitor disease progression. Left untreated, prolonged eye inflammation may lead to vision loss.\n\nImaging scans – such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) – can be used to help doctors identify any fractures, bone erosion, infections and any other damage which may help in their diagnosis.",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_treatment": "The aim of JRA treatment is to minimize pain, retain one’s range of motion and muscle function, facilitate normal growth and development, as well as to prevent serious complications. To achieve this, a long-term treatment plan involving a combination of drugs and physical therapy will typically be necessary. 9 In very rare cases, surgery may also be called for to help repair joint or bone damage caused by the condition.\n\nA range of medications are available to help treat JRA. Due to the severity of the side-effects that may be caused by many of these medications, doctors will usually be cautious about prescribing large doses, especially in the early stages of the condition. As the condition progresses and if symptoms become more severe, larger doses may be called for. Some of the most commonly prescribed medications for treating JRA include: 10 11 12 13 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): In most cases, NSAIDs will be used in the initial stages of treatment to help relieve pain and ease inflammation. This type of medication also has few side-effects. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter (ibuprofen, for example), while others need to  be prescribed by a doctor. Although NSAIDs can help to relieve certain symptoms, they do not affect the overall prognosis of JRA. Corticosteroids: Used to treat inflammation, pain and stiffness. These can be taken orally or injected directly into the affected area, which is particularly effective as a form of pain relief. They may lead to serious side effects (including weakened bones) if taken over a long period. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): This type of medication works by altering the way the immune system works. They are generally prefered by doctors treating JRA because of  their lack of side effects and  general efficacy. Methotrexate is the most commonly administered type of DMARD. Biological response modifiers: Generally reserved for the treatment of those who have not responded to DMARDs, this type of medication works by targeting the immune system and modifying the molecules causing the inflammation. They are usually administered through injection or infusion. Commonly prescribed drugs in this category are Etanercept or Adalimumab.\n\nAlthough movement may become painful for people with JRA, it is important to try and maintain an active, healthy lifestyle. This has the effect of keeping muscles and joints strong and flexible, and may reduce inflammation. A physical therapist will typically be recommended to help those with the condition to design an appropriate exercise plan which suits their individual needs.\n\nAlthough there are no specialist guidelines regarding diet for those with JRA, it is generally recommended that individuals eat a healthy and balanced diet. It may also be helpful to consume the following types of food, each known to contain anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties: 14 Oily fish high in Omega-3 (such as salmon, tuna and mackerel) Fruits and vegetables (especially strawberries, blueberries and cherries) Citrus fruits (high in vitamin C) Nuts Beans\n\nSurgery is rare in the treatment of JRA, as medications and physical therapy are generally sufficient. However, in a small number of cases – for example, if the condition is affecting the curvature of the spine – surgery may be performed. The need for surgery will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by doctors. 15",
    "other_names_for_juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis",
    "juvenile_rheumatoid_arthritis_faqs": "Q: What happens to people with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis after the age of 16? A: It may seem logical to think of JRA as simply a form of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experienced by people under the age of 16. In reality, JRA is a distinct condition with its own characteristics. For this reason, it not usual for JRA to simply become or graduate to rheumatoid arthritis in people over the age of 16. Instead, it is better to describe people in this situation as adults with a history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In rare cases, however, children diagnosed with JRA may actually have RA. If this is identified, it will then be accurate to describe the condition as RA. In other rare cases, the symptoms of JRA may fade as a child enters adulthood. This is typically the case in those who are diagnosed with JRA at a very young age and experience a mild form of the condition. 16 Q: What is the life expectancy for people with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis? A: It is difficult to give an accurate prognosis in cases of JRA. The condition is typically experienced throughout one’s life, but with proper treatment and management its symptoms can be effectively controlled. However, average life expectancies for people with JRA are generally shorter than those for people without the condition. The main reason for this is not the condition itself but the complications which can arise from the condition. 17"

    "what_is_keratoconjunctivitis_sicca_dry_eye_syndrome": "Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, also known as dry eye syndrome, is a common dysfunction of the eyes. It occurs when the eyes cannot produce tears or produce insufficient quantities of tears, or when there is an imbalance in the amount of oil, water and mucus in the tear fluid. The condition is a common cause of ocular irritation, typically resulting in a feeling of grittiness in the eyes, redness and blurred vision, among other symptoms. 1 While there are numerous potential underlying causes of dry eye syndrome, some of the most common include long periods spent in front of TV or computer screens, aging and certain medical conditions, including Sjögren syndrome, allergic conjunctivitis and rheumatoid arthritis . 2 Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can generally be effectively managed, with the choice of treatment method dependent on the underlying cause, the symptoms and the severity of the condition. Mild cases may respond well to simple environmental changes or over-the-counter eye drops, while more severe cases may require treatment methods such as anti-inflammatory medication or surgery. 1",
    "keratoconjunctivitis_sicca_symptoms": "The symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca are mild in most instances, but can nevertheless be highly troublesome for the affected person. Symptoms typically affect both eyes and may include: 2 3 Irritation and redness Dryness and grittiness A discharge of mucus Temporarily blurred vision Itching Sensitivity to light The sensation of a foreign-body in the eye Excessive tear production Symptoms tend to be at their worst at the end of the day or after protracted use of the eyes; after driving, for example. 3 People experiencing possible symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nIf any of the symptoms of dry eye syndrome persist or cause serious pain, medical attention should be sought.",
    "causes": "Tears are composed of a mixture of oil, water and mucus, a combination that ensures the surface of the eyes remains smooth and clear, as well as protecting the eyes from infection. 4 Dry eye syndrome generally occurs for one of three reasons: The glands of the eyes are unable to create an adequate amount of tears The tears evaporate too rapidly There is an imbalance in the composition of the tears\n\nOne common cause of dry eye syndrome is an inability of the glands in the eyes to produce enough tears to keep them moist. Typical reasons for this include: 1 Underlying medical conditions, including Sjögren syndrome, diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus , thyroid disorders and vitamin A deficiency Aging Certain medications including decongestants, antihistamines, hormone replacement therapy and antidepressants; medications used to treat high blood pressure , acne and Parkinson’s disease , as well as birth control drugs Laser eye surgery Damage to the tear glands from inflammation or radiation\n\nAnother common cause of dry eye syndrome is the evaporation of tears at an increased rate. Causes of this can include: Dry, windy, smoky or air-conditioned environments Blinking less often, typically when reading, driving, watching TV or using a computer Problems with the eyelids, such as ectropion, an out-turning of the eyelids, or entropion, an in-turning of the eyelids\n\nThe tear film that coats the eyes is composed of three substances, each with a different role within the eye: 4 Lipid: The oily outer layer produced by the meibomian glands. Prevents tears from evaporating too quickly. Aqueous: The watery middle layer produced by the tear glands. Helps to nourish the cornea and the conjunctiva. Mucus: The inner layer produced by goblet cells. Aids in binding water to the eyes, helping them to stay moist. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca can result from problems with any one of these layers. For example, the meibomian glands can become blocked, resulting in decreased production of oils or the production of lower-quality oils. 5",
    "diagnosing_keratoconjunctivitis_sicca": "People experiencing any of the symptoms of keratoconjunctivitis sicca should visit a doctor or ophthalmologist, an eye specialist, as soon as possible. In addition, a symptom assessment using the free Ada app can be carried out. Doctors may run a number of tests to identify the cause of the condition. These may include: 6 Fluorescein eye test: Fluorescent eye drops are used to highlight the tears in the eyes, enabling a specialist to monitor how tears are being produced and how quickly they are evaporating. The drops may also show any damage to the surface of the eye. Schirmer’s test: Blotting paper is placed over the lower eyelids and left for five minutes. The wetness of the paper determines the diagnosis, with less than 10 mm indicating the presence of dry eye syndrome. Lissamine green test: A strip of paper containing a special dye is placed over the surface of the eyes, allowing specialists to identify any damage to the surface of the eye.",
    "keratoconjunctivitis_sicca_treatment": "After being diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, a specialist will recommend a treatment route appropriate to the underlying cause, the specific symptoms and the severity of the condition. There is no cure for dry eye syndrome, but it can be effectively managed. Treatment may involve:\n\nFor people who experience keratoconjunctivitis sicca as a reaction to a certain medication, treatment may involve their doctor prescribing an alternative medication that is not associated with dry eyes. Even if there is a suspicion that a certain type of medication is causing keratoconjunctivitis sicca, never stop taking medication without first consulting a doctor.\n\nMild cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca may respond well to simple environmental and lifestyle changes. These may include: 1 4 Taking regular breaks from time spent in front of TV, computer or phone screens. Taking steps to reduce dryness in the environment. This may involve using a humidifier, reducing the heating or hanging up a damp cloth. Wearing glasses or goggles when exposed to dry, dusty or windy environments. In some cases, warm eye compresses and scrubs may be useful. In some cases, stopping smoking or reducing exposure to secondhand smoke may be useful.\n\nLubricant treatments, sometimes called artificial tears, include eye drops, ointments and gels. They are often effective in mild to moderate cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and most are available from pharmacists without a prescription. 8 At first, lubricant treatments may need to be used frequently – every hour, for example. Once symptoms begin to improve, they may be necessary less often. 1 Artificial tears containing preservatives should be avoided.\n\nIn severe or persistent cases, certain kinds of anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed by a doctor. Generally, these medications will only be recommended if the condition does not respond to lubricants. Anti-inflammatory medications include: 8 Corticosteroid eye drops and ointments Oral tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, lymecycline and oxytetracycline Ciclosporin eye drops\n\nIn severe cases and depending on the case, surgery may be recommended as a treatment method for keratoconjunctivitis sicca. A punctal occlusion is the most common type of surgery used for this purpose. The procedure involves inserting small plugs into the tear ducts, blocking the drainage route of tears and keeping the surface of the eyes moist as a result. Temporary plugs may be inserted at first to test the efficacy of the procedure. Later, more permanent plugs may be inserted. More rarely, a procedure known as a salivary gland autotransplantation may be carried out. This procedure involves transplanting glands responsible for the production of saliva from the lower lip to the area around the eyes. The saliva is then used as a substitute for tears. 8\n\nIn very rare cases, when all alternative treatment methods have proven ineffective, serum eye drops may be recommended. Serum eye drops are created by removing the blood cells from the blood of the affected person or that of a donor, leaving just the serum, which is then combined with a diluent and contained in a dropper bottle. 8 Due to the complexity of the process, serum eye drops can take several months to produce.",
    "keratoconjunctivitis_sicca_faqs": "Q: Are there any home remedies for keratoconjunctivitis sicca? A: Yes, there are a number of home remedies for dry eye syndrome, including: Warm compresses: In some cases, irritation can be reduced and the meibomian glands unclogged through the application of a warm compress. To do this, wet a clean cloth with warm water, place it over the eyes and gently dab the corners of the eyes. This may be necessary every day. Hygiene: Keeping the eyelids and areas surrounding the eyes clean, including the lashes,can help prevent dry eyes. A small amount of mild cleanser or shampoo can be used to clean this area. Avoiding excessive touching of the eyes can also help keep the eyes clean. Hydration: A person can stay hydrated by drinking sufficient amounts of water, roughly 8 to 10 glasses daily. This can help the eyes to stay moist. Environmental and lifestyle changes: Measures such as avoiding overly-dry environments and taking regular breaks from activities, such as watching TV and using the computer can be effective in managing dry eyes. Q: Should I be worried about blurred vision as a result of keratoconjunctivitis sicca? A: Temporarily blurred vision can be a symptom of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Although an inconvenience, it can usually be managed through treatment. However, those who experience blurred vision should seek medical attention, as, in rare cases, it can be a symptom of a more serious condition. Q: What can I do when my eyes feel dry? A: If your eyes begin to feel dry during activities such as driving, reading or using a computer, it is a good idea to take frequent breaks to allow the tear film to refresh. You should also remember to blink frequently. Laying a clean damp cloth over your eyes may also be effective in re-moisturising the eyes. Hanging up a damp cloth may also be effective in reducing the dryness in the environment. Q: Is there a surgical method of treatment for keratoconjunctivitis sicca? A: Yes, a minor, non-invasive surgical procedure to insert punctal plugs can be used to treat dry eye syndrome. These tiny plugs are placed into the opening of the tear ducts in the eyes. They work by blocking the drainage of tears from the eyes, keeping them lubricated. Surgery will generally only be recommended in some patients after other treatment methods have proven unsuccessful. Q: What is the relationship between keratoconjunctivitis sicca and meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)? A: Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is among the leading causes of keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The condition occurs when the glands responsible for the oily component in tears cease to function, preventing the oily component from being released and causing the watery component to dry out more quickly. 10 Q: What is the relationship between dry eye syndrome and Sjögren syndrome? A: Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. Its principal symptom is dryness of the eyes and mouth. As such, Sjögren syndrome is one of the leading causes of dry eye syndrome."

    "what_is_late_lyme_disease": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi . This bacteria is disseminated through tick bites. Infected ticks usually bite small mammals, who do not develop any kind of infection from the bacteria. When humans are exposed to B. Burgdorferi from a tick bite, however, they can develop Lyme disease. 1 People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas, where there is greater potential for exposure to tick bites, are most at risk of infection.\n\nLyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is caused by an infection with the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi . This bacteria is disseminated through tick bites. Infected ticks usually bite small mammals, who do not develop any kind of infection from the bacteria. When humans are exposed to B. Burgdorferi from a tick bite, however, they can develop Lyme disease. 1 People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas, where there is greater potential for exposure to tick bites, are most at risk of infection. Lyme disease is a condition which progresses in stages: A person will initially develop early localized Lyme disease , in which the bacteria have not yet spread through the body. At this stage, which generally has its onset days or weeks after the tick bite, a person’s symptoms will usually include a fever, fatigue, and a rash, called the Erythema Migrans rash, 2 which has a distinctive bulls’ eye shape and affects around two-thirds of people who develop Lyme disease. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early localized Lyme disease. If early localized Lyme disease is not successfully treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline, in time, it will develop into early disseminated Lyme disease, spreading to other areas of the body. If this occurs, other oral or intravenous antibiotics will be needed; oral antibiotics will be used in cases which are considered less severe. See this resource for more information on symptoms and treatment of early disseminated Lyme disease. If Lyme disease is not diagnosed in either of these early stages and is not treated effectively with antibiotics, 3 the bacteria that cause LD can spread throughout the body from the site of the tick bite, resulting in late disseminated Lyme disease or late Lyme disease. The onset of symptoms and complications of late disseminated Lyme disease is usually around 6-36 months after the original infection.\n\nSymptoms of late Lyme disease may include joint pain (arthritis), skin changes, and musculoskeletal or neurologic complications. Like the less severe forms of Lyme disease, late Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics, although medical opinions differ about the appropriate length of an antibiotic treatment course. 3 Regardless, most people recover well, although some symptoms associated with late Lyme disease, such as fatigue, may persist for some time following treatment.",
    "what_are_the_risks": "Lyme disease is caused by bacteria called Borrelia Burgdorferi . These bacteria are spread through tick bites from infected black-legged ticks. A person’s risk of contracting Lyme disease, and, by extension, late Lyme disease, is increased by spending time outdoors in wooded areas where there is a greater risk of exposure to these bacteria from ticks, and/or by living with domestic animals such as cats and dogs who may bring ticks infected with B. Burgdorferi into the home. No type of Lyme disease can be passed from person to person, so there is no risk of infection between humans . Although anyone can develop Lyme disease, it tends to be slightly more common in children and older adults . It is possible to minimise the risk of infection from Lyme disease in all people by checking the body for ticks, particularly after spending time in woodland areas or heaths. To remove a tick: 4 Use a pair of fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick where it meets the skin’s surface. Pull the tick upwards steadily, without twisting or jerking it. Try to remove the whole tick at once, including the mouth parts. If the mouth parts of the tick break off when the body of the tick is removed, remove them separately. Clean the skin thoroughly with soap and water or rubbing alcohol after the tick is entirely removed. Dispose of the tick without crushing it between the fingers, as this can result in contracting Lyme disease. Treating Lyme disease promptly with antibiotics , as soon after showing symptoms following a bite from an infected tick as possible, can help to reduce the likelihood of developing late disseminated Lyme disease.",
    "late_stage_lyme_disease_symptoms": "Late Lyme disease usually develops 6-36 months after a person first receives the causal infectious tick bite. The symptoms of late Lyme disease differ from the earlier stages. In North America, joint pain and swelling is very common. In Europe, skin changes are more common. These skin changes consist of swelling, redness and thinning of the skin on usually one hand or one foot. Other symptoms of LLD may include arthritis, weakness of the facial muscles, heart palpitations and aching muscles. Although some people may develop neurologic problems , these are rare, but may include: Lack of stamina and fatigue Tingling and numbness in the hands and feet Confusion Memory problems Difficulty concentrating Headaches When a person develops neurologic complications from late Lyme disease, these may result in a diagnosis of chronic neurologic Lyme disease or neuropsychiatric Lyme disease , depending on the nature of the complications that they experience: Symptoms of chronic neurologic Lyme disease may include: chronic encephalopathy (cognitive inefficiency), polyneuropathy, or leukoencephalitis. Symptoms of neuropsychiatric Lyme disease may include: myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord), meningitis (inflammation of the brain’s enveloping membrane), cranial neuritis (inflammation of the cranial nerves), painful radiculitis (inflammation of the nerve roots), encephalopathy, encephalitis (inflammation within the brain) and/or encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord). Both chronic neurologic Lyme disease and neuropsychiatric Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. The type, dosage and course of antibiotics used will depend on the specific needs of the person affected, and the symptoms they are experiencing.\n\nIn post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), certain symptoms of Lyme disease return, weeks, months or even years after early (localized or disseminated) or late Lyme disease has been treated. PTLDS is sometimes also called chronic Lyme disease, although, somewhat confusingly, the term chronic lyme disease can also be interchangeably applied to persistent cases of late Lyme disease. The key difference between PTLDS and late Lyme disease is that, in cases of PTLDS, there is no detectable active infection within the body , despite the presence of symptoms. Many symptoms of PTLDS are similar to those of late Lyme disease, and include: 5 Fatigue Numbness and joint pain (arthritis) Neurologic difficulties such as impaired memory and concentration Depression Widespread musculoskeletal pain People with PTLDS often report that their symptoms lessen and intensify over time. 5 A tailored treatment approach is needed to address the specific symptoms of PTLDS that a person experiences, on a case-by-case basis.",
    "late_lyme_disease_diagnosis": "The diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease can be very difficult, and is usually made by a specialist in infectious diseases. The diagnosis can be confirmed if the affected person has had the characteristic 'bull's eye' rash and has lived or worked in areas where ticks are present, or with a blood test.",
    "late_stage_lyme_disease_treatment": "Treatment for late Lyme disease is different from treatment for early Lyme disease. When the condition is in its early stages, e.g. when the Erythema Migrans rash is present, a short course of antibiotics may be sufficient to stop the bacterial infection spreading to other parts of the body. Late Lyme disease often requires antibiotic treatment over a period of up to 28 days. Sometimes these antibiotics must be administered intravenously (through a drip).",
    "how_to_prevent_late_lyme_disease": "Avoiding tick bites by using insect repellents and protective clothing is important to prevent this condition, especially in areas which are known to have Lyme disease. There is no vaccination available.",

    "condition": "Legionella Infection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/legionella-infection/",
    "what_is_legionella_infection": "Legionella infection, also known as legionellosis, is a bacterial infection most often affecting the airways and/or lungs. It is frequently caused by a bacterium called Legionella pneumophila, which thrives in warm, wet environments such as hot tubs and air conditioning units. The infection can be caught by inhaling contaminated water droplets. Transference of the disease between humans generally does not occur, with only one case of possible person-to-person transmission ever reported. Legionella infection can affect the lungs, causing a potentially severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires’ disease. Legionnaires’ disease causes respiratory symptoms, such as coughing, often alongside a combination of other symptoms including: Fever Chills Nausea Diarrhea Headache There is also a similar but milder form of the infection called Pontiac fever, which presents as a mild, flu-like illness. Pontiac fever does not cause pneumonia and usually resolves on its own without treatment. People of any age can catch Legionella infection, although elderly people and those with a weakened immune system are most commonly affected. Legionella infection is uncommon in children. Diagnosis is usually made through laboratory tests that check for the presence of Legionella bacteria in the affected person’s urine, blood and/or phlegm. A chest X-ray is typically also recommended when Legionnaires’ disease is suspected to check for pneumonia in the lungs. Antibiotics are most often prescribed to treat Legionnaires’ disease. Complications are possible, particularly within high-risk groups, such as elderly people and those with certain underlying health conditions, such as chronic lung or kidney disease . In severe cases, Legionnaires’ disease can be fatal. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, most people make a full recovery.",
    "types": "Legionella infection, or legionellosis, refers to two different, but related, conditions: Legionnaires’ disease Pontiac fever Both of these conditions are caused by the Legionella bacteria. However, Legionnaires’ disease is the more serious of the two. Legionnaires’ disease is characterized by the presence of pneumonia , whereas Pontiac fever is non-pneumonic. If you are experiencing possible symptoms of Legionella infection, you can carry out a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .",
    "symptoms": "The precise symptoms experienced as a result of Legionella infection depend on whether the affected person has Legionnaires’ disease or Pontiac fever.\n\nLegionnaires’ disease is a more severe illness, and symptoms tend to appear between 2 to 10 days after becoming infected. Respiratory symptoms are usually a key feature of Legionnaires’ disease. Respiratory symptoms may include: A cough which is dry at first, but begins to produce mucus and phlegm as the condition progresses. This is the most common respiratory symptom of Legionnaires’ disease Shortness of breath Chest pain Bloody phlegm Respiratory symptoms may not be present at first, but develop as the infection progresses. Flu-like symptoms are also a common sign of Legionnaires’ disease and can include: Fever Chills Muscle aches Headache Fatigue Weakness Generally feeling unwell In addition to the above, further symptoms that have also been associated with Legionnaires’ disease, include: Diarrhea Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Joint pain Neurological symptoms such as confusion, agitation or a dazed, unresponsive state known as stupor Good to know: Although Legionnaires’ disease symptoms usually appear around 2 to 10 days after infection by the bacteria, an incubation period of up to 16 days has been recorded in some instances. It is therefore recommended that anyone who may have been exposed to Legionella bacteria monitors themselves for symptoms for around two weeks after exposure. If Legionnaires’ disease is suspected, always contact a doctor.\n\nPontiac fever also causes flu-like symptoms, most commonly fever and muscle aches. However, it is a milder infection than Legionnaires’ disease, and the symptoms experienced are usually less intense. Most significantly, Pontiac fever does not result in pneumonia. This means that respiratory symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath are not usually present in people with this condition. Symptoms of Pontiac fever generally arise around one to three days after first becoming infected. Pontiac fever is a self-limiting condition, which means, the illness usually passes of its own accord without the need for medication. Symptoms generally resolve within a week.\n\nLegionella infection most often affects the lungs and airways. However, in very rare cases, the infection can occur outside the respiratory tract. This is known as extrapulmonary Legionella infection and can cause conditions such as: Sinusitis , a swelling of the sinuses in the nose Cellulitis, a skin infection Pancreatitis , a swelling of the pancreas Myocarditis , an inflammation of the heart muscle Pericarditis, an inflammation of the membrane around the heart Infective endocarditis , an inflammation of the heart’s inner lining and valves Pyelonephritis , an inflammation of the kidney Peritonitis, an inflammation of the abdomen’s inner lining Meningitis , an infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord Osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone Septic arthritis Soft tissue and brain abscesses Surgical site infection Good to know: Extrapulmonary Legionella infection is rare. However, when it does occur, it can manifest either as a complication of pneumonia or independently of pneumonia. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have contracted Legionella infection, always contact a doctor. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "legionella_vs_covid_19_symptoms": "Both an infection with Legionella and COVID-19 can present similar symptoms in the initial stage. These symptoms may include fever, a dry cough, headache, confusion, shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea. Both conditions can also cause pneumonia. As the symptoms are so alike, the only way of differentiating between the two is by laboratory testing. Since the cause for both conditions is different, the treatment options are also different, going from antiviral medication for COVID-19 to antibiotics for Legionnaires' disease.",
    "causes": "The most common cause of Legionella infection in humans is a bacterium called Legionella pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila is the cause of approximately 70 to 90 percent of Legionella infections in adults. Other Legionella species, such as Legionella longbeachae and Legionella micdadei, can also cause the disease, but are much less common. Transmission of Legionella infection usually occurs when a person breathes in airborne water droplets that are contaminated with Legionella bacteria. The bacteria subsequently enter the person’s respiratory tract, causing Legionnaires’ disease, or, less commonly, Pontiac fever. However, the likelihood of developing an illness can depend on a number of factors, including: The concentration of Legionella bacteria in the water source The severity of the particular strain of Legionella bacteria The quantity of aerosolized water droplets in the air The presence of any risk factors in the affected person, such as advanced age or pre-existing health conditions Good to know: It is not known precisely what concentration of Legionella bacteria is necessary to cause illness. However, it is believed that high-risk people may develop Legionella infection after relatively limited amounts of exposure. Legionella pneumophila is often found in bodies of freshwater, such as rivers, lakes and streams. However, as the bacterium thrives in warm, wet environments, it can spread to artificial water systems used by humans. Systems where Legionella pneumophila may be found, include: ref1 ref11 Air conditioning units that use water-based cooling towers Hot tubs and whirlpool spas Water birth tubs Showers and sink faucets Large plumbing systems Hot water tanks Water fountains Humidifiers Respiratory therapy equipment, such as nebulizer machines Rainwater puddles on roads Soil and compost Hospitals, large hotels, museums and office blocks often have large and complex water supply systems where Legionella pneumophila can spread quickly. Because the bacterium commonly dwells in specific locations, it is prone to causing outbreaks. The majority of Legionella infection outbreaks, that have occurred in hospitals, have been linked to a contaminated hot water supply. Good to know: Home and car air conditioning units usually do not use water to cool the air, meaning they are not typical sites for Legionella bacteria. Generally, it is large or industrial-level air conditioning units that use cooling towers containing water and therefore are at higher risk for Legionella growth.",
    "risk_factors_for_legionella_infection": "In the United States, it is estimated that around 8,000 to 18,000 people are admitted to hospital with Legionnaires’ disease every year. Of these, more than 80 percent of cases are spread throughout the year, and the remaining 20 percent are the result of outbreaks during summer and early fall. In adults, established risk factors for Legionella infection include: Advanced age. Middle-aged and older adults are at higher risk of developing Legionnaires’ disease. It is rare in young adults and children Gender. Men are more than twice as likely to develop Legionnaires’ disease than women Smoking. Tobacco smoke exposure increases a person’s vulnerability to bacterial infections Alcohol abuse Chronic diseases, such as chronic lung or heart disease Weakened immune system, also known as immunodeficiency, which can be due to illness, e.g. HIV infection or drugs that weaken the immune system, e.g. chemotherapy Certain underlying health conditions, such as diabetes mellitus , cancers, kidney failure or liver failure Legionella infection is much less common in children, and the risk factors for children are less well defined than they are for adults. However, some risk factors believed to affect children include: Young age. More than a third of reported Legionnaires’ disease cases in children have occurred in infants under the age of one year old Weakened immune system Respiratory diseases, such as chronic lung disease or asthma Water births Good to know: Risk factors not only increase the chances of a person developing Legionella infection, but some may also increase the severity of the condition. This means that certain high-risk people are also more likely to develop complications as a result of a Legionella infection. If Legionella infection is suspected, contact a doctor immediately.",
    "diagnosis": "Legionella infection can result in two distinct conditions, Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever. Although these conditions are caused by the same bacteria, Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever are generally not diagnosed in the same way.\n\nA diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is usually made based on a combination of a clinical evaluation, a chest X-ray and laboratory analysis of a phlegm, urine and/or blood sample from the affected person.\n\nIf Legionnaires’ disease is suspected, a doctor will often begin by asking about a person’s symptoms and personal history. Because Legionella bacteria often dwell in specific locations, the person may be asked whether they have been near high-risk areas, such as hot tubs or cooling towers. Although a clinical evaluation alone is typically not able to confirm a diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease, it may help to support a diagnosis. For example, although Legionnaires’ disease is hard to reliably distinguish from other types of pneumonia , it may raise the suspicion that they have Legionnaires’ disease if the affected person is also displaying gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. If Legionnaires’ disease is suspected after a clinical evaluation, the affected person will usually be moved onto a further stage of the diagnostic process.\n\nA chest X-ray is often recommended for a person with suspected Legionnaires’ disease. This is because Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia , and a chest X-ray can generally confirm the presence of pneumonia in the lungs, as well as the severity of the infection. However, it is not able to distinguish Legionella pneumonia from other types of pneumonia.\n\nA definitive diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease can typically be made following a positive laboratory test result, usually on a sample of phlegm, urine or blood. The main tests used to detect Legionella infection include: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a type of nucleic acid test (NAT). PCR testing on a lower respiratory tract sample, such as phlegm, is often considered the preferable diagnostic method for people with possible Legionnaires’ disease. PCR can detect all types of Legionella bacteria through a sample of a person’s phlegm, urine or blood; however, lower respiratory tract samples are believed to have the highest level of accuracy. Urinary antigen testing may be suggested if PCR testing is not available or a lower respiratory tract sample cannot be obtained. Urinary antigen testing is fast and sensitive, however, it can only detect Legionella pneumophila. If a negative result is received, but Legionella infection is still suspected, a culture test may be recommended instead. Culture testing can be done on nearly any sample type, however, the results typically take three to five days, and it can be less sensitive than other testing methods. If a PCR or urinary antigen test is positive for Legionella infection, a lower respiratory tract sample will often be taken for culture testing to research into the causes of the infection. As a single test may not be conclusive enough to confirm a diagnosis, a doctor may recommend a combination of laboratory tests to check if a person has Legionnaires’ disease. Good to know: Testing for Legionella infection is generally recommended for anyone with severe pneumonia that has been acquired outside of a healthcare setting, also known as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). People with nonsevere CAP may also be recommended for testing if they have specific risk factors or are believed to have been exposed to Legionella bacteria. People experiencing possible symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease should consult a doctor. You can also use the Ada app to carry out a free symptom assessment.\n\nPontiac fever, the less serious type of Legionella infection, typically cannot be detected through testing the person’s blood, urine or phlegm. Instead, Pontiac fever is most often diagnosed when the symptoms match the clinical criteria, and other cases of Legionella infection have been confirmed within the same area and timeframe. Good to know: Pontiac fever is usually not serious. It also typically resolves on its own without the need for treatment. Therefore, swift diagnosis and treatment is not as crucial for Pontiac fever as it is for Legionnaires’ disease.",
    "treatment": "Most cases of Legionnaires’ disease can be successfully treated with antibiotics that help to kill the Legionella bacteria in the body. A class of antibiotic drug called fluoroquinolones is often recommended to treat Legionnaires’ disease and can be administered either orally or intravenously. Another class of antibiotic, known as macrolides, may also be suggested. Due to the potential severity of Legionnaires’ disease, most patients who contract the illness are admitted to hospital to receive intensive antibiotic treatment. To begin with, antibiotics are usually given intravenously, meaning they are injected directly into the bloodstream. This is because intravenous drugs begin to act faster than those taken orally, and also because people with Legionnaires’ disease may have poor stomach absorption due to their gastrointestinal symptoms. Good to know: Antibiotic treatment for Legionnaires’ disease may last from a few days up to a number of weeks. The length of treatment can depend on factors such as the severity of the illness, the overall health of the affected person and the specific medication prescribed. With prompt and appropriate treatment, most people with Legionnaires’ disease make a full recovery and begin to see symptomatic improvements within three to five days. Other treatment methods that may be suggested alongside antibiotic treatment include: Medications that help ease pain and high temperatures, such as paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen Extra oxygen, because pneumonia can affect the lungs’ ability to breathe properly. Oxygen is usually administered through a face mask or nasal tube Extra fluids to help combat dehydration. Urgent fluids are usually administered through an intravenous drip Assisted breathing through a ventilator, if the infection is particularly severe\n\nPontiac fever does not usually require antibiotic treatment. The condition is generally mild in nature and tends to clear on its own within a week. However, people with Pontiac fever may wish to manage the flu-like symptoms it causes, such as fever and muscle aches. Measures that may help to ease such symptoms include: Drinking lots of water to stay hydrated Reducing fever and aches with paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Resting and avoiding strenuous activities",
    "preventing_legionella_infection": "The main cause of Legionella infection is contaminated water sources. Therefore, keeping water systems such as cooling towers, hot tubs and water fountains clean and well maintained can help to prevent some cases of infection. The precise measures taken to ensure water systems are well maintained depend on the system itself, e.g. what the water is used for, how much water is stored in it, what temperature the water is kept at. However, examples of control measures that may help to minimize the growth of Legionella bacteria in water systems include: Regular cleaning and disinfecting Flushing unused taps on a weekly basis to help reduce stagnation where necessary Maintaining chemical levels that help prevent the development of germs where necessary, e.g. chlorine levels in a hot tub Implementing a water filter system in high-risk areas, e.g. pediatric hospitals, birthing tubs or when an outbreak is suspected Keeping cool water at a temperature below 68 F / 20 C and hot water above 140 F / 60 C where necessary Good to know: The manufacturer’s instructions should always be followed for guidelines on proper water system maintenance, including home devices such as humidifiers and spas.\n\nMost cases of Legionella infection are caught sporadically, however, occasional outbreaks do occur. If an outbreak is suspected, early identification and decontamination of the source of infection can be hugely beneficial in managing the spread of the infection. There is no vaccine against Legionella infection. Good to know: Legionella infection generally does not spread from human to human. Therefore, people with this condition do not require isolation.",
    "complications": "While Pontiac fever is a relatively mild illness, Legionnaires’ disease can be very severe and often requires hospitalization. Although most cases of Legionnaires’ disease are successfully treated with antibiotics, complications can occur. In the most serious cases, Legionnaires’ disease can be a life-threatening condition. Certain groups are at higher risk of developing complications due to Legionnaires’ disease, including: The elderly and children under one year old People with certain underlying health conditions such as chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus , cancers or a weakened immune system People who received delayed antibiotic treatment People who acquired the infection in hospital As Legionnaires’ disease affects the lungs and causes pneumonia , severe complications of the condition can include: Lung failure, also known as respiratory failure Kidney failure , also known as renal failure Multiple organ failure, also known as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Shock, which occurs when not enough blood or oxygen is reaching a person’s organs and cells Sepsis , which occurs when the infection enters the bloodstream The overall prognosis for people with Legionnaires’ disease is variable. While some people experience rapid improvement upon treatment, others may take much longer to recover. One study found that, out of 190 people with Legionnaires’ disease, many were still experiencing one or more health problems one year after the onset of infection, such as fatigue and reduced general quality of life. The mortality rate for Legionnaires’ disease can go up to 50 percent in people who contracted the illness in a hospital setting. However, the outlook for Legionnaires’ disease depends on multiple factors including the overall health of the affected person, the promptness and course of treatment, as well as where the infection was acquired.",
    "other_names_for_legionella_infection": "Legionnaires’ disease Pontiac fever Legionella pneumonia Legionella pneumophila infection Legionellosis",
    "legionella_infection_faqs": "Q: What causes Legionella infection? A: Legionella infection is caused by bacteria called Legionella, of which there are numerous species. Although any species of Legionella bacteria can cause an infection, it is believed that up to 90 percent of adult cases of Legionnaires’ disease are caused by a specific species called Legionella pneumophila . Q: Do Legionella bacteria live in water? A: Legionella bacteria are most commonly found in water. Legionella pneumophila is often found in natural freshwater sources, such as rivers and lakes. Legionella becomes a health concern when it spreads to human-made water systems, such as air conditioning cooling towers, hot tubs and water fountains, where it may be breathed in and cause an infection. Q: What’s the difference between Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever? A: Both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever are caused by Legionella bacteria and are a type of Legionella infection. When the bacteria infect the lungs, a potentially severe form of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease is caused. This often results in respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath, as well as flu-like symptoms, such as fever and muscle aches. Legionnaires’ disease typically requires hospitalization and immediate antibiotic treatment. Pontiac fever is a less common and much milder form of Legionella infection. It does not cause pneumonia, and symptoms usually resemble those of a mild flu infection. Pontiac fever is generally self-limiting, meaning it goes away on its own without medical intervention. Q: Is Legionella infection contagious? A: Legionella infection is generally not transmitted between humans, likely due to the fact that a high dose of Legionella bacteria is required to cause infection. Only one case of possible person-to-person infection has been reported. Instead, Legionella infection is most often caught when a person inhales airborne water droplets containing the bacteria. Q: What is the origin and history of Legionnaires’ disease? A: Legionella bacteria were first discovered after an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease in 1976. The outbreak occurred at a convention of the American Legion, which is why the bacteria are now known as Legionella. This pneumonic form of the illness subsequently became known as Legionnaires’ disease. The milder, non-pneumonic form of the infection, called Pontiac fever, was first identified in Pontiac, Michigan during 1968. However, it wasn’t until Legionella bacteria were discovered in 1976, that health professionals were able to confirm the two conditions are both caused by the same bacteria."

    "condition": "Liver Cirrhosis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/liver-cirrhosis/",
    "what_is_liver_cirrhosis": "Liver cirrhosis occurs when a long-term medical condition causes the liver to form scar tissue. This scar tissue replaces the normal, healthy liver, and causes the liver to become less effective. This causes problems with blood flow through the liver and interferes with the liver's other functions. There are many possible causes of liver cirrhosis, but the most common causes are hepatitis, fatty liver disease, and long-term, heavy alcohol use. Diagnosis may involve multiple tests to investigate the remaining ability of the liver and the cause of the damage. Treatment involves managing the underlying cause and preventing further damage to the liver. It is important to reduce or stop drinking alcohol, and to keep to a low-protein diet. There is no cure for liver cirrhosis, but good management can slow down the scarring process and stop the condition from progressing. If you think you may be experiencing symptoms of liver cirrhosis, try the Ada app for a free health assessment.",
    "liver_cirrhosis_risks": "The liver has many functions, and acts to break down (metabolize) many substances that we eat and drink (alcohol and some medications, for example), produces substances for digestion (bile), stores sugar for future use, and produces proteins to help with other bodily functions, such as blood clotting. The most common causes of liver cirrhosis are long-term, heavy alcohol use and long-term viral hepatitis B or C. Other causes include inflammation caused by autoimmune diseases (where the immune system mistakenly attacks the liver or the bile ducts), or the excessive storage of iron (hemochromatosis) or fat (fatty liver disease) in the liver. Some medications can also cause this condition. This condition is common. Liver cirrhosis most commonly affects older adults, and people with other medical conditions. Obesity is also a risk factor.",
    "liver_cirrhosis_symptoms": "The typical symptoms include tiredness, itchy skin, tremor, a loss of appetite, weight and muscle loss, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), small spider-shaped blood vessels on the skin, and swelling of the legs and abdomen. As the condition progresses, people may become confused, forgetful and drowsy. The symptoms of liver cirrhosis occur when the liver is scarred and not able to let blood flow freely through or perform the functions that it should. For this reason, symptoms usually only occur in the later stages of cirrhosis.",
    "diagnosing_liver_cirrhosis": "The diagnosis is made by a doctor assessing symptoms, doing a physical examination and doing a blood test to investigate the liver function and possible underlying causes, such as the hepatitis virus, or signs of inflammation in the body. In many cases, an ultrasound or CT scan of the liver is also necessary. In some cases, a small sample of the liver (a biopsy) may be taken to investigate the underlying cause.",
    "treatment": "The treatment depends on the causes of liver cirrhosis and the stage of the liver damage at the time of diagnosis. Common measures include reducing alcohol intake, taking lactulose and eating a low protein diet. If there is an underlying cause, it should be treated or managed. Other procedures may be needed to investigate or treat the complications. The last resort in cases of total liver failure is liver transplantation.",
    "prevention": "Reducing alcohol intake can help to prevent many cases of liver cirrhosis. Preventing hepatitis B or C infections can also help to prevent this condition. Maintaining a healthy weight is also helpful.",

These worms are spread to humans by the bite of a deerfly, which is also known as a mango or mangrove fly. The infectious flies are most common in West and Central Africa. The risk of infection is higher in rainforest areas, especially during the rainy season. There may be a delay of weeks to years before symptoms appear. Many people with the infection will not experience any symptoms at first. When symptoms do occur, they most commonly involve itchy swellings under the skin. They usually change position or disappear within days or weeks. These swellings are a reaction to the Loa loa worm under the skin. The worms may also move to the eye, causing irritation. An outline of the worm may be visible below the surface of the eyeball. Diagnosis is based on the affected person's history and a physical exam. A blood test or removal of a worm from the skin or eye can confirm the diagnosis. The infection is treated with antiparasitic medication, and most people recover well. Those with a serious infection are at risk of complications affecting the brain, heart, or kidneys."

The World Health Organisation classifies LD as an infectious or parasitic disease. People who work outside or spend time in woodland areas are most likely to be affected. In the United States, about 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention every year.\n\nThere are three subtypes of Lyme disease. Early LD tends to cause symptoms in one location first, this is called localized Lyme disease , and then spreads slowly through the body. This is called disseminated Lyme disease . The third type of LD, late Lyme disease tends to be slightly more common in children and older adults.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of Lyme disease may differ, depending on whether a person has early LD or late LD. The trademark feature of Lyme disease is the erythema migrans rash, a distinctive skin irritation shaped like a bull’s eye. Its presence is proof of LD. This rash usually appears at the site of a tick bite, but can appear elsewhere on the body. Good to know: A tick bite itself is not an indication of Lyme disease.\n\nIn localized LD, the erythema migrans rash takes the form of an inflammation, surrounded by a circular border of non-irritated skin, followed by a final, circular border of irritated skin. It can increase to up to 30 centimetres in diameter and can be painful or itchy. The rash appears on average 11 to 18 days after the tick has detached or was removed. It is possible to have more than one bull’s eye rash on the body, but it is also possible to contract LD without developing the rash, which only appears in 60 to 80 percent of people who have been infected with LD. Besides the rash, the symptoms at the onset of Lyme disease may be similar to flu. Early symptoms of LD include: Aching muscles Cold flushes Fatigue Fever Painful joints. As the bacteria begin to spread, a person can develop disseminated LD. This usually occurs if the early symptoms of LD are not spotted or treated and the infection continues to be present in a person’s body for 1-4 months. 1 Symptoms of disseminated LD may include more rashes appearing on other parts of the skin to accompany the initial, circular rash at the site of the tick bite and painful, swollen joints. More rarely, affected people may experience neurological problems at this stage, such as difficulty concentrating. Feeling unwell?

Later symptoms can vary from person to person, but include further pain and swelling in the joints. Although some people may develop neurological problems, these are rare. They may include tingling or numbness in the hands and feet. 2 Weeks or months after infection has occurred, people may also experience complications with their central nervous system. Read more about Late Lyme Disease »",
    "causes": "Lyme disease is primarily transmitted through the infectious bites of immature blacklegged ticks called nymphs, which feed during the spring and summer months. Ticks wait in grass and plants and cling to the fur or clothing of animals or humans as they pass by. They then bite into the skin, where they anchor themselves firmly and begin feeding. Ticks must be attached for at least 36 to 48 hours before the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi can be transmitted. Although ticks can feed anywhere on the body, they prefer thin-skinned areas which are more easily punctured such as the groin, armpits and behind the ears. The bacterium that causes a person to develop Lyme disease is also carried by adult ticks, but they tend to be easier to spot than nymphs and are likely to be removed before infection occurs. Lyme disease is not thought to be spread by human-to-human contact. For example, people cannot get infected by close bodily contact with somebody who is suffering from Lyme disease. 3 Although animals can contract LD, there is no evidence that it can be passed on to a human from an infected animal, without the involvement of a tick. However, domestic pets, especially dogs, can bring humans into contact with LD by carrying infected ticks in their fur.",
    "diagnosis": "If an individual experiences symptoms which include the bull’s eye rash and their history includes a tick bite or possible exposure to ticks, these details are usually sufficient on their own to make a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease. Most people who fit this description begin treatment without waiting for the results of any blood tests taken. However, the flu -like symptoms of LD are also symptoms of many other conditions including flu itself, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and relapsing fever. For this reason, in cases where the erythema migrans rash is not present, blood tests will be necessary to rule out other conditions and to diagnose Lyme disease.\n\nBlood tests for Lyme disease work by identifying the levels of various antibodies in the blood. Where LD is present, the levels of antibodies in the blood rise in order to combat the infection. The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test is usually the initial test performed to screen for Lyme disease. However, it is not always accurate, and it is important to remember that a negative result does not necessarily rule out the presence of LD, as it can take antibodies 6-8 weeks after infection to appear in blood tests. 4 A positive ELISA test should be followed by a supplementary Western blot test. This test can detect two different classes of antibodies that the body produces as it reacts against the different molecules, or “antigens”, which are part of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria that cause LD. Good to know: The body produces IgM antibodies as a first response to LD, so a positive test can be used to make an early diagnosis. One problem with testing for IgM antibodies is that a false positive result is a likely possibility. It can take 4-6 weeks for the body to produce IgG antibodies in large enough quantities for the Western blot test to detect them, so it is not possible to make an early diagnosis of LD by testing for IgG antibodies. However, tests for IgG antibodies tend to be more accurate. Read more about Blood Test Results »",
    "treatment": "Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated with oral antibiotics. These most commonly include amoxicillin, cefuroxime or doxycycline. Early treatment of LD is most likely to be successful and the majority of people who are diagnosed promptly with LD, and treated early, recover well. However, a small number of people continue to present symptoms despite using antibiotics.\n\nAfter being prescribed antibiotics for Lyme disease, it is advisable to closely monitor one’s symptoms as they improve in order to ensure that the recovery process is underway. It is advisable to visit the doctor and to repeat blood tests for IgG antibodies to confirm that the Lyme disease has been treated effectively.",
    "prevention": "Ticks are most active in the warmer months (April to September) but it is advisable to take precautions against Lyme disease throughout the year, particularly in areas where it is prevalent. The most effective precaution to take against LD is to minimise contact with ticks. When spending time outside, avoid wooded and brushy areas with high grass. If people must spend time outside, walking in the center of trails where the grass is flatter can reduce the chances of contact with infected ticks. It is also advisable to use a repellent containing 20 percent DEET or more in order to protect clothing and exposed skin from ticks. It is advisable to choose a repellent that lasts for several hours. Take care to avoid the eyes and mouth when applying it. On clothing, use products containing the insect-repellent chemical permethrin at a strength of 0.5 percent. Clothing which already contains the protective permethrin can be purchased, and the effect may last longer. After spending time outside in long grass, a person should check for ticks and ask family or friends to check any areas they can’t see, such as behind the ears. If a tick is found on the body, it is advisable to remove it as soon as possible. Rapid removal of a tick can prevent infection with LD. To remove a tick: 5 Disinfect the site where the tick has attached with rubbing alcohol Use tweezers with pointed ends to hold the tick close to where it enters the skin Pull the tick out slowly and carefully Disinfect the site of the tick bite again. Pets can be vaccinated against Lyme disease and treated to prevent ticks from hiding in their fur. Although pets cannot pass LD on to humans directly, these measures are helpful for minimising exposure to infected ticks.",
    "complications_after_a_lyme_disease_infection": "In rare cases. it is possible, for a person to develop further medical conditions after the onset of LD, sometimes months or years after the infection itself has cleared up. Complications are usually a consequence of untreated or late LD and the result of the infection being present within the body for an extended period of time. Conditions which a person affected by LD is at risk of developing may include:\n\nThis condition characterized by painful swelling in the joints can appear weeks or months after the onset of LD. It is much more likely for people who have been affected by LD to develop Lyme arthritis, which can be treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, than systemic arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 6 Read more about Arthritis »\n\nThis inflammatory skin condition is characterized by red, swollen skin, which is particularly likely to affect the extremities of the body, such as the hands and feet. Over time, the continual inflammation of ACA causes skin tissue to be lost. However, in the early stages, this condition is treatable with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline, and the changes to the skin are reversible. 7\n\nAlso known as nervous system Lyme disease , this is a neurological condition in which intense nerve pain radiates out from the spine. Recent research suggests that effective antibiotic treatment of early LD can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing BS. 8\n\nIt is possible for Lyme disease to develop into Chronic Lyme Disease Complex (CLDC). This is unlikely to occur if LD is diagnosed and treated early. CLDC is more commonly associated with late lyme disease. In cases of CLDC, Lyme disease infection co-occurs alongside other conditions with similar symptoms. These include autoimmune conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia , a rheumatic condition typified by muscle and joint pain. To treat CLDC, it is necessary to identify and treat each condition involved.",
    "lyme_disease_faqs": "Q: Is Lyme disease curable? A: Yes. The earlier a diagnosis is made, the easier it is to treat Lyme disease and its symptoms. Although diagnosing and treating LD becomes more complex as it progresses due to worsening of the symptoms and the possibility of developing other concurrent conditions, LD can be completely cured at any stage. Q: Is there a vaccine for Lyme disease? A: There is not currently a vaccine for Lyme disease available for humans. The first vaccine for Lyme disease, called Lymerix, was released in 1998. It was withdrawn after four years in response to public outcry following unsubstantiated claims linking the vaccine to arthritis. A new vaccine for LD is being developed by Valevna, a French biotech company, but it will not be available for 6 or more years. The vaccine will mimic the function of the formula currently used to prevent animals from contracting LD, which works by neutralising the B. burgdorferi bacteria within the feeding tick. Pets that have been vaccinated against Lyme disease may still pass infected ticks on to humans from their fur. Q: Where in the US am I most at risk of contracting Lyme disease? A: The blacklegged tick, or deer tick, Ixodes scapularis, spreads the disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States. The western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus) spreads the disease on the Pacific Coast.

    "condition": "Malaria",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/malaria/",
    "what_is_malaria": "Malaria is a serious disease which occurs almost exclusively in the tropics and subtropics. It is caused by infection with a parasite called Plasmodium, which is spread through the bite of female mosquitoes that carry it. 1 The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that about half the world’s population was at risk in 2016. 2 Most cases of malaria occur in those who live in or have visited sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. However, the Eastern Mediterranean, Oceania, and the Americas are also risk areas. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report approximately 1700 cases of malaria annually. 1 The main symptoms of malaria are fever and a flu-like illness. If a person experiences symptoms of malaria after traveling to an affected area (see map of affected areas , they should consult a medical practitioner as quickly as possible.\n\nLeft untreated, malaria can cause severe complications , leading to a poor prognosis with a high mortality. However, it has an excellent prognosis if diagnosed early and treated appropriately. Malaria is typically preventable with the use of antimalarial drugs when a person visits endemic areas. Mosquito repellent and insect nets should be used during the night since the mosquitoes that transmit malaria bite mainly during the night. Symptoms usually appear within a couple of weeks of becoming infected but can sometimes take much longer. The period may vary, depending on host factors and the causative species, so malaria disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all cases of fever within a year of visiting an affected area.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Malaria symptoms typically manifest within a few weeks after infection , although the host’s previous exposure or immunity to malaria will affect their symptoms and incubation period. In some cases, the parasite may lie dormant and not cause symptoms for many months, even up to a year after traveling in an area where malaria is present.\n\nSigns and symptoms of malaria typically include: Piques of very high fever Shaking chills Sweats Paroxysms – sudden recurrences or attacks of fever, shaking chills and sweats together – occur every 24, 48 or 72 hours, depending on the parasite species. Each paroxysm lasts approximately one to two hours and occurs in three successive stages. The first is characterized by shivering and a feeling of cold. This is followed by a pique of high fever. After the patient experiences excessive sweating to an unusual degree, the temperature goes back to normal or even below normal. Sometimes, in early infection, patients don’t experience this, but may have several piques of fever during the day. Headache Cough Fatigue Arthralgia (painful joints) Muscle pain.\n\nIn some cases, a person may also experience: 3 Abdominal pain Lethargy, meaning sleeplessness or deep unresponsiveness and inactivity Nausea Vomiting Diarrhea, especially in children Anemia Jaundice Shortness of breath Loss of appetite. Life-threatening complications can result from malaria if it is left untreated or if it is malignant malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. This may include respiratory distress, liver failure, kidney failure, and shock, as well as very serious brain and central nervous system problems. Often, abdominal pain occurs in the first week or two of malaria . This is caused mostly by inflammation of the liver and spleen. Large numbers of red blood cells become sequestered in the liver and the spleen, as well as other major organs. If the spleen becomes very enlarged, it may rupture, causing massive internal bleeding that requires emergency treatment. 4",
    "what_causes_malaria": "Human malaria is caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium, specifically species P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, P. vivax and P. knowlesi, which is normally spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. Just one bite from an infected mosquito can lead to malaria. Only female Anopheles mosquitoes can transmit malaria. When a mosquito bites an infected person, it takes in a small amount of blood, which contains microscopic malaria parasites. About one week later, when the mosquito takes its next blood meal, these parasites mix with the mosquito’s saliva and are injected into the person being bitten. Not every infectious mosquito bite will result in malaria. The number of parasites each mosquito carries influences the chance of successful malaria infection. Some mosquitoes can be highly infected, making them particularly likely to pass on the disease. Mosquito-transmitted malaria also depends on certain climatic features, such as sufficiently high temperatures and humidity for Anopheles mosquitoes to multiply and survive. This is why malaria occurs in warmer, tropical areas. Hot weather also encourages human behavior that can increase contact with Anopheles mosquitoes between dusk and dawn, the time when malaria-causing mosquitoes mostly bite. Examples include outside activities like camping, sleeping outside and also wearing light and short clothes that lead to more skin being uncovered and more exposed to a possible mosquito bite. In rare cases, malaria transmission can occur from person to person, without requiring passage through a mosquito. This can only occur through blood, such as in the following scenarios: Organ transplants Blood transfusions Needle sharing From mother to unborn child in congenital malaria. Cases of infection secondary to transfusion of infected blood are extremely rare. 5",
    "types": "Each species of malaria varies in the typical length of time after the infecting mosquito bite before symptoms appear. Parasites can linger, grow, and multiply  in the liver cells for months before they are released into the red blood cells. This is known as the incubation period. Once in the blood, each malaria parasite species varies in its typical replication cycle length, during which newly replicated parasites erupt out of red blood cells. This results in regular spikes in fever, known as the fever cycle. Some species of Plasmodium can cause relapses because they have dormant stages in the liver, known as hypnozoites, that can activate and invade the blood several months or years after the infecting mosquito bite. Malaria is also divided into two general types: benign malaria and malignant malaria. Benign malaria is typically milder and easier to treat. The five main species of the Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans are: P. falciparum: This is a malignant form of malaria and can be very severe and sometimes fatal. Normally, the incubation period is about 7 - 14 days, but it can be up to one year. The fever cycle is at first irregular and usually daily. After about a week, the fever returns every third day. This type of malaria does not cause relapse. P. Vivax: This is mostly benign. Normally, the incubation period is about 12 - 17 days, followed by a fever that recurs every third day. This species can cause relapse. P. ovale: This is mostly benign. Normall,y the incubation period is about 15 - 18 days, followed by a fever that recurs every third day. This species can cause relapse. P. malariae: This is mostly benign. Normally, the incubation period is about 18 - 40 days, followed by a fever that recurs every fourth day. If untreated, this species can remain in the body, causing symptoms for many years. P. knowlesi: This is a malignant form of malaria and can be very severe and sometimes fatal. Normally, the incubation period is about 9 - 12 days, followed by a fever that recurs every day. This species of malaria does not cause relapse. 6",
    "how_is_malaria_diagnosed": "As there are no symptoms that are specific to the disease, it is important that a person see a doctor and mention the possibility of malaria if they experience fever within a year of visiting an affected area. Other infections may present with similar symptoms, such as typhoid fever , HIV, dengue fever, meningitis/encephalitis, or viral hemorrhagic fevers, in which blood vessels rupture. Most missed malarial infections are wrongly diagnosed as nonspecific viral infections, influenza, gastroenteritis , or hepatitis. Try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment. A doctor will typically review the person’s medical history and ask about recent travel to tropical climates. A physical exam will also be performed to determine if the spleen or liver is enlarged. A blood test may be done to confirm the diagnosis. After examination in a laboratory, blood samples can generally show : If malaria is present What type of malaria is present If the infection is caused by a variation of the parasite that is resistant to certain types of drugs If the infection has caused anemia If the infection has affected any vital organs Accurate diagnosis of malaria presence and the type of Plasmodium infection is important: To ensure appropriate treatment for the best outcome Due to concerns of increasing drug resistance, which is widespread in malaria-endemic areas Sometimes malaria does not show up immediately in a blood test. This happens especially in pregnant people, where the parasite can be present in high numbers in the placenta without being apparent in the rest of the body. 7 If no malaria is seen in the blood sample, another blood test may be taken a couple of days later.",
    "malaria_treatment": "It may be possible to treat malaria at home if symptoms are mild. However, if the infection is caused by Plasmodium falciparum or there are any complications, the person will generally need to be treated and monitored in a hospital. If promptly diagnosed and treated, most people will make a full recovery from malaria. However, treatment may make a person feel weak and tired for several weeks after the infection is gone. There are various types of antimalarial medication available. Which medication is prescribed to treat malaria will depend on: The subtype of plasmodium parasite causing it Whether any antimalarial medications have been taken when traveling The severity of symptoms More than one type of medication, or an alternative, may be given if a person experiences side-effects, or if the infecting parasite shows resistance to a particular drug. Many of the same medications used to prevent malaria can also be used to treat the disease. However, if you've taken a particular malaria pill to prevent malaria, you shouldn't take the same one to treat it. Certain types of malaria, such as Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, have stages in the malaria life cycle where the parasite can live dormant in the liver for several months, even years, and reactivate later, causing a relapse of malaria. If found to have one of these types of malaria, a person will usually be given medication to prevent relapse. It is possible to be given emergency treatment to take along if traveling to remote places and use it to treat suspected malaria until medical care is available.",
    "malaria_prevention": "Malaria prophylaxis is the preventive treatment of malaria. The main ways to prevent malaria are through taking malaria pills, known as chemoprophylaxis, and avoidance of mosquito bites. There is currently no malaria vaccine available, though development efforts for several malaria vaccines are ongoing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends five principles, known as the ABCDE of malaria prophylaxis: A wareness. When travelling to a malaria-affected area, be aware of the risk of malaria, the malaria incubation period, the possibility of delayed onset, and the main symptoms. B ite prevention. Use an effective mosquito repellent, such as diethyltoluamide (DEET), and mosquito nets when sleeping. C hemoprophylaxis. Take antimalarial drugs when appropriate, starting at least two weeks before entering a malarious area and following the drug’s daily or weekly dosing interval. D iagnosis. Seek immediate diagnosis and treatment if a fever develops one week or more after entering an area where there is a malaria risk and up to three months or even later, after departure from a risk area, although symptoms rarely occur after more than three months. E nvironments. Avoid being in or near mosquito breeding areas, such as swamps or marshy areas, particularly in late evenings and at night. Most frequently, travelers develop malaria because they have not taken their antimalarial medication correctly, either because some doses may have been missed, or the tablets were not taken for the advised length of time before entering or after leaving a malaria-affected area. Malaria prophylaxis drugs are usually well tolerated, but can result in side-effects in some people. The most common side-effects experienced include nausea and diarrhea. Some antimalarial drugs can increase sun sensitivity, making it important to use a higher factor sunscreen, while others might lead to sleep problems and headaches. Antimalarial medication is not always 100 percent effective, which is why it is important to practice bite prevention when in a malaria-endemic area. Diethyltoluamide (DEET) is the most effective insect repellent. However, for proper usage of DEET on adults, babies and children over 2 months of age, adhere to the label instructions and/or the product manual for sufficient protection.\" Other behaviors that will reduce the risk of a person being bitten include: Using mosquito nets while sleeping, especially those treated with insecticide, ensuring that there are no holes. Covering up any bare skin if outside after sunset. Sleeping in an air-conditioned room, as the lowered temperature discourages mosquitoes. Putting screens on doors, windows and other possible mosquito entry routes. Spraying the bedroom with an insecticide before sleep to kill any mosquitoes that may have entered during the day. Using an electrically-heated device to vaporise a tablet containing pyrethroid insecticide in the room at night. Good to know: Herbal and homeopathic remedies have not been shown to be effective for malaria prevention or treatment and are not recommended.",
    "malaria_faqs": "Q: Is malaria contagious? A: No, malaria transmission cannot take place in the same way as a cold or the flu, because the malaria parasite is not found in an infected person’s saliva. Nor can it be sexually transmitted. The only way that malaria can spread from one person to another is through blood, as with blood transfusions, organ transplants, needle sharing or if it is acquired by an unborn child from its mother. Otherwise, malaria is normally transmitted by being bitten by a female Anopheles mosquito, infected through a previous blood meal taken from an infected person. Q: Is there a malaria vaccine? A: The world’s first malaria vaccine, known as RTS,S, is being piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, starting in 2018. However, it is not otherwise available yet. Despite many decades of research and development efforts, there is currently no commercially available malaria vaccine. The complexity of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, makes development of a malaria vaccine very difficult. Q: Can a person acquire immunity to malaria through exposure? A: After repeated attacks of malaria, a person may develop semi-immunity. Such a person can often still be infected by malaria parasites, but may not develop severe disease. After time spent away from a malaria-endemic area, this acquired immunity will gradually disappear. Many cases of malaria in travelers are acquired by people who have moved to an area without malaria, visited the malaria-affected areas where they grew up and not taken antimalarial tablets because they assumed they were still immune. Q: Is malaria caused by a virus or bacteria? A: Malaria is not caused by a virus or bacteria. Malaria is caused by a parasite known as Plasmodium, which is normally spread through infected mosquitoes. A mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human, taking in Plasmodia which are in the blood. About a week later, the mosquito takes another blood meal and injects the Plasmodia into the body of another person, spreading the malaria disease."

    "condition": "Measles (Rubeola)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/measles/",
    "what_is_measles": "Measles is a highly infectious, viral illness. Children are most often affected, although it can occur at any age. Although the illness is unpleasant, most people make a full recovery. However, in certain cases, serious complications can develop.\n\nVaccination programs have had a huge impact on reducing the number of cases of measles. 1 However, measles is still a common disease in many other countries. The measles virus is contained in water droplets and most often spread through the nose or mouth of an infected person. Physical contact, coughing, and sneezing are the most common causes of infection spreading. People with measles typically experience flu-like symptoms, such as a runny nose and coughing,  fever, feeling generally unwel,l and a gradual rash. The symptoms of measles usually get better within seven to 10 days.",
    "types": "There are two types of measles . Although they share some of the same symptoms, they are caused by different viruses: Standard measles, sometimes known as red measles, or hard measles, is caused by the rubeola virus. German measles, also known as rubella , is an entirely separate illness caused by the rubella virus and is usually a milder infection than standard measles. 2 For more information, read this resource on rubella.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Once an affected person has caught measles, the virus multiplies in the back of the throat and begins to spread gradually throughout the body. It can take up to 10 days for an infected person to show symptoms. The most common early symptoms of measles are: 3 4 Cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and coughing A high temperature or fever Sore, red eyes Sensitivity to light Grey-white spots inside the cheeks, mouth, and throat Nausea Tiredness Lack of appetite Aches and pains Around three to four days after the first symptoms, a skin rash will normally begin to appear. The rash is perhaps the most noticeable symptom of measles and is recognizable by: 3 Red-brown spots, either flat or slightly raised, that may join together to form blotches Spots usually start on the head and neck and then gradually spread downwards through the rest of the body The rash may turn pale when pressed at first, but will gradually fade and become non-blanching (stays red when pressed) Slight itching\n\nGenerally, measles rash takes two to three days to cover the body and then another few days to fade, beginning on the head and disappearing in the same order in which it appeared. As other symptoms begin earlier, affected people usually feel most unwell on the first or second day that the rash is present. Symptoms of measles usually begin to appear on average around seven to 14 days after  becoming infected. However, affected people are usually infectious four days before to four days after the measles rash appears. 3 Overall, most people with measles feel better within seven to 10 days of first experiencing symptoms. On occasion, a dry cough may persist after all other symptoms have gone. During the measles infection, the immune system builds up a resistance to the virus. It is therefore highly unlikely for anyone to have measles more than once in their lifetime. 3",
    "what_causes_measles": "Measles is caused by a viral infection, and is highly contagious. It is estimated that around 90 percent of unvaccinated people close to someone who is in the contagious phase of measles will also become infected. 5 Measles is transmitted in a similar way to colds and flu , i.e. breathing in the airborne water droplets coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. Although physical contact, coughing and sneezing are the most common causes of infection spreading, it is also possible to contract measles simply by breathing in contaminated air, or touching a contaminated surface and then breathing in the droplets. The measles virus can live for up to two hours on surfaces and in airspace. 5",
    "what_are_the_risk_factors": "Measles is very rare in countries that have a vaccination program. In recent decades, the number of measles cases in the United States has significantly declined due to the introduction of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. However the disease has not been completely eradicated. In 2017 there were 120 reported cases of measles in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The majority of these cases were in people who were unvaccinated. 6 Unvaccinated people are at most risk of contracting measles, in particular people with a weakened immune system. Unvaccinated pregnant women should also be especially cautious. Pregnant women with measles may develop serious complications that can result in miscarriage or premature labor . See more below.",
    "measles_diagnosis": "A doctor will usually look for a combination of characteristic symptoms such as a skin rash, fever and cough to diagnose measles. However, a blood or saliva test is the only way to definitively confirm the diagnosis. 7 These tests check for I mmunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G antibody levels , both of which may indicate the current or past presence of measles. 8 If measles is suspected , it is important to call the surgeon and tell the staff when making a doctor’s appointment. Because measles is very contagious, it is common for medical professionals to ask initial questions over the phone to help them decide how likely the diagnosis of measles is, and whether a trip to the surgery can be avoided. If an appointment with a doctor is necessary, the doctor may make special arrangements, such as a home visit, in order to reduce the risk of infecting other patients. 9",
    "what_are_the_treatments_for_measles": "There is no specific medicine used to treat measles. Because the disease is viral and not bacterial, antibiotics are not effective. Treatment for measles instead aims to manage and ease the symptoms until the body’s natural immune system can clear the infection. Symptoms usually improve within seven to 10 days. Typical treatment recommendations include: 3 10 2 Plenty of bed rest to help boost the immune system Drinking lots of fluids such as water, fruit juices and herbal teas, to prevent dehydration and help ease a sore throat; alcohol and caffeine should be avoided Closing curtains and dimming lights to control sensitivity to light A humidifier or sitting in a steamy bathroom to help ease a cough or sore throat Ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen may be recommended to relieve fever and aches Vitamin A supplements may be recommended to people suffering from measles, particularly children, in order to lessen the severity of the condition and the risk of complications 11 Please note that ingesting a high amount of vitamin A can result in a condition called hypervitaminosis A, or vitamin A toxicity. This is usually the result of a person taking high-dose dietary supplements, so always discuss vitamin A supplementation with a doctor before starting. 12",
    "measles_prevention": "The best precaution against measles is to be vaccinated against it.\n\nThe most common vaccine is the MMR vaccine, which immunizes against measles, mumps and rubella. According to CDC, two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97 percent effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is about 93 percent effective. 1 In countries with a vaccination program, the MMR vaccine is first administered to children around 12-15 months, with a second, booster dose when they are between four to six years old. 1 For babies travelling to countries with a high rate of measles infection, the first dose of the vaccine may be given as early as six months old. Adults can request the measles vaccine from their doctors if they have never been immunized. There is a further vaccine called MMRV, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox). Currently this vaccine is only licensed for use in children aged between 12 months and 12 years old. 1\n\nThe measles virus remains common in many countries in the world, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. Measles outbreaks in the United States most often occur when returning travellers spread the disease to other unvaccinated people, having contracted the illness in another country. It is best to take precautions to reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the measles virus when travelling internationally. The most important of these is to receive the MMR vaccination prior to travelling. Children can receive their first dose at six months old when travelling internationally. Other ways to help prevent illness include: Wash hands frequently, ideally with soap and water, or alternatively hand sanitiser Cover the mouth and nose with a tissue, not the hands, when coughing and sneezing Avoid contact with people who are sick, especially close contact such as kissing, hugging and sharing cooking or eating utensils Do not touch the eyes, nose or mouth unless your hands are fully clean\n\nThe benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks, but side effects are possible. These commonly include: 13 Aching, sore arm from the shot Short term, mild rash Temporary stiffness in the joints. Most commonly affects teenage and adult women Fever Less common side effects include: 13 Fits caused by fever , such as febrile seizures . These are rare and are not a sign of any long-term health problems A temporary low platelet count which affects the blood’s ability to clot. Again this is rare and usually goes away without treatment or any long-term issues Swelling of the glands in the cheeks, neck or jaw for a couple of days In very rare cases, a person may have a serious allergic reaction after a dose of the MMR vaccine. For this reason, anyone who has had an allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine may be advised not be vaccinated. 14 If there are any concerns about the MMR vaccine and allergies, it is important to discuss these with a doctor. Despite concerns that the MMR vaccine may cause autistic spectrum disorders, multiple studies have shown there is no link between being vaccinated and developing autism . 15\n\nDue to how contagious the measles virus is, it is important to limit the risk of spreading the infection to others. Symptoms of measles usually begin to appear on average around seven to 14 days after first becoming infected. However, affected people are usually infectious four days before to four days after the measles rash appears. 3 For this reason, people with this condition should stay home from the moment symptoms begin to appear until four days after the rash disappears. 5 Friends, family, co-workers, classmates, carers and teachers should be notified if they may have come into contact with someone who has measles during the infectious period. This is particularly important if they are a vulnerable person. Contact with vulnerable people such as young children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems should be especially limited.",
    "measles_complications": "In the majority of cases, people with the measles virus make a full recovery after around seven to 10 days and will experience no further complications. However, serious complications which can be life-threatening do occur. Measles complications can happen at any age, but are more likely to occur in certain groups of people , such as: 3 7 Children younger than five years old Children who have a poor diet or are malnourished Children with a weakened immune system, such as those with leukaemia or HIV Adults older than 20 years of age Pregnant women\n\nThere are a number of common complications that may arise from measles, such as: 16 17 3 Vomiting and diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration Eye infection, conjunctivitis Ear infection, otitis media , which can lead to earache Inflammation of the voice box, laryngitis While these symptoms can be distressing, they are not usually serious. However, affected people should see a doctor if they are concerned.\n\nMore uncommon complications from measles may include: 16 17 3 A squint, if the measles virus affects the nerves or muscles of the eye Fits caused by fever, such as febrile seizures Inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis Infection of the airways and lungs, such as pneumonia , bronchitis or croup, which can be very serious\n\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to: 18 19 20 Serious eye disorders such as infection of the optic nerve, which can lead to blindness Infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord, such as viral meningitis Inflammation of the brain, or encephalitis, affects roughly 1-3 out of every 1,000 cases Central nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) which can develop several years after contracting measles. This disease can be fatal but is extremely rare, occurring in roughly two per 100,000 cases If any concerning symptoms develop, always contact a doctor.\n\nPregnant women who contract measles have an increased risk of developing serious complications which can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth or premature labor. 21 The CDC guidelines recommend that the MMR vaccine be administered to unvaccinated women no less than a month before becoming pregnant. The MMR vaccine not only protects against measles, but also against mumps and rubella. Rubella can also cause severe problems during pregnancy, including birth defects, miscarriage and stillbirth. 13",
    "measles_faqs": "Q: Are measles and German measles the same? A: No. Measles, also known as rubeola, and German measles, also known as rubella, are two completely separate illnesses. They do have certain symptoms in common, including: Cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing and coughing A high temperature or fever Sore, red eyes A skin rash They are also both spread in the airborne water droplets coughed or sneezed out by an infected person, as well as prevented by the MMR vaccine. However, they are caused by different viruses and have different specific symptoms, complications and treatments. Q: What does the measles rash look like? A: The measles rash is characterized by red-brown spots that may join together to form blotches. It is usual for spots to first appear on the head and then gradually spread down throughout the body. For some people the rash will be slightly itchy, but this is not always the case. Generally the rash takes around two to three days to cover the body and then another few days to fade in order of appearance. Q: Is there a vaccine against measles? A: Yes. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and two doses of the vaccine have been shown to be around 97 percent effective at preventing measles. Children aged between 12 months and 12 years old may also get the MMRV vaccine, which immunizes against measles, mumps,  rubella and varicella (chickenpox) . Q: What is the treatment for measles? A: Because there is no medication that targets the measles virus, most treatment focuses on managing and easing the symptoms of measles. Q: What precautions can be taken against measles? A: The only way to prevent measles is by having a vaccination. Measles is very contagious, so it is important for people with this condition to stay home from the moment symptoms begin to appear to four days after the rash disappears. Other useful preventative methods include: Washing hands frequently, ideally with soap and water or hand sanitizer Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth unless hands are fully clean"

    "condition": "Melanoma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/melanoma/",
    "what_is_melanoma": "Melanoma, also called malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma , is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, over 91,000 new diagnoses of melanoma will be confirmed in the U.S. in 2018. 1 It is much more common for adults to be affected by melanoma than children. The condition is primarily caused by prolonged, frequent or intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or artificial sources such as tanning beds. The name melanoma derives from the skin cells called melanocytes. Melanoma is the only type of skin cancer which develops from melanocyte cells, which are one of the three main types of skin cells in the epidermis, the top layer of skin. When functioning normally, melanocytes produce the pigment melanin, which protects the skin from sunburn/UV light and gives the skin and hair their coloring. The production of melanin causes the changes in the skin that typically occur after exposure to UV radiation, usually from sunlight. These changes may include tanning, moles, freckles and patches where the skin lightens and/or darkens unevenly. These changes are, in most instances, benign. However, excessive exposure to UV radiation can cause changes in the DNA in the melanocyte cells, so that rather than producing healthy quantities of melanin, they grow and reproduce uncontrollably, becoming cancerous. Even if the changes to one’s skin appear healthy, such as in the case of a tan, exposure to UV radiation can cause melanoma to develop later on. People with fair skin, red or blond hair, and those who spend a lot of time in strong sunlight, are at higher risk of developing melanoma than those with darker complexions. The diagnosis of melanoma is confirmed by taking a sample (biopsy) for testing. Treatment and prognosis both depend on the level of advancement of the condition at diagnosis; the earlier melanoma is detected, the better the probable treatment outcome. If diagnosed early, surgery to remove the skin tissue affected by melanoma in its entirety may cure a person of this condition. If diagnosed at a later stage, when the melanoma has spread to a greater area of skin and/or internally, chemotherapy is often necessary. Avoiding prolonged periods of sun exposure, as well as exposure to other UV radiation such as tanning beds, is the best means of preventing melanoma. Good to know: Always seek medical attention if melanoma is suspected. However, most of the changes that occur to the skin as a result of sun exposure, such as the appearance of new freckles and moles, are not indicative of melanoma: See this resource on benign moles for more information about the various types of non-cancerous skin growths. See this resource on signs of melanoma for more information about spotting skin and mole abnormalities that may indicate melanoma.",
    "symptoms": "Melanoma can develop anywhere on the body, including under the nails and toenails. The condition usually first appears on the skin ‒ in moles or the skin itself ‒ but can spread internally. Melanoma can usually be detected by monitoring changes to the skin, which often occur in areas that are frequently exposed to the sun such as the arms, legs, face and back. Early signs of melanoma include a change in an existing mole or the development of a new, dark spot, mole or freckle on the skin. These moles are often asymmetric, have an irregular border, and they may change in color, get bigger or change in some other way. Hidden melanomas may occur on soles of feet, palms of hands, in fingernail beds or in the mouth, eye and digestive or urinary tract. The four main types of melanoma in skin are: 2 Superficial spreading melanoma: This is the most common type of melanoma, most commonly affecting the skin on the chest, back and limbs. Nodular melanoma: This is the second most common type of melanoma and can metastasize (spread) rapidly. It is most likely to be found on the chest, head, neck and/or back, and tends to redden, rather than darken, as it advances. Lentigo maligna melanoma: This is a slow-growing, rarer type of melanoma which most often affects older people who have spent long or intense periods of time exposed to UV radiation. It develops from a precancerous skin blemish called a lentigo maligna which looks like a liver spot or stain. Acral lentiginous melanoma: This is the rarest type of skin-based melanoma and is also described as hidden melanoma. It usually occurs in unexpected areas such as the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or the fingernail and toenail beds, and most commonly affects people with darker skin. It is not thought to be related to sun exposure. It is also possible for melanoma to develop without initially causing any changes to the skin. Forms of melanoma which do not usually first result in skin changes include: Ocular melanoma, in the eyes Mucosal melanoma, in the nose, mouth, vaginal or anal passages Internal melanoma, where the cancer grows or develops inside the body without first exhibiting any visual indicators on the skin If you think that you or a loved one may have a melanome, get a free assessment with the Ada app .\n\nMelanoma in children is rare, affecting only around 300 children per year on average in the U.S. 3 As with adults, children with fair skin and red or blond hair are at greater risk of developing melanoma than children with darker complexions. In children, the blemishes that indicate melanoma are often different to the signs of melanoma in adults. They are primarily paler: yellow, white or pink sores or bumps on the skin that bleed, itch or do not heal are the most common sign of melanoma in children. As with adults, diagnosing melanoma in children as early as possible in its development is key to increasing the likelihood of successful treatment.",
    "causes_and_risk_factors": "The primary cause of melanoma is thought to be exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. There are a number of genetic and personal factors which render it more likely that a person develops melanoma. These include being fair-skinned and/or being prone to developing moles. People who have already been diagnosed with melanoma on one occasion are also more likely to develop the condition again. 4\n\nThe primary cause of melanoma is believed to be exposure to a type of ultraviolet (UV) radiation called UVB radiation. 5 People who use tanning devices that involve UV radiation, such as sunbeds, or who spend long periods of time in the sun, particularly during childhood, should be aware that they are at increased risk of developing melanoma and should perform monthly body scans to check for associated skin abnormalities. 6 Sources of UV radiation which may contribute to the development of melanoma include: 7 Sunlight Sunbeds Ultraviolet nail curing lamps Sun lamps Bactericidal lamps Black light lamps Limiting the extent of one’s exposure to UV radiation by taking adequate precautions to protect the skin, such as wearing a high-factor sunscreen lotion and avoiding tanning treatments that involve UV radiation, can help to reduce the likelihood of developing melanoma. People who have experienced severe or frequent sunburn during childhood are at increased risk of developing the condition later on. 1 Professionals at increased risk of developing melanoma, due to working in environments involving radiation, include: 7 8 Construction workers Agricultural workers Salon workers Airline staff, particularly pilots Lighting technicians Dentists and assistants Office workers, due to fixed seating, sometimes in direct sunlight\n\nFactors in a person’s medical history that indicate an increased risk of developing melanoma include: 9 A medical history of developing cancerous or precancerous moles A previous diagnosis of melanoma A weakened immune system, such as is caused by an autoimmune disease, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) A previous or current diagnosis of another form of skin cancer such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma A previous or current diagnosis of any other kind of cancer There has not been sufficient collection of data to verify the widespread conception that people with a family history of melanoma are more likely to be affected by the condition. 10\n\nTraits which make a person more likely to develop melanoma include: 11 12 Red or blond hair Fair skin Skin which is sensitive to the sun and/or unable to tan Skin which develops freckles in the sun Blue or green eyes\n\nPeople with certain complexions, or with a tendency to develop certain types of moles, are at increased risk of developing melanoma. These include: 13 Having atypical moles Having large moles Having over 50 moles Regularly developing new moles after exposure to UV radiation See this resource on benign moles for more information about how to identify whether a mole is non-cancerous or a potential cause for concern. Always consult a doctor if unsure about whether a mole has changed.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosing melanoma as early as possible in its development greatly increases the chances that it can be treated effectively and that a person can make a full recovery. 14 Due to the fact that potentially cancerous moles may turn out to be benign and that many symptoms of melanoma are also symptomatic of other conditions, melanoma can be difficult to diagnose. It is therefore important to consult a medical professional if one suspects one might be affected by melanoma, so that the diagnostic process can begin, especially if one is at increased risk due to being fair skinned, having experienced significant exposure to UV radiation and/or having a family of history of melanoma.\n\nAfter performing a physical examination and taking a person’s medical history, the doctor will usually next perform a biopsy (tissue analysis) of the area where the melanoma is suspected. The procedure involves removing tissue from the skin and may involve the removal of an entire mole or skin growth. The sample will then be analyzed for the presence of melanoma. A biopsy to detect melanoma is most often carried out by a type of skin doctor called a dermatopathologist. A report on the characteristics of the sample will be produced to enable the doctor to determine the presence of melanoma and the possible extent to which it may have advanced. The doctor will then strategize the most appropriate treatment plan for the affected individual. 15 There are several different kinds of skin biopsy, including optical, shave, punch, incisional and excisional biopsies, which can be used to test for melanoma. These involve different methods and extents of removing the skin. 16 The doctor will consider factors like an individual’s age, the location of the suspected melanoma on the body and the size of skin area which will need to be removed. It is important to remove as much as possible of the area that is thought to be affected by melanoma in order to maximize the probability of making an accurate diagnosis.\n\nIn cases where the likelihood of a confirmed diagnosis of melanoma is moderate to high, doctors will use an excisional biopsy where possible, as this method makes it possible to remove the suspected tumor in its entirety. Excisional biopsies are ideal in cases where the melanoma is thought to be confined to a small area of the body, and are not viable in cases where the melanoma is thought to affect a large area of skin or to have already spread to other areas. If the melanoma is believed to have spread, a different kind of biopsy will be carried out to gauge its stage of advancement.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of melanoma has been made ‒ or if melanoma is already suspected to have become metastatic before the initial diagnosis is made ‒ the doctor will need to determine the stage to which the condition may have advanced. This involves discerning how big the melanoma is/are and whether it has spread to other areas of the body, including internal organs and lymph nodes. The lymphatic system is a crucial element of the body’s immune system. Lymph is interstitial fluid which, in healthy people, bathes the body’s cells in essential substances like protein, blood plasma and oxygen. When lymph passes through the lymphatic system to reach the lymph nodes, bacteria, viruses and cancer can be detected. Many types of cancer, including melanoma, can spread through the lymphatic system. The presence of melanoma in the lymph nodes therefore indicates the potential spread of the cancer to other areas of the body. Finding out whether the cancer has already spread to other areas of the body is crucial in order to determine the prognosis, i.e. how likely and how fully a person is to recover, and the most appropriate course of treatment. The kinds of biopsies used to determine the spread of melanoma are often more extensive than those that analyze a specific area of skin. When determining how far a cancer has spread, a Roman numerical system will be used to rate the severity of the cancer from the least advanced stages 0 and I (1), through to cancers which have already spread greatly ,stages III (3) and IV (4). Hereafter, in this resource, the stages will be referenced with Arabic numerals. Having established the overall stage, doctors will then grade the condition alphabetically (A-C) depending, again, on characteristics that relate to its severity. The lower their melanoma is rated, the better a person’s prognosis will be. For example, stage 1A melanoma has a five-year survival rate of 97%, meaning that 97% of people with melanoma survive for a minimum of five years and possibly many more after diagnosis, whereas stage 1B melanoma has a five-year survival rate of around 92%. 17 Biopsies to test the stage of melanoma may include:\n\nThis procedure involves removing a sample of fluid or tissue from the area just under the skin with the use of a fine needle. It can usually be carried out under local anesthetic with no complications. FNA is considered to be one of the most rapid and accurate ways to examine the possible metastasis (spread) of suspicious lesions. When testing for melanoma, doctors will look for changes to the lesion’s cells, such as altered cell shape.\n\nAlteration in the sensation and shape of the lymph nodes is a possible indicator of the spread of melanoma. An excisional lymph node biopsy is a surgical procedure which involves removing all or part of a lymph node that has become suspicious. Analysis will reveal whether the changes are due to the spread of melanoma. 18 Local or general anesthetic will be used before an incision is made in the skin near the lymph node, and the relevant section of the lymph node is removed for analysis. The surgical site will be closed with a suture.\n\nSentinel lymph node is a term used to describe any lymph node to which the cancer is most likely to spread first. In a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the relevant node will be identified, removed and assessed for the presence of melanoma. It is possible for a person to have more than one sentinel lymph node, and an SLNB procedure may involve the removal and analysis of one or more sentinel lymph node(s). 19 During the procedure, radioactive material and/or a colored dye will be injected at the site of the melanoma and a device that detects radioactivity will be used to identify the sentinel lymph node(s), which can then be surgically removed. A negative result of an SLNB test, in which no lymph nodes are detected to be radioactive and/or become colored by the dye, implies that the melanoma has not yet spread to the lymph nodes. This enables doctors to deem it unlikely for the melanoma to have reached other areas within the body. 19",
    "melanoma_treatment_and_management": "The treatment approach required for melanoma depends on the extent to which it has spread. It may be possible to remove the entirety of the affected area(s) with surgery. However, melanoma that has spread to multiple sites or advanced within the body may require a combined approach. Treatment options for melanoma will depend on the overall health of the individual, their specific medical circumstances and the advancement of their melanoma. After melanoma has been removed, if this is possible, periodical screenings are often necessary in order to check whether melanoma has come back (recurrent melanoma). This is carried out with MRI and/or CT scans, and is called surveillance imaging. 20 Recurrent melanoma after successful treatment for early-stage melanoma is rare, but possible; people who have already been affected by melanoma are at greater risk of melanoma than the general population. Consult the medical staff involved in the treatment for a personalized estimate of the likelihood of recurrent melanoma. People who have been treated for advanced melanoma are particularly encouraged to call their doctor to arrange a check-up or scan if they are worried about anything related to their health. The likelihood of melanoma returning increases the more advanced a person’s melanoma is when they begin treatment. Treatment for melanoma may include any, or a combination, of the following approaches:\n\nThis type of surgery can usually be performed under local anesthetic as an outpatient procedure. It involves cutting away the mole or area of skin affected by melanoma in its entirety, as well as a band of healthy skin around the edge of the affected area. The size of skin removed depends on the thickness of the melanoma, and where the affected area of the body is.\n\nIn some cases, a skin graft, i.e. healthy skin taken from another area of the body, will be used to cover the skin removed during wide excision surgery.\n\nIf melanoma is found in the lymph nodes; i.e. a sentinel lymph node biopsy is carried out and the results are positive; this kind of surgery will remove the lymph nodes to which melanoma has spread. Usually carried out under general anesthetic, lymph node dissection involves making an incision in the area where the infected lymph nodes are, e.g. the armpit or groin. Careful monitoring during recovery is needed to prevent complications such as lymphedema; the buildup of undrained lymph in the area where the nodes were removed. 21\n\nAs an adjuvant (additional) treatment to lymph node dissection, some doctors will recommend an immunotherapy treatment called interferon alpha (IFN-α), targeting the area where the melanoma had infected the lymph nodes. 22 Adjuvant treatments are therapies prescribed in addition to the primary procedures, aimed to help lower the chances of recurrent melanoma. Periodical check-ups will be scheduled after surgery in order to ensure that the affected person is recovering properly, to prevent complications and to screen for recurrent melanoma (melanoma that returns) and new melanomas. These follow-up appointments will usually be scheduled to take place every two to three months, and annually after five years have passed.\n\nIf melanoma has advanced to another area of the body, for example, an organ or another area of skin, this is called secondary melanoma. It may be possible to remove the secondary melanoma via a surgical operation, depending on where in the body it is. A person’s medical care team will assess criteria such as how likely the surgery is to be successful, and whether the affected person is otherwise fit and healthy enough to undergo the necessary procedure, before recommending this approach. Surgery is most likely to be carried out when melanoma is believed to have spread to only one other site in the body, rather than multiple areas. 23\n\nAlso known as radiotherapy, radiation therapy kills cancer cells using high-energy waves. This treatment is usually carried out to treat melanoma which has spread. It is not usually used at the primary site, except in cases where surgical removal of the melanoma is considered unsuitable for the affected person. 24 When it is recommended, radiation therapy is most often used to treat the following types of secondary melanoma: 25 Melanoma in the skin Ocular melanoma Mucosal melanoma Radiation therapy can also be recommended as a preventative measure after surgical removal of melanoma, to help reduce the risk of recurrence.\n\nThis is a fairly new treatment for melanoma, which is an innovation on standard chemotherapy medications. These approaches are usually used to treat melanoma which has spread, and/or in cases where surgery is not feasible, or has been unsuccessful. Targeted therapy is considered to be more effective for treating melanoma than chemotherapy, which kills all quickly dividing cells. Like chemotherapy, targeted therapy is systemic. The medication is infused into the bloodstream intravenously, and travels throughout the entire body. 26 However, unlike chemotherapy, targeted therapy is designed to target only the parts of cancerous cells that make them different from normal cells, shutting them down. 27 Due to this difference, targeted therapy also has less severe side-effects.\n\nChemotherapy will usually only be offered in order to treat advanced melanoma which has not responded well to other treatments. Newer types of biologic treatment, such as targeted therapy, will usually be recommended first. Chemotherapy is systemic, meaning that it circulates throughout the body via the bloodstream, and the side-effects can be severe, including nausea, hair loss, fatigue, and a compromised immune system which results in increased susceptibility to infections. For more information, see this resource on chemotherapy side-effects . Good to know: It is possible to undergo regional chemotherapy, in which the chemotherapy drug used is confined to a limb, rather than circulating throughout the rest of the body. This generally minimizes the side effects of the chemotherapy. Regional chemotherapy can be carried out if the the recurring melanoma develops in an arm or leg, very close to the primary melanoma. 28\n\nResearch is continually being carried out in order to develop new treatment methods that may be more effective than current ones at treating melanoma that has spread significantly. People with stage III or IV melanoma may wish to take part in a clinical trial in order to access the latest treatment innovations. More information about clinical trials can be found in this resource from the American Cancer Society .",
    "prevention": "Being sunburnt intensely or regularly, even at a young age, is a risk factor for developing melanoma in adulthood. For this reason, it is important that all people, even newborn babies, are protected against sun damage. Actions that can help reduce a person’s risk of melanoma include: 29 30 Covering up the skin with protective clothing when spending time in the sunlight, including wide-brimmed hats, t-shirts and UV-protective sunglasses Always wearing a sunscreen with broad spectrum protection , against UVA and UVB rays of sun protection factor (SPF) 30, or above Using a water-resistant sunscreen when swimming or during high-intensity activities, such as sports Avoiding tanning, especially UV tanning beds Seeking shade, especially between 10AM and 4PM Taking extra care to wear adequate sunscreen in reflective environments; sea, snow and sand all magnify the effects of harmful UVB radiation Being aware that certain medications can leave a person more vulnerable to sun damage; always check the guidelines of any new medications and consult a doctor about the risks of sun exposure Examining the skin once a month for signs of melanoma Consulting a doctor yearly for a professional skin examination",
    "melanoma_faqs": "Q: Can melanoma return after successful treatment? A: The sooner melanoma is diagnosed in its development, the less it will have spread before treatment begins and the smaller the risk that it will return. For example, Stage 0-I melanomas are most often fully treatable and unlikely to return, whereas the likelihood of Stage IV melanoma returning is greater. When melanoma returns, this is called recurrent melanoma. There are two situations in which a person may experience recurrent melanoma: Due to initial treatment for melanoma having been inconclusive , i.e. some cancerous cells have remained in their body. Following successful treatment of the initial melanoma, a person can develop new, local outbreaks of melanoma. People who have a medical history of melanoma and/or other types of cancer are more likely to develop recurrent melanoma than those who do not. A person’s treatment plan for recurrent melanoma will usually involve one or more of the treatment options for initial melanoma, and will depend on where in the body the melanoma has spread to, and how far it has advanced. Q: What happens if a person develops melanoma during pregnancy? A: According to the American Academy of Dermatology, melanoma can in some cases be safely treated during pregnancy . If melanoma is diagnosed in the early stages, it can be removed using local anesthetic, which does not pose health risks to the developing baby. The sooner melanoma is diagnosed, the easier it will be to treat the expectant mother without posing risks to the baby. This is because most of the treatment methods that are used to treat advanced melanomas are not recommended for pregnant people. For example, radiation therapy is only recommended for treating the head and neck of pregnant women; if it is applied to the pelvic area, there is a risk of birth defects. Always consult a doctor if melanoma is suspected, to help ensure that it can be detected and treated promptly. 25 Q: Can a baby be born with melanoma, if the mother is affected during pregnancy? A: It is very rare , but possible, for a baby to be born with melanoma. It is an unlikely outcome even if a mother has stage IV melanoma during pregnancy, but it is possible because melanoma can cross the placenta; the organ which transmits nutrients and carries waste away from the fetus in the womb. If a pregnant person is being treated for melanoma, the placenta should be examined after birth. if melanoma is detected, the baby should receive regular check-ups from a dermatologist. 31"

    "overview": "Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation, confirmed after 12 consecutive months without a period. Menopause can happen as a natural part of aging or due to medical interventions. Menopause symptoms can have a severe impact in some cases. Menopause treatments exist to relieve symptoms and to decrease the risk of complications.\n\nMenopause happens to all women at some point in their life. For most, it’s a part of natural aging, although it can also happen after certain medical interventions. Menopause usually happens gradually, and the symptoms can differ from person to person. With treatment for menopause, you can reduce the symptoms you’re experiencing. In this guide by Ada’s medical team, you’ll find more information on menopause, its symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.",
    "what_is_menopause": "Menopause is the stage that marks the end of your reproductive years. If you are in menopause, then you haven’t gotten your period for a consecutive period of 12 months . Menopause occurs after the reproductive years due to hormonal changes caused by aging. The transition into menopause usually happens gradually and often begins with changes in the menstrual cycle before other symptoms start showing up. 1 2",
    "at_what_age_does_menopause_start": "Menopause is a process that is different for each woman, so there’s no fixed age at which it starts for everyone . Normally, the transition starts between the ages of 35 and 55. The first phase of menopause, called perimenopause usually starts in your late 40s, after which the average age of menopause itself is about 51 to 52. 3 1",
    "what_are_the_stages": "Menopause is a process that usually happens gradually. It can be divided into 3 different stages: Perimenopause : this is the stage before menopause where your hormone levels begin to drop, and you may notice the first signs of menopause. It can last for several months or, in some cases, even up to 10 years. While it's less likely to become pregnant during this time, there's still a possibility. Menopause : actual menopause is defined as having missed your period for 12 consecutive months. Postmenopause begins once a year has passed since your last menstrual cycle. In this stage, you can still experience some of the same symptoms you’ve experienced during the other stages. Besides these stages, some women can also experience early menopause . This is menopause at an early age, which is usually not the result of aging. 3",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Menopause symptoms are caused by the hormonal changes in your body, and can be noticed both physically and mentally. Some common signs of menopause are: 2 1 Hot flushes : a feeling of sudden heat in the face, neck or chest Night sweats Palpitations Changes in menstruation Vaginal dryness Painful intercourse Reduced sex drive Painful joints and muscles Changes to your body composition Having dry and itchy skin Recurrent urinary tract infections Incontinence Difficulty sleeping Headaches Changes in mood Memory problems Depression The symptoms of menopause can vary in nature and intensity , making the transition into menopause something very personal. Some women almost do not experience any menopause signs, while others may experience severe symptoms that affect their quality of life. The symptoms can last for several years in some cases.",
    "what_causes_menopause": "Menopause happens when women grow older, as the ovaries start to lose their function and stop releasing eggs that can be fertilized . This causes changes to your hormones, which can cause irregular menstrual cycles and eventually a complete stop of your menstruation. Apart from natural menopause, you can also stop having your period earlier than expected. This is referred to as early menopause , characterized by its onset usually before age 45. Menopause that results from medical or surgical intervention is typically called ' induced menopause .’ Some causes of early or induced menopause include: 4 A hysterectomy , which means that the uterus is removed An oophorectomy , which means that the ovaries are removed Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) , which means that the ovaries do not function properly. This can result from genetics, surgery, or cancer treatments like radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Autoimmune disorders and toxins can also contribute to POI.",
    "how_can_menopause_be_diagnosed": "The diagnosis of menopause can be made based on your age and the symptoms you’re experiencing . Menopause tests aren’t required to diagnose menopause. However, blood and urine samples can help determine your levels of estradiol , follicle-stimulating hormone , and luteinizing hormone , which typically have different values during menopause. Menopause is medically diagnosed after you have gone 12 consecutive months without a period. 5",
    "what_are_common_menopause_treatments": "Menopause treatment is focused on symptom relief and the prevention of complications. Systemic hormonal treatment can help reduce the severity and frequency of the symptoms of menopause. It can also help reduce the risk of complications such as osteoporosis . This therapy can be administered in various forms such as tablets, sprays, gels, patches, or vaginal rings. Which hormones you need depends on your personal situation. Hormonal treatment should only be given for a limited amount of time, so it’s essential to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider. 4 Local estrogen therapy can help with urogenital symptoms such as recurrent urinary tract infections, vaginal dryness, and pain during intercourse. It can be used in addition to systemic hormonal treatment. 4 Nonhormonal treatment exists for the treatment of physical symptoms such as hot flashes. Some examples are: 4 Paroxetine Escitalopram Gabapentin Neurokinin B During menopause, vitamin supplements may help relieve your symptoms. Studies show that the best menopause supplements are: 4 Vitamin E Omega-3 Milk thistle Menopause self-care can consist of making lifestyle changes such as: 4 Maintaining a healthy weight Cognitive behavioral therapy Wearing breathable clothing Doing exercise",

Some women may experience menopause earlier, while others may enter it at a later age. Q: What is the biggest symptom of menopause? A: The main symptom of menopause is a change in your menstruation. Menopause can cause a lot of other symptoms, such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and mood changes. Q: What are the effects of menopause? A: Due to the changes in your hormones during menopause, you can get osteoporosis, osteopenia, and an increased risk of heart disease and prolapse of the pelvic organs. Q: What are the 3 stages of menopause? A: The transition into menopause happens gradually and can be divided into 3 stages being: perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause. Q: Is bleeding after menopause always cancer? A: There is a possibility that bleeding after menopause can indicate cancer of the inner lining of the uterus. Most bleeding after menopause is, however, an indication of atrophy or polyps. Q: Does menopause make you tired? A: Yes, fatigue can be a symptom of menopause, but not every woman experiences fatigue during her menopause. There are also various other possible causes for feeling tired."

    "what_are_menstrual_disorders": "During the menstrual period, the inner lining of the uterus detaches and is then expelled through the vagina as menstrual blood. Most people experience mild symptoms such as cramps caused by contractions of the uterus while some feel none at all aside from the bleeding itself. These symptoms are due to natural changes in hormone levels and are usually manageable with little impact on day-to-day life. They usually occur up to a week before the period starts and can continue for the first 2-3 days when bleeding is heavier. Menstrual disorders occur when symptoms are more intense and have a negative impact on daily life . Painful menstruation and other physical symptoms during periods are called dysmenorrhea while physical symptoms accompanied by emotional changes before the period starts are known as premenstrual syndrome or PMS . When PMS symptoms are very severe and have a deep impact on the person’s social and professional life, this is classified as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. If you think you might suffer from menstrual disorders, try using the free Ada App to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "causes": "Dysmenorrhea is classified as primary when there is no specific cause and as secondary when an underlying condition leads to painful periods.With primary dysmenorrhea, the prostaglandin chemicals which cause the uterus to contract are overproduced by the body. This leads the uterus to contract too much causing intense pain. 1 2 3 4\n\nAs well as an overproduction of prostaglandins, secondary dysmenorrhea is usually caused by an underlying condition: Endometriosis : when the uterine lining tissue grows outside the uterus on the surface of other organs like the bladder, intestines, or ovaries. This tissue responds to hormonal stimulation during the menstrual cycle but cannot be expelled as period blood during the bleeding phase of the cycle. This causes affected organs to stick together as well as scarring which can in turn cause complications such as chronic pain and infertility. Adenomyosis : similar to endometriosis but instead of tissue growing on other organs, it grows in the muscular part of the uterus, making it bigger and sometimes causing pain. Uterine fibroids : non-cancerous tumors that can grow in different layers of the uterus. These tumors increase the size of the uterus and may cause pain, abnormal bleeding, and add pressure on other organs. 1 2 3 4\n\nThe causes of PMS are still not very clear but are certainly related to a drop in levels of the hormone estrogen just before the period starts. Physical symptoms like cramps, nausea, breast pain, swelling and headaches can occur as well as emotional symptoms like mood swings, crying, depression and insomnia. 1 2 3 4",
    "dysmenorrhea_symptoms": "The symptoms between primary vs. secondary dysmenorrhea are not the same. Primary dysmenorrhea’s main symptom is pelvic pain usually in the form of cramps and may be accompanied by: 1 3 Headaches Diarrhea Nausea Vomiting Dizziness Leg and back pain Symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea usually start during or just before menstruation. They can last up to 2-3 days during the period, varying from woman to woman. Usually, they are worse on the days that the flow is more intense. Younger girls are more likely to have primary dysmenorrhea with the condition naturally getting better the older they get. Periods tend to be less painful and primary dysmenorrhea can even disappear after childbirth. Secondary dysmenorrhea tends to start later in life and lasts longer during periods. As well as common dysmenorrhea symptoms others may be present: Pain during penetrative sex Heavy menstrual bleeding Difficulties getting pregnant Abnormal uterine bleeding Painful periods that don't get better with treatment",
    "premenstrual_syndrome_symptoms": "Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome usually start around a week before the period and tend to get better once it starts. Symptoms can vary from month to month but are normally present to some degree every cycle. Symptoms can be emotional or physical or both. 2 4 5\n\nDepression Mood changes Sudden crying Anxiety Irritability Sadness Difficulties sleeping Decreased sex drive Tiredness with needs to take naps during the day Social withdrawal\n\nAppetite changes Fatigue Headaches Acne Abdominal pain Constipation or diarrhea Breast tenderness Bloating Swelling of feet, legs and hands Weight gain Do these symptoms sound familiar? Try Ada to find out more.",
    "diagnoses": "To diagnose dysmenorrhea, a medical professional will assess symptoms and do a physical exam. Imaging tests such as an ultrasound or an MRI may be used to differentiate primary from secondary dysmenorrhea. These exams help the medical professional to look at the pelvic organs and exclude the presence of underlying causes like uterine fibroids. In some cases, minor keyhole surgery like a laparoscopy might be necessary. This allows the doctor to have a good view of the internal organs and diagnose any problems that might be causing pain like endometriosis. 1 2 3 4 5\n\nWith premenstrual syndrome, diagnosis is done by tracking and analyzing symptoms with the help of a medical professional. Symptoms should be recorded every day for at least 3 months in a row. This should include how the person feels and rating of how severe the symptoms are. Periods should also be recorded so that the onset of symptoms can be compared with phases in the menstrual cycle. PMS is diagnosed when a doctor confirms a pattern recurring over at least 3 consecutive months. PMS symptoms first appear at least 5-7 days before the period and end max 4 days after the period starts. Very intense recurring symptoms of PMS might be PMDD or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. 1 2 3 4 5",
    "dysmenorrhea_treatment": "Menstrual pain can be easily and effectively treated at home. Hot water bottles and warm baths : applying warm compresses to the belly or taking a hot shower can help. Heat relaxes the contracting uterine muscles. Light exercise : stretching and gentle yoga positions like child’s pose or cat-cow apply light pressure to the womb which soothes pain. Aerobic activities like a walk or a bike ride produce endorphins which block pain. Sleep and relaxation : sleep and relaxation help prevent pain and are a good coping method. 1 3 6\n\nNSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or naproxen which target chemicals that cause pain. It’s best to be cautious when taking any NSAIDs due to potential side effects. Buscopan stops muscles contracting and is very effective for treating period cramps. Estrogen and progestin birth control methods or any method that contains hormones, like the pill, injections, vaginal ring, implants, patches, or hormonal IUD help to treat pain. This option should be evaluated and prescribed by a gynecologist. Cannabis-based products like CBD have been proven effective in treating many gynecological conditions, including primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. For secondary dysmenorrhea, the specific cause needs to be addressed. For endometriosis , common hormonal methods like birth control pills, hormonal IUDs and other progestin pills suppress menstruation. This helps with symptoms and the rate of progression. In severe cases, other medications called GnRH antagonists stop the menstrual cycle completely but can also cause intense side effects. Sometimes laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgery, might be needed for effective treatment of the condition. If the cause of the pain is uterine fibroids , medication like hormonal birth control, NSAIDs and GnRH may be enough to treat them. However, sometimes the only effective treatment is fibroid removal surgery. Adenomyosis can also be managed with medications but surgery can be an option in cases where medication is ineffective. In extreme cases where all of the above options fail to help, the uterus may be removed in a procedure known as a hysterectomy.",
    "premenstrual_syndrome_treatment": "Coping with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome can be very difficult. Some simple lifestyle changes can make mild to moderate symptoms easier to cope with and improve quality of life. Severe symptoms that interfere with enjoyment of daily life should be assessed by a medical professional. Regular exercise improves quality of life by producing chemicals like endorphins that help reduce depression and mood swings. It also helps with abdominal bloating, swelling in legs and feet and improves the quality of sleep. Introducing a healthier diet by eating less sugar, fat, and salt can help with cravings, bloating and weight gain during PMS. Eating fiber-rich fruit and veg helps intestinal discomfort like constipation and diarrhea while reducing alcohol and caffeine can be a good way to prevent headaches and mood swings. Drinking plenty of water is always a good idea and helps with PMS too. Meditation and relaxation are very important measures to control anxiety and depression. This helps people cope with emotional symptoms, improves social and professional performance, and contributes to better sleep. PMS and PMDD have a big emotional effect so talking about it with a psychologist or psychotherapist can help people manage their symptoms. 2 4 5\n\nNSAIDs can be used to relieve cramps and headaches. Diuretics can help with swelling and bloating by helping the kidneys get rid of retained fluids. Controlled doses of hormones (like the birth control pill) prevent ovulation and naturally-occurring hormonal changes. As a result, people can avoid hormonal drops that trigger symptoms.In more intense cases, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs can be very helpful. Antidepressants can be used continuously or for 2 weeks before symptoms start whereas anti-anxiety medication can be used only when needed. There are many medication options in these cases which should all be discussed with a medical doctor. 2 4 5",
    "prevention": "Lifestyle changes like eating well, exercising, reducing stress, meditating, and consuming less alcohol can be very helpful in preventing both dysmenorrhea and PMS symptoms. Unfortunately, as yet there is no efficient, scientifically-proven method for avoiding most causes of secondary dysmenorrhea like fibroids, adenomyosis, or endometriosis. However, using hormonal methods and NSAIDs can reduce the impact of symptoms. Dietary supplements like calcium, magnesium , and vitamin E and vitamin D might help prevent menstrual disorder symptoms. Taking ibuprofen 2-3 days before the period starts can also reduce the chances of having extremely painful cramps. Hormonal birth control methods can also prevent painful periods and other PMS symptoms. 1 2 3 7",
    "prognosis": "The prognosis differs from the type of menstrual disorder. 1 2 3 4\n\nThe prognosis in these cases is good. There are no severe complications associated with this condition and symptoms tend to reduce naturally with age.\n\nThe prognosis depends a lot on the cause and the grade of progression of each situation. Cases that don't require surgery and respond well to medications tend to have a good prognosis. Other more severe cases can have a negative impact on the person's life and might require surgery.\n\nMild and moderate cases tend to respond well to simple life changes and medication. Some more severe cases that have a greater impact on a person's life can be more difficult to manage but most of the time have a good prognosis."

    "condition": "Mesothelioma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/mesothelioma/",
    "what_is_mesothelioma": "Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the layers of tissue that surround theinternal organs (the mesothelium). The lining of the lungs (the pleura) is the most commonlyaffected area, but the cancer can also develop in the tissue in the abdomen that surroundsthe digestive organs (the peritoneum), the lining of the heart and the tissue that surroundsthe testicles. 1 Mesothelioma typically develops slowly, manifesting itself in symptoms such as extremetiredness, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, a persistent cough, nausea, abdominalpain, swelling or weight loss. 2 The majority of mesothelioma cases are a result of exposure to asbestos, a once commonbuilding material that is now known to be highly toxic. The more exposure to asbestos, thegreater the risk of the cancer. Roughly five times more men than women are diagnosed withmesothelioma and around half of all cases occur in individuals 75 years of age or older. Itis a fairly rare type of cancer, with around 3,000 reported cases in the USA each year. 3 There is no known cure for mesothelioma and treatment can be challenging. Life expectancy,therefore, is often limited to between several months and several years after the initialdiagnosis.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of mesothelioma can be difficult to detect due to their similarity the symptomsof other, more common, conditions. Symptoms can also be very slow to develop, making thempotentially unnoticeable in the condition’s early stages. In some cases, they can takedecades to fully develop. Symptoms can also differ according to the cancer’s location. Pleural mesothelioma in the tissue lining of the lungs has symptoms that include: Shortness of breath Lower back or chest pain Fatigue A persistent cough (especially if coughing up blood) Difficulty swallowing Fever or sweating (particularly at night) Sudden weight loss or lack of appetite Peritoneal mesothelioma in the abdomen tissue that surrounds the digestive organs has symptoms that include: Abdominal swelling and pain Breathing difficulties Nausea Sudden weight loss or lack of appetite Constipation or improper bowel function Fever or sweating (particularly at night) Pericardial mesothelioma, a rare form of the condition that develops in the lining of theheart, has symptoms that include: Heart palpitations, heart murmurs or an irregular heartbeat Difficulty breathing Chest pain Coughing Fever and night sweats",
    "causes": "Although there are rare instances where no link can be found, the vast majority of all casesof mesothelioma — some 80 percent — are directly related to exposure to asbestos. The linkbetween asbestos and mesothelioma, therefore, is considered indisputable by healthcareprofessionals. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral which has been known of since antiquity and minedsince the early 19th century, though it was only in the latter half of the 20th century thatit became a common building material. Although researchers discovered a link between asbestosand cancer as early as the late 1940s, the extent of its dangers did not become commonknowledge until much later and it was only banned in the USA in 1989. 4 Those with a history of long-term exposure to asbestos are most at risk of being diagnosedwith mesothelioma. However, cases have also been reported of mesothelioma in individualswho were only exposed to the material for a relatively short period of time (1-3 months).\n\nStatistically, populations living close to naturally occurring asbestos deposits are at farhigher risk of developing mesothelioma than those who do not. Naturally occurring asbestosis found across the globe, including in the United States, Canada and South Africa. Fortypercent of the world’s asbestos is mined in Russia, with large amounts also mined in Chinaand Kazakhstan. When the earth is mined or construction work undertaken, the asbestos is disturbed, releasingparticles into the air and exposing large areas to the risk of inadvertent inhalation.\n\nWorking with asbestos, particularly in the construction and mining industries, has beenproven to vastly increase one’s risk of developing a number of diseases, including malignantmesothelioma. Despite asbestos now being banned, the risk of exposure still exists whendealing with buildings built before the banning order took effect. The use of masks andartificial respiratory systems has been shown to greatly reduce the risks posed.",
    "diagnosing_mesothelioma": "Due to the symptoms of mesothelioma also being common to less serious conditions, as wellas to other pleural and peritoneal malignancies, the cancer can often be difficult to diagnose. Those with a history of exposure to asbestos who display the symptoms should therefore makethis clear to their care providers and seek out a doctor specialising in mesothelioma. Full diagnosis of the cancer can take months, from first identification through initialimaging tests to confirmation through biopsies. Due to the rarity of the disease, patientsdisplaying the symptoms will first be asked to recall their full work history and anyexposure to asbestos. Prolonged exposure is grounds for clinical suspicion of mesotheliomaand will significantly hasten the diagnostic process.\n\nIf an initial chest X-ray shows signs of pleural thickening — a tell-tale sign of mesothelioma— a PET scan, CT scan, MRI, or a combination of the three will follow. These scans give doctors a detailed look inside the body, allowing them to identify the presence of anymalignant cancer. If a large amount of fluid is found in the pleural cavity, it is commonfor doctors to drain the fluid using a syringe and test it for cancerous cells. Though itdoes not completely exclude the presence of mesothelioma, if no cancerous cells are found,the chances of the disease are greatly reduced.\n\nLike all types of cancer, mesothelioma releases abnormal substances into the bloodstream.While there is no test that can definitively identify these substances and diagnosemesothelioma, various biomarker tests, or assays, are available and can be useful to thediagnostic process.\n\nThe presence of malignant mesothelioma can only be fully confirmed with a full biopsy. Todo this, a pathologist will examine a tissue sample, or in the case of suspected chest canceror abdomen cancer, this may involve a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy, respectively. Theseprocedures are types of minimally invasive surgery, wherein surgeons are able to remove atissue sample through a small incision in the abdomen or chest.",
    "mesothelioma_treatment": "There currently exists no cure for mesothelioma, however there are treatments availablethat can help prolong life expectancy and improve quality of life. These typically involvea combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, emerging orexperimental treatments may also be prescribed. 5 The direction that treatment will takeis largely determined by the maturity of the cancer, the age and general health of thepatient, as well as how far the cancer has spread (this will depend on what stage the cancerhas entered – see the prognosis section for more details on the stages of mesothelioma).\n\nIf the cancer has been detected early, surgery will involve fully removing the tumor(s) —or, depending on where the cancer is located — the mesothelial lining, lymph nodes or sectionsof the lungs or heart. However, if the cancer is more developed, this may be impossible andsurgery will typically be paired with chemotherapy or radiation therapy — a treatment routethat has proven effective in combatting malignant mesothelioma.\n\nCourses of chemotherapy have proven the most effective treatment method in combattingmesothelioma in controlled testing. Chemotherapy drugs work by halting the multiplicationof cancerous cells in the body and thereby stopping the spread of the disease and thedevelopment of tumors. 6 There are more than 100 types of chemotherapy drugs currentlyavailable on the market, with each differentially effective in treating patients in differentstages of the disease. Chemotherapy can result in significant side-effects , most commonly vomiting, stomatitis, exhaustion and diarrhea. Typically, the chemotherapy drugs are administered intravenously in cycles of several weeks followed by a short recuperation break. To lessen the side-effects and more directly target specific tumors, doctors have pioneered a method of localized chemotherapy whereby the drug is injected straight into the tumor itself. While this method has proven effective in combatting early-stage mesothelioma, it is not suitable for tackling the disease once it has spread from its original location.\n\nIf the cancer remains localized and the patient is in otherwise good health, radiationtherapy, in conjunction with surgery and sometimes chemotherapy as well, can be an effectivetreatment method. It has been shown to significantly improve a patient’s prognosis, however,it is considered a radical option that can result in serious side-effects. These can includepneumonitis; a condition that involves the inflammation of the alveoli (air sacs) in thelungs that can sometimes be fatal in itself.\n\nIf surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy prove ineffective, some patients may beeligible for emerging treatments in their clinical trial stage. These treatment options arethose that have not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and aretherefore considered experimental. One such promising treatment method is immunotherapy. This type of treatment harnesses thepower of the bodies own immune system, training it to specifically attack the cancerouscells and leave the healthy cells alone. This is done by introducing antigens (substancesthe body recognises as toxic) into the body, stimulating and improving the immune system’sresponse to their presence. When used in addition to conventional methods, immunotherapyhas seen some success in improving life expectancies. Across the world, numerous clinical trials are taking place on new drugs for treatment ofmesothelioma. These new, cutting-edge drugs promise to advance the treatment of the cancerand improve the prognosis of patients. New drugs take years to be tested and becomeavailable on the market, though patients with particularly severe cases may be eligiblefor inclusion on these clinical trials.",
    "mesothelioma_prognosis": "Mesothelioma spreads quickly and is difficult to treat, meaning the prognosis is generallypoor. Roughly 50 percent of people with mesothelioma in one location are expected to surviveuntil the first anniversary of their initial diagnosis. Life expectancy after diagnosis,however, depends on a multitude of factors, most significantly the stage at which the canceris detected and the age of the patient. People diagnosed with mesothelioma before the age of 50, and women in particular, can expecta better prognosis. Whether the cancer is pleural or peritoneal is also a factor. The prognosiscan be improved by maintaining a healthy lifestyle, seeing a mesothelioma specialist andreceiving a second opinion. 7 Long-term survival, however, is rare, with around one in every 10 people surviving for over 5 years after diagnosis. 8 Doctors generally describe the growth and spread of mesothelioma using the idea of four stages: Stage 1: The earliest stage of the cancer when it is still localized to one area ofthe body, with no spread to the lymph nodes or metastasis. If mesothelioma is detectedduring this stage the patient has the most treatment options and can expect a higher lifeexpectancy. Stage 2: The cancer is still largely localized to one side of the body, but may havespread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Aggressive treatment options may still be anoption. Stage 3: The cancer is still localized to one side of the body, but has spread further,including to the lymph nodes. Surgical treatment methods become less viable. Stage 4: The cancer has conclusively spread to areas far beyond its origin (distantmetastases). Treatment at this stage is generally limited to easing the uncomfortablesymptoms.",
    "legal_issues_related_to_mesothelioma": "Many people have sought to claim compensation for the development of mesothelioma as a resultof exposure to asbestos. Since the first in 1929, large amounts of lawsuits and class actioncases have been launched, normally against asbestos manufacturers and employers. 9 In theUSA, total claims have reached billions of dollars. Despite these precedents in the courts,as yet, the US Congress has passed no federal law on the issue.",
    "mesothelioma_faqs": "Q: What jobs increase the risk of exposure to asbestos? A: People involved with construction work, demolition, and home renovation are at high risk of occupational exposure to asbestos. Q: Where is naturally occurring asbestos found? A: Naturally occurring asbestos is found in many locations across the world. Asbestos deposits can be found in most US states, with California, Arizona, and Virginia having some of the highest levels. People living close to asbestos deposits should take steps to minimize their exposure, such as keeping windows and doors closed during strong wind and thoroughly wiping shoes before going indoors. Q: Can mesothelioma be benign? A: Yes. Benign mesothelioma - sometimes called multicystic or fibrous mesothelioma -refers to non-cancerous tumors within the pleura. 10 Like malignant mesothelioma, benign mesothelioma also largely results from exposure to airborne asbestos. However, unlike the cancerous version, it is relatively easy to treat with surgery to remove the tumor(s). Benign mesothelioma accounts for a tiny percentage of all mesothelioma cases, making it very rare. Q: Can mesothelioma be caused by smoking? A: No. Smoking does not increase the chances of developing mesothelioma. However, exposure to asbestos, like smoking, can also increase the risk of lung cancer 11 . Q: Is mesothelioma hereditary? A: No. Unlike most other types of cancer, the only known cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos. 12"

    "condition": "Middle Ear Infection",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/middle-ear-infection/",
    "what_is_a_middle_ear_infection": "A middle ear infection , otherwise known as otitis media , is a viral or bacterial infection of the air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. In most cases, a middle ear infection affects just one ear, but can also occur in both ears simultaneously. The infection can cause painful inflammation, as well as a build-up of fluid in the middle ear. Although people of any age can develop the infection, it is most common in younger children, with a high percentage of children experiencing the condition before the age of 10. 1 In some cases, a middle ear infection may disappear without treatment. While antibiotics are only sometimes necessary to fight the infection, pain-relievers are commonly prescribed to lessen the pain caused by the condition. Further treatment options are available for recurrent middle ear infections. Complications are rare, meaning it is generally considered a non-serious condition. There are three common types of middle ear infections: Acute otitis media: This is the most common form. It is characterized by its rapid onset and often results in ear pain, fever, and hearing impairment. It usually lasts for between a few days and a few weeks. Otitis media with effusion: Once the initial infection has faded, non-infectious fluid or mucus may continue to build, resulting in pronounced hearing loss and a feeling of fullness in the ear. Otitis media with effusion can also result from a fluid build-up that was never infected. In such cases, antibiotics will often not work as a treatment method. This form often lasts longer than acute otitis media; running its course after around four to six weeks. Chronic otitis media: An acute middle ear infection with or without effusion that does not fully disappear or repeats frequently. This can lead to a prolonged inflammatory reaction with subsequent fluid build-up and often to a tear or perforation in the ear drum. When this happens, there will also be discharge from the middle ear. Chronic otitis media can lead to long-term hearing impairment.",
    "symptoms": "A middle ear infection generally develops very rapidly . Signs and symptoms in children may include: 2 Ear pain Generally feeling unwell (malaise) Fever Muffled hearing/partial hearing loss Fluid in the ear or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears Increased irritability, restlessness, crying and trouble feeding Nausea, vomiting and/or dizziness A child may excessively pull, tug or touch their ears Symptoms of a middle ear infection in adults may include: Ear pain Partial hearing loss/muffled hearing Fluid in the ear (that may leak out) or yellow, clear or bloody discharge from the ears It is important to consult a doctor when: Symptoms develop in a child of six months or younger A child displays symptoms for 48 hours or more and has a temperature of 39 C (102.2 F) or more Symptoms show no sign of improvement after two or three days Symptoms become worse rather than better over the first few days Discharge presents itself Symptoms are experienced by a person with an underlying health condition, such as cystic fibrosis or congenital heart disease, which could make complications more likely",
    "causes": "Middle ear infections are caused by viruses and bacteria, often resulting from other conditions (flu, common cold , allergy) that can cause blockage and swelling of the eustachian tubes that connect the throat and the middle ear. When this happens, a vacuum is created, allowing germs and fluid from the throat to enter the middle ear. A middle ear infection develops when bacteria or viruses grow in this fluid. 3 Children are more susceptible to middle ear infections than adults, partly because their eustachian tubes are narrower, so they are more easily blocked. Children also have relatively larger adenoids than adults. These are masses of tissue situated at the point where the nose bends into the throat 4 that are vulnerable to infection, swelling and inflammation – when this happens, they can block the eustachian tubes and cause a middle ear infection.",
    "diagnosing_a_middle_ear_infection": "A doctor will generally be able to diagnose a middle ear infection by considering a person's symptoms and looking for specific signs. Using an otoscope (a lighted wand-like instrument), a doctor will be able to look into the ears, throat and nose for any signs of infection. 4 While the area around the eardrum will most likely be red and swollen, this will normally only be noticeable upon examination with an otoscope. The ear itself will generally not be red or swollen. In some cases, especially when the condition is predicted to have taken the form of otitis media with effusion, a pneumatic otoscope may be used to confirm a diagnosis. This instrument pumps air into the middle ear and measures the resulting pressure changes. If little response is felt, this indicates the presence of fluid in the ear. To further confirm a middle ear infection diagnosis, a doctor may order a number of further tests, including: Tympanometry: By testing the movement of the eardrum, this test can provide an indirect measure of pressure and fluid build-up behind the eardrum Acoustic reflectometry: By emitting sound into the eardrum and measuring the response from the eardrum, the amount of fluid in the eardrum can be measured. The more sound is reflected by the eardrum, the more fluid is present in the middle ear Tympanocentesis: If a middle ear infection is persistent, this test can be used to determine what kind of bacteria is present. This is done by piercing the eardrum, draining the fluid and then testing the make-up of this fluid",
    "middle_ear_infection_treatment": "In many cases, no treatment is required for a middle ear infection, with the symptoms fading quickly and the infection clearing up completely in anywhere between a number of days and two weeks. However, if the symptoms are severe or the infection is persistent, treatment methods are available.\n\nOver-the-counter pain relief medication such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) can be used by those experiencing a middle ear infection. When giving these drugs to children, a medical professional should be consulted first. Adults should read the instructions on the packaging closely before taking medicinal pain relief. For less severe pain, or if pharmaceuticals are not an option, a warm compress over the ear can also help relieve pain. 3\n\nIn children, antibiotics will normally be prescribed when: The infection is severe The child is younger than two years old, has an infection in both ears and has mild to severe pain and fever The child is at risk of complications from the infection In cases outside of these parameters, doctors will generally wait a few days before prescribing antibiotics. Adults will typically be prescribed antibiotics when the symptoms are severe or when the infection does not disappear naturally. When taking antibiotics, it is extremely important to follow the exact instructions of the doctor or pharmacist and ensure the full course is taken. Failure to do so can result in a recurrence of the problem and in the development of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria causing the infection.\n\nIf an individual experiences persistent middle ear infections (generally defined as three episodes in six months or four in a year) then ear tubes – sometimes known as grommets – may be necessary. To place these, a small hole is created in the eardrum. Through this, fluid is drained and a tube is fitted to ventilate the middle ear and prevent the further buildup of fluids. Some ear tubes will naturally fall out after a number of months, whereas others are designed to be worn for longer and may require a procedure in order to remove them. Both the initial insertion and the removal are relatively straightforward outpatient procedures.",
    "preventing_a_middle_ear_infection": "There are several ways to help children avoid a middle ear infection. They include: Breastfeeding rather than bottle feeding Avoiding a child’s exposure to tobacco smoke Ensuring a child is up-to-date with their routine vaccinations – particularly the pneumococcal vaccine and the DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1) vaccine Avoiding situations where exposure to bacterial infection is a risk (group child care, for example) Avoiding use of a pacifier",
    "complications_associated_with_a_middle_ear_infection": "Complications from middle ear infections are extremely uncommon, but can occur, especially in very young children with a not yet fully developed immune system. These complications include: 5 Mastoiditis: When the infection spreads into the bones of the ear. Symptoms include fever, pain, tenderness, headache and a creamy discharge from the ear. This condition is treatable, but seeking medical attention early is important. Cholesteatoma: A result of tissue build-up from recurrent instances of infection. If left untreated, the condition can cause serious damage. Treatment typically involves surgery. Labyrinthitis: A condition that occurs when an infection in the middle ear spreads to the inner ear. Symptoms include dizziness, hearing loss, vertigo and loss of balance. It is treatable. Other complications: Other possible complications include facial paralysis, meningitis and brain abscess, but these conditions are extremely rare.",
    "middle_ear_infection_faqs": "Q: Are there any home remedies for treating a middle ear infection? A: There are a variety of natural remedies for treating a middle ear infection. These treatment methods may provide some immediate relief, however, a doctor should also be consulted in cases where symptoms persist for more that a couple of days. Remedies include: 6 Salt: Heat salt in a pan, wrap it in a cloth and place the cloth against the affected ear for up to ten minutes. This should help draw out fluid from the ear and provide some relief Garlic or onions: The antimicrobial properties of garlic and onions give them natural pain relieving qualities. Garlic can be eaten raw. Alternatively, it can be boiled and crushed, then wrapped in a cloth and placed against the ear. It can also be cooked in sesame or mustard oil until black, strained and applied to the ears in drops Olive oil: Slightly heat the olive oil and apply a few drop to the ears Warm compress: Heat a cloth to a bearable level and place against the outer ear Q: Are middle ear infections contagious? A: Middle ear infections are not contagious or spreading. However, part of their causes, like viral infections (such as the common cold) are contagious and spread from person to person. 7"

They’re most commonly experienced as headaches on one side of the head and may be accompanied by various symptoms depending on the type of migraine. This guide provides a practical outline of the different types of migraines, their symptoms, risk factors, and treatment options.",
    "what_is_a_migraine": "A migraine is a type of headache that results in a pulsating or throbbing pain , usually on one side of the head . This headache is often quite intense and may be accompanied by other symptoms. Untreated attacks last anywhere between 4 and 72 hours. According to the American Migraine Foundation, migraines affect about 12% of people in the US. While the exact cause of migraines isn’t fully understood, we know that they result from inflammation near the nerves and blood vessels of the head . Most people experience migraines for the first time during puberty and are often affected by the condition for their entire lives, as migraine attacks are often recurring . Luckily, there are migraine treatments that can decrease the impact of this condition on everyday activities. Women are more commonly affected by this condition due to the effects of the hormonal cycle on migraines. 2 3 4",
    "what_are_the_types": "Different migraine types exist , each with its possible symptoms and characteristics. Variants of migraine headaches include: Migraine with aura (classic migraine) Migraine without aura (common migraine) Migraine with brainstem aura Chronic migraine Migraine in children (abdominal migraine) Menstrual migraine Retinal migraine Hemiplegic migraine Vestibular migraine Silent migraine Status migrainosus",
    "symptoms": "Migraine symptoms can range from mild headaches to severe effects. What you may experience depends on the stage and type of migraine you have.\n\nMigraines can have up to 4 stages, though only some people experience all of them. Here’s a quick look at each stage: 1. Prodrome stage (up to 24 hours before the migraine) may involve frequent yawning, mood changes, or cravings for certain foods. 2. Aura stage can include visual disturbances like flashing or bright lights. 3. Headache stage . 4. Postdrome stage (after the headache) often includes general tiredness that can last about a day.\n\nTypes of migraine and their symptoms:\n\nThe most common symptoms of a common migraine include: 2 Throbbing, pulsating pain on one side of the head. This pain may affect the eye area but can occur anywhere in the head or the neck. Sensitivity to light, sound, and/or smell Vision changes Nausea Vomiting Besides these common symptoms of a migraine, it’s also possible to experience: Loss of appetite Muscle tenderness Impaired concentration Fatigue Anxiety Other symptoms\n\nBetween 10% and 30% of people affected by migraine headaches experience additional accompanying neurological disturbances called an aura . This often results in a temporary loss of vision or visual disturbances, such as flashing lights. The aura often occurs right before the headache attack begins but may also occur during the attack, afterward, or on its own. The typical migraine aura is characterized by visual symptoms, including: 5 Colored or blind spots in the field of eyesight Sparkles, stars, or flashing lights An arc or band of absent vision, often with a shimmering border or zigzag lines Tunnel vision Temporary blindness\n\nPeople with chronic migraine symptoms experience : migraine headaches for more than 15 days per month additional symptoms of migraine for at least 8 days per month . Common chronic migraine symptoms include: 6 Frequent headaches High sensitivity to light, sound, or smells Nausea Vomiting Migraine aura Dizziness or vertigo\n\nAbdominal migraine usually occurs in children, although adults can also suffer from this condition. Some of the typical symptoms of this sort of migraine are: 7 A dull pain or soreness around the belly button Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Light and noise sensitivity Headaches (less frequent)\n\nMenstrual migraines cause the same symptoms as a regular migraine. However, the attacks are typically more severe than migraines at other times of the month . Common menstrual migraine symptoms include: 8 Throbbing or pulsating headache on one side of the head Sensitivity to light Sensitivity to sound Vision changes Nausea Vomiting\n\nPeople who experience a silent migraine experience the symptoms of a migraine aura but without the headache. The symptoms of a migraine aura include: 9 Vision difficulties, such as seeing zigzag lines or flashing lights Numbness or the feeling of pins and needles Feeling dizzy Difficulty speaking\n\nThe symptoms of status migrainosus can be very severe , with intense pain that can even lead to hospitalization. You can experience: 2 Severe headache for over 72 hours Severe nausea Migraine aura symptoms\n\nThere are other types of migraine that can cause vertigo, temporary paralysis, visual loss, and ringing in the ears and are linked to the part of the head most affected. Some of the combinations of symptoms might also be present in more serious emergency conditions. If you haven’t been diagnosed with migraines and experience acute brain or vision symptoms, seek medical advice urgently. This helps rule out any serious conditions that may need investigation.",
    "migraine_risk_factors": "There are some factors that increase the chances of being susceptible to migraines , such as having a member of the family affected. Women are 3 times more likely to develop migraines than men, mainly due to hormonal changes at puberty, pregnancy , and menopause . Migraines can be triggered by various factors, which can differ from person to person. Common triggers include: 2 Environmental: Loud noises, bright or flashing lights, strong smells, extreme temperatures, and poorly ventilated spaces. Physical: Fatigue, poor posture, smoking, lack of sleep, sudden and strenuous exercise, head and neck tension, motion sickness, and low blood sugar. Dietary: Caffeine, alcohol, dehydration, irregular meal times, certain food additives, like aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG), chocolate, aged cheeses, salty foods, citrus fruits, and even skipping meals. Emotional: Stress, anxiety, and low mood. Hormonal: Menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Medications: Particularly the combined contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, and sleeping tablets. It’s important to check with a doctor or consult the medication packet to understand if they could be associated with headaches.",
    "migraine_diagnosis": "A healthcare provider can diagnose a migraine by: 11 Checking symptoms along with medical, family, and overall health history . Looking at headache details to find triggers and see how attacks affect daily life. Using CT or MRI scans to rule out other causes of headaches by examining the brain. Performing a complete neurologic exam to check nerve function. Since migraines don’t cause lasting nerve damage, any nerve issues might suggest another problem. This exam usually includes tests of motor and sensory nerves, cranial nerves, reflexes, coordination, gait, and signs of irritation in the brain’s protective layers. A migraine diagnosis is given when other causes are ruled out. After diagnosing a migraine, a healthcare provider can recommend treatments to help reduce the impact on daily life.",
    "migraine_treatment": "There is a range of treatments for migraines. They can be broken down into those that help relieve attacks and those that help prevent them.\n\nA variety of treatments and medications, which are suitable for adults and children, are available to reduce the acute symptoms during a migraine attack. These include: 12\n\nNSAIDs such as ibuprofen and aspirin can help reduce headache pain . Their anti-inflammatory properties are thought to help relieve the migraine’s characteristic throbbing/pulsing sensation. Depending on the type and strength, they can be purchased over the counter or prescribed. However, NSAIDs are not suitable for long-term use, as they can cause complications, including gastrointestinal disorders. People who experience frequent migraine attacks and need regular pain relief should consult their doctor to explore the most appropriate treatment options.\n\nTriptan medications should be taken at the first sign of a migraine starting . They work on the blood vessels and pain pathways that are associated with migraines. Your doctor might prescribe these if other medications haven't helped.\n\nErgotamine is derived from a fungus called ergot, and these medications can be used to provide instant migraine relief . Using ergotamine too frequently can, however, result in the development of chronic, persistent headaches.\n\nOpioid medications are more rarely prescribed and usually reserved as a short-term treatment where the above ones have not helped and are not recommended for long-term use.\n\nPreventing migraines relies on a combination of lifestyle changes and medications. Behavioral changes that are recommended for preventing migraine attacks include: 2 Developing techniques to manage and reduce stress , such as deep breathing exercises and regular physical activity Keeping a diary to identify migraine triggers , such as exposure to strong smells, which can then be avoided if possible Sleeping well, and establishing a consistent sleep cycle Staying hydrated , by drinking water and other non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated beverages throughout the day Establishing regular meal times, and adopting a healthy, balanced diet Devising a new medication plan with the healthcare provider if any medications that a person takes regularly are thought to be causing the headaches Following a safe weight-loss program is recommended, for obese people affected by migraine headaches Where people have frequent attacks, medication may be prescribed to prevent migraine headaches. The medications that have been found most effective at migraine prevention include : 2 Anticonvulsant medications (commonly used for epilepsy) A couple of blood pressure medications: Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers. Antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) injections are approved by the FDA as a treatment for chronic migraine Finding the right preventative and relieving treatment, as well as the best lifestyle changes, can have a positive impact on reducing the frequency and severity of attacks and their negative effects on life, work, and sleep. Talk to your doctor about what options might be best suited to you.",

    "what_is_a_miscarriage": "A miscarriage is a fairly common complication of early pregnancy, in which the developing embryo or fetus dies in the womb, of natural causes or due to exposure to substances, i.e. in certain medications, which are unsuitable for use during pregnancy. The term miscarriage is used to describe this process when it happens during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. A miscarriage which occurs in the first trimester (weeks 1-12 of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage. A miscarriage which occurs in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of the pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage. Loss of the fetus which occurs after week 20 of pregnancy is known as a stillbirth. The symptoms of a miscarriage include vaginal bleeding, cramping and abdominal pain, but it is also possible to experience a miscarriage without symptoms being present, and many miscarriages are diagnosed during a routine ultrasound scan. Many people experience intense emotional distress after having a miscarriage, particularly if it occurs during a planned pregnancy. Nearly 20 percent of women, who experience a miscarriage, develop symptoms of depression and anxiety, for which a range of therapeutic treatment options are available. For most people, distress associated with a miscarriage begins to lessen around four months after the miscarriage. 2",
    "symptoms": "The potential symptoms of a miscarriage are broadly the same, whether it occurs in the first trimester (early miscarriage) or second trimester (late miscarriage). It is also possible to have a miscarriage without experiencing any symptoms, and some miscarriages are only detected during a routine scan. When present, the most common symptoms of a miscarriage are: Abdominal pain Vaginal bleeding Discharge of fluid or tissue from the vagina Cramping No longer experiencing the symptoms of pregnancy , such as nausea and breast tenderness A person who is miscarrying may experience one or more of the possible symptoms, but their presence does not always indicate that a miscarriage is taking place: it is also possible to experience any of these symptoms as part of a healthy pregnancy, or due to a problem other than miscarriage. Other explanations for the presence of symptoms of miscarriage include: Implantation bleeding. This occurs in some pregnancies when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. A healthy pregnancy progressing normally. Pain, cramping, vaginal bleeding and discharge are normal features of early pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding in combination with abdominal pain or cramping is more likely to be indicative of a miscarriage than the presence of any of these symptoms on their own. Ectopic pregnancy. Also known as a tube pregnancy, this occurs when the embryo attaches outside the uterus (womb). As with a miscarriage, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding are two principal symptoms of ectopic pregnancy . Molar pregnancy. This occurs when a lump of abnormal cells grows in the womb, instead of a healthy embryo. As with a miscarriage, vaginal bleeding is a principal symptom of molar pregnancy . Many people become concerned that they are having a miscarriage if any of its possible symptoms occur ‒ particularly vaginal bleeding ‒ and it is advisable to seek medical attention promptly to check if there is a problem. One can undergo an early pregnancy ultrasound scan to establish whether one is in fact experiencing a miscarriage, and to detect any other problems with the pregnancy. People experiencing symptoms that may be linked to a miscarriage can also carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app . Read more about the Signs of Miscarriage »",
    "types": "The kind of miscarriage a person has depends on: 3 At what point within the timeline of a typical pregnancy the miscarriage occurs Whether the miscarriage involves losing all or part of the pregnancy tissue, the protective sac, or lining, that forms around the developing fetus in the womb How many times a person has been affected by miscarriage The principal types of miscarriage are: Early miscarriage, i.e. in the first trimester Late miscarriage, i.e. in the second trimester Recurrent miscarriage, i.e. more than three consecutive miscarriages Chemical pregnancy, i.e. in very early pregnancy, even before ultrasounds can detect - a fetus A miscarriage can also be classified according to how much pregnancy tissue and fetal matter are lost: 4 Complete miscarriage occurs when the fetus and all related pregnancy tissue are lost. No treatment is needed, but the previously pregnant person might benefit from psychotherapy to help process the experience. Incomplete miscarriage occurs when only part of the fetal matter and pregnancy tissue exit the womb. Further medical treatment will be sometimes be needed to remove the remainder. Symptoms can be very subtle and can therefore go unnoticed. Missed miscarriage occurs when the fetus dies within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, but, in most cases, no fetal matter or tissue pass out of the womb. The physical miscarriage may have to be medically induced. Missed miscarriage is usually an incidental finding because there is rarely any indication that anything was wrong with the pregnancy. 5 To find out about the range of possible treatment options for incomplete and missed miscarriages, see Treatment .\n\nA miscarriage which takes place in the first trimester (during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) is known as an early miscarriage. This is the most common type of miscarriage and is most commonly caused by chromosomal abnormalities (problems with the foetus’s DNA) or by problems affecting the placenta.\n\nA miscarriage which takes place in the second trimester (during weeks 13-20 of pregnancy) is known as a late miscarriage. Late miscarriages are much less common than early miscarriages and are often caused by: Problems arising from uterine or cervical abnormalities Invasive fetal diagnostic procedures Rhesus isoimmunisation Long-term (chronic) health conditions affecting the pregnant person, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome The pregnant person contracting infections, which may be sexually transmitted; for example, chlamydia Food poisoning; salmonella, toxoplasmosis and listeria Read more about Foods to Avoid During Pregnancy »\n\nAbout 1 in 100 people experience recurrent miscarriages, which means having three or more miscarriages in a row. 6 People who experience recurrent miscarriages can undergo tests to see if there is an underlying cause. Because a person’s chances of miscarrying increase with age, someone over 35 years of age will usually be offered these tests after two early miscarriages. The underlying cause(s) of miscarriage will be treated where possible. However, a cause is not always found as a result of testing. Not finding a cause for recurrent miscarriage is not necessarily a negative outcome: many people who experience recurrent miscarriages for no apparent cause go on to have a healthy pregnancy when they next conceive, without needing further treatment. 7\n\nMany miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy, before a person is necessarily aware that they had become pregnant. This is called a chemical pregnancy, and occurs around week five of pregnancy – usually before pregnancy symptoms are present and always before the developing embryo would be visible on an ultrasound scan. Some people, in particular, those who are trying to conceive, are aware of their chemical pregnancy, as it can be detected at this early stage on a pregnancy test. In a chemical pregnancy, the fertilized egg fails to survive in the uterus. After the miscarriage, future pregnancy tests related to this pregnancy will be negative. It is possible for a person with a chemical pregnancy to be unaware of the pregnancy and of miscarrying, particularly if they were not trying to conceive, as symptoms like abdominal pain and/or blood loss may appear to be part of their next menstrual period. Good to know: Many forms of birth control (contraception), such as the combined pill or progesterone-only (mini) pill work to thin the lining of the womb. These medications are usually taken intentionally to prevent pregnancy. One way in which they do this is by preventing the fertilized egg from implanting in the lining of the uterus. When a fertilized egg does not implant due to the effective use of birth control, this is not considered a chemical pregnancy.",
    "causes": "Most miscarriages occur in the first trimester and are a result of chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus or problems with the placenta. Miscarriages which occur in the second trimester are more likely to be caused by pregnancy complications related to long-term health conditions, diseases or infections. 8 Age is a principal factor in the likelihood of a miscarriage, and increases the likelihood of miscarrying in both the first and the second trimester. In people under 30, only 1 in 10 pregnancies will end in miscarriage. In people over 45, more than half of all pregnancies will end in miscarriage. 9 A 2015 survey of people across the U.S. who have experienced a miscarriage found that over 75 percent of people strongly wish to know the cause of their miscarriage. 10 To help identify any possible causes for miscarriage, it is usual for doctors to perform: An autopsy on the pregnancy tissue A placental exam Common causes of first-trimester (early) miscarriages include: 11 Chromosomal abnormalities: If an embryo has more or fewer than 23 pairs of chromosomes, this is a chromosomal abnormality, and it will be vulnerable to miscarriage, either during its embryo stage or when it develops into a fetus. 12 Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of early miscarriage. They are detected in 50-85 percent of the pregnancy tissue specimens that are analyzed to determine the cause of miscarriage. Placental problems: The placenta is an organ which develops in the uterus during pregnancy to pass oxygen and nutrients to the foetus. It is pancake-shaped and should be positioned at the top of the uterus, as far away as possible from the cervix. 14 If the placenta does not form or function correctly, this is likely to negatively affect the development of the fetus, causing a miscarriage. Common causes of second-trimester (late) miscarriages include:\n\nCertain long-term health conditions including diabetes, severe hypertension, coagulation disorder, lupus, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and kidney disease can make a person more prone to miscarrying. If a long-term health condition is being poorly managed or managed in a way which is unsuitable for pregnant people, the risk of miscarriage increases further.\n\nSome medications, including ibuprofen, certain vitamins and herbal supplements, are unsuitable for pregnant people, and using them can cause miscarriage or congenital abnormalities. Always consult a doctor before using any prescription or over-the-counter medication to ensure that it is suitable for use in pregnancy.\n\nDiseases and infections commonly linked to miscarriage and pregnancy complications include chlamydia, Dengue fever, rubella , cytomegalovirus, malaria, brucellosis, influenza, vaginal infection with bacterial vaginosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Seek medical attention at the first sign of infection when pregnant and avoid activities and environments associated with increased risk. 15\n\nThe most common types of food poisoning associated with miscarriage are salmonella, toxoplasmosis and listeriosis. Avoid uncooked and unpasteurised meats and animal products, in particular when pregnant in order to minimise the risk of food poisoning, and visit a doctor if symptoms such as fever, diarrhea or vomiting occur. Antibiotics given to pregnant people for food poisoning may reduce the likelihood of miscarrying if taken promptly.\n\nSmoking tobacco and working in workplaces such as radiology departments, factories or farms are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is strongly recommended that all people, who are trying to conceive or are pregnant, adapt their lifestyle and day-to-day routine in order to avoid factors such as pollution, pesticides and radiation to minimize the risk of miscarriage.\n\nProblems with the womb or cervix structure or function can increase the likelihood of miscarrying. Many womb or cervical dysfunctions make a miscarriage particularly likely to occur in the second trimester, as the developing fetus grows in size. Other possible causes for miscarriage include: Invasive fetal diagnostic procedures Rhesus isoimmunisation Read more about the Causes of Miscarriage » .",
    "risk_factors_for_miscarriage": "The following factors may not be the sole cause of a person experiencing a miscarriage, but they are linked to a heightened risk of miscarrying: Being older than 35 Smoking tobacco Drinking alcohol Consuming more than 200mg of caffeine per day (one or two cups) Drug misuse Being obese Having certain long-term health conditions such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism Having certain bacterial and viral infections, such as chlamydia or salmonella Although many resources falsely indicate that a restricted alcohol intake may be acceptable during pregnancy, according to the widely-accepted Dietary Guidelines 2015-2020 , people who are or who may be pregnant should not drink any alcohol. As well as increasing the chances of miscarrying, alcohol consumption may result in negative behavioral or psychological consequences for the child.",
    "diagnosis": "Miscarriages are most commonly diagnosed using a combination of tests, including: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test Pelvic exam Ultrasound Fetal heart scanning It is important for the doctor(s) involved in diagnosing a miscarriage to be certain that the fetus has stopped living, which may involve some or all of these tests and/or waiting up to a week between the first and final scans, in order to complete the diagnosis. This waiting time before a diagnosis is possible can be distressing. However, diagnostic testing is managed in this way to: Reduce any possibility of a misdiagnosis Ensure that any treatments would not be carried out at risk of damaging an ongoing pregnancy In the second trimester (in a late miscarriage), there may be no need for tests to confirm the diagnosis. The miscarriage may be conclusively evidenced by symptoms including: Abdominal pain Bleeding Passing a recognisable pregnancy sac or tissue Delivering the fetus In this instance, tests such as an autopsy on the pregnancy tissue or a placental exam may be performed to help determine the possible cause(s) of the miscarriage.\n\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. This test can be: Qualitative. A qualitative test is carried out to find out whether or not there is hCG in the blood, thereby proving the presence or absence of pregnancy. This is a urine test and is often how a person finds out they are pregnant initially. Quantitative. A quantitative test is carried out to find out the precise amount of hCG in the blood. This is a blood test which is performed by a doctor to discover more information about a particular pregnancy. It might be repeated over a period of days or weeks in order to ascertain whether a person’s hCG levels are rising, decreasing or stabilizing. In a healthy pregnancy, hCG levels will continue to double approximately within the blood throughout the first trimester, reaching their peak at around week 11 of the pregnancy and decreasing slightly during the second trimester. If hCG levels begin to decrease in the first trimester, this is likely to indicate a miscarriage. Wherever possible, this test will be performed in conjunction with ultrasound, fetal heart scanning and a pelvic exam before a miscarriage is diagnosed. However, in cases where ultrasound equipment is unavailable, the hCG blood test may sometimes be the primary means of confirming a suspected diagnosis of miscarriage. 16\n\nA pelvic exam to diagnose miscarriage will be performed by an obstetrician, i.e. a doctor specializing in childbirth, and/or a gynecologist, a doctor specialising in the female reproductive system. During a pelvic exam, a person will wear a loose hospital gown and lie on their back, with their feet in stirrups, so that the vagina and cervix can be easily examined. When diagnosing miscarriage, a doctor will check for the presence of two principal signs indicating miscarriage: The presence of tissue/blood in the cervical/vaginal opening The dilation (opening) of the cervix\n\nUltrasound is an imaging technique which uses soundwaves to create an image of the developing fetus in the body. It is a painless and non-invasive procedure which can be performed by using the scanner in two different ways: 17 Transvaginally, usually before week 11 of pregnancy. In this case, a scanning probe is inserted into the vagina. Transabdominally, usually from 11-12 weeks of pregnancy. Gel is spread on the skin of the lower abdomen, and the scanner is passed over the area. In diagnosing a miscarriage, doctors will look for various indicators in the ultrasound images. These can suggest how far advanced the miscarriage is and what kind of miscarriage is taking place. Indicators of miscarriage may include: An empty pregnancy sac in the uterus Pregnancy tissue but no fetus in the uterus The fetus or embryo is smaller than it should be by this stage of pregnancy No fetal heartbeat, if the pregnancy is far enough advanced to detect it, usually after week seven of pregnancy\n\nThe absence of the fetal heart rate (the baby’s heartbeat) is a principal factor in diagnosing miscarriage. The fetal heart scan is a specialized kind of ultrasound scan. The fetal heart can be scanned by means of ultrasound from around seven weeks into the pregnancy. At 13-14 weeks, the four chambers and great arteries can be clearly imaged, and many congenital heart abnormalities can be detected. 18 As with a regular ultrasound scan, a fetal heart scan is a painless and non-invasive procedure, which can be performed transvaginally or transabdominally. 19",
    "treatment": "If a miscarriage is causing abdominal pain, suitable painkillers will be prescribed or recommended, and one’s doctor will advise on an appropriate dose. It is important not to take any medications, even painkillers, which have not been approved by a doctor. Treatment depends on the type of miscarriage: 4 Some miscarriages do not require any physical treatment, because no pregnancy tissue is left in the womb. This is called a complete miscarriage. In an incomplete miscarriage, some pregnancy tissue comes out of the uterus, but some remains inside. Treatment may be needed to remove the remaining tissue. In a missed miscarriage, there are usually no cramps or bleeding, and the dead fetus remains inside the uterus. Sometimes, pregnancy tissue leaves the uterus, but a form of treatment may be needed to remove the fetus. In a complete miscarriage, without significant blood loss, no further medical or surgical treatment is needed. A person will be given simple aftercare instructions. A person will be advised not to have sexual intercourse or any kind of vaginal penetration until the bleeding associated with the miscarriage has stopped (usually within two weeks after the process begins). Normal menstrual periods usually return 4-6 weeks after a miscarriage. In an incomplete or missed miscarriage, a surgical or medical procedure may be prescribed in some instances in order to clear the uterus of all fetal and pregnancy tissue . Where possible, the course of treatment is left to the discretion of the person who is having the miscarriage. The American Family Physician finds that better mental health outcomes after miscarriage can be expected when a person’s treatment preferences are respected. An incomplete or missed miscarriage can be managed expectantly , medically or surgically .\n\nAlso known as conservative or wait-and-see management, expectant management involves waiting for the tissue to pass out of the womb naturally, which can take up to three weeks. This is the course of action often chosen by people who do not wish to have a medical or surgical procedure. Expectant management is suitable for a person having a missed or incomplete miscarriage who: Prefers passing the pregnancy tissue related to the miscarriage in the privacy of their home Considers the ongoing or intermittent pain levels acceptable - over-the-counter and/or prescription painkillers will be recommended Has no additional health complications that render this option inadvisable Experts on pregnancy loss advise that this course of action is ideal, where suitable, for people having a missed miscarriage who might wish to see, hold and perhaps memorialize their fetus with a burial or cremation, as it can be damaged by some of the more pragmatic miscarriage management procedures, such as dilation and extraction (D&E). People who choose expectant management will need to return to hospital for a check-up on completion of the miscarriage, as there is an increased risk of infection. Medical or surgical intervention may be required if it does not complete as planned. 20\n\nMedical management of miscarriage involves taking medication to cause the uterus to contract, so that the pregnancy tissue passes out of the womb. In most cases, the medication can be taken in the privacy of a person’s home. The medication used is called misoprostol. It can be taken in two forms: 21 Orally as a tablet Vaginally as a pessary, i.e. a tablet which can be inserted into the vagina with a special applicator Misoprostol works by causing cramping and bleeding to empty the uterus. Bleeding usually starts around one hour after taking the medication, and it takes 4-5 hours in total for the full amount of pregnancy tissue to pass. Nausea and diarrhea are common during this period, but are not a cause for concern. Cramping may last for 1-2 days, and associated bleeding and spotting may continue for 4-5 weeks. A doctor will advise on the appropriate timing of the dose(s) and recommend suitable painkillers. If the miscarriage does not occur in the expected timeframe or there are any problems, it is important to consult a doctor. Surgery may be necessary to complete the process of miscarriage. The recovery time after a medically-induced miscarriage is usually around four weeks, with a medical check-up usually scheduled for 1-2 weeks after taking the medication. Avoiding sexual activity until one’s next menstrual period is recommended to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nProcedures which may be recommended following a miscarriage include: Manual vacuum aspiration Dilation and curettage (D&C) Dilation and extraction (D&E)\n\nThis procedure is usually recommended for first-trimester miscarriages or as a means of removing leftover pregnancy tissue when the fetus has already passed out of the womb. A device is inserted into the cervix to empty the womb of all pregnancy tissue and fetal matter, using gentle suction. This procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic and takes around 10-15 minutes. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure. Light cramping and period-like pain can be expected afterwards. This usually settles within seven days. 23 Manual vacuum aspiration is used much more frequently as a treatment option than dilation and curettage or dilation and extraction (below).\n\nThis procedure is usually recommended for people having first-trimester miscarriages. D&C is usually performed under general anesthetic, but can also be carried out using local anesthetic via an intravenous therapy (IV) drip. The vagina is dilated using a device called a speculum, and the contents of the uterus are removed using an instrument called a curette, which scrapes the pregnancy tissue and fetal matter out of the uterine wall. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure. A person can undergo D&C as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended. 24\n\nThis procedure is usually recommended for people having second-trimester miscarriages. D&E is almost always performed under general anesthetic, but can be carried out using local anesthetic via an IV drip. During the procedure, the vagina is dilated using a speculum, and forceps (a grasping instrument) is used to remove the foetus. Often, the fetus may need to be divided into parts before it can be removed. Medications to help the cervix dilate are usually given before the procedure. After the fetus is removed, a curette is used to scrape any remaining pregnancy tissue from the uterine wall. A person can undergo D&E as an outpatient procedure in most cases and return to normal activity around 24 hours afterwards. Light cramping and bleeding may last for up to two weeks, and appropriate painkillers, usually ibuprofen, will be recommended. 25\n\nPost-miscarriage intervention is psychological treatment following a miscarriage which focuses on helping one to overcome the feelings of grief, self-blame and worry that are commonly associated with miscarrying. It is very common to feel distressed following a miscarriage, and for some people these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated. The Miscarriage Association suggests that feelings associated with miscarrying might affect a person in a variety of different ways, including: Guilt. Even though it is very unlikely that any given miscarriage could have been prevented, it is normal for a person to feel guilt after miscarrying, particularly if they were subject to any risk factors, such as a long-term health condition or a history of smoking, which may render miscarriage more likely. Anger and jealousy. It is normal to feel anger in a variety of ways, including anger towards one’s own situation, oneself and hospital staff, and jealousy towards others who have never experienced a miscarriage or on hearing others’ pregnancy announcements. Sadness. It is normal to feel sad and tearful, either in relation to specific thoughts or with no obvious trigger. Shock and confusion. These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was progressing healthily prior to the miscarriage. Physical emptiness. It is common for a person to feel acutely aware that they are no longer carrying a developing fetus, particularly if they had been acutely monitoring their sensations during pregnancy. Panic. A miscarriage can be an intensely stressful experience and a sensation of loss of control is common in the weeks following it. Numbness. Although a miscarriage can be distressing for many people, it is also possible for a person to feel an absence of intense feelings and to find this distressing in itself. Loneliness, Many people, who have experienced a miscarriage, report the sensation that others do not understand how they are feeling. There are many organizations which can connect a person with others who have shared the experience of miscarriage. This can be an effective way to alleviate the feelings of loneliness that often accompany this impactful life event. There are many different formats of post-miscarriage intervention available for people affected by a miscarriage, which can help a person to process the experience and avoid developing long-term depression and anxiety. These include: One-on-one counseling Group counseling, for both partners and/or other family members Miscarriage support groups with other people who have experienced miscarriage Healthcare providers will be able to direct people and families, who have experienced a miscarriage, towards available services and can provide advice on choosing the most appropriate kind of support for the affected person, couple or family.",
    "prevention": "In most cases, it is not possible to prevent a miscarriage. However, it is possible to reduce the risk of miscarrying and to increase the potential of treating any complications of pregnancy that arise before they result in a miscarriage. This requires good antenatal care – a care plan devised with one’s doctor to increase the chances of a healthy pregnancy. Antenatal care generally involves: Having regular medical check-ups to ascertain the health of the pregnant person and developing fetus Avoiding alcohol, tobacco, excess caffeine and other substances associated with an increased risk of miscarrying Avoiding environments and situations which are associated with an increased risk of miscarrying Eating a recommended pregnancy diet Ensuring that any pre-existing medical conditions which may affect pregnancy are adequately managed prior to conception to reduce their potential impact on the pregnancy If you are considering becoming pregnanct and suspect you may have an undiagnosed medical condition due to the presence of unexplained symptoms, you can get a free symptom assessment.",
    "miscarriage_faqs": "Q: What are the most common misconceptions about the causes of miscarriage? A: There are several widespread myths about certain factors being causes of miscarriage. Many pregnant people avoid air travel, eating spicy food and having sexual relations during pregnancy, but these activities are not medically linked to miscarrying. It is also common to avoid exercise during pregnancy with the aim of preventing a miscarriage. However, as long as an exercise programme has been approved by a doctor, it is safe for a pregnant person to carry out without risk to the developing fetus. 10 Read more about the Causes of Miscarriage » Q: If a pregnant person experiences cramping, vaginal bleeding or discharge, does this mean they are having a miscarriage? A: Not necessarily. Vaginal bleeding is common in early pregnancy. Bleeding may occur due to the implantation of the fertilized egg in the uterus (implantation bleeding), and discharge can be caused by more blood than normal flowing to the pelvic area during pregnancy. However, bleeding and cramping may indicate a miscarriage, and a pregnant person should always consult their doctor if they experience vaginal bleeding in order to confirm the status of the developing fetus. Read more about the Signs of Miscarriage » Q: How soon after a miscarriage can a person have sex and/or try to become pregnant again? A: For most people, the vaginal bleeding associated with a miscarriage lasts for under two weeks. During the period of vaginal bleeding, the uterus and cervix may remain dilated. This renders the vaginal area at increased risk of contracting bacterial infections. The risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding sexual activity involving the vagina until the bleeding has stopped. Waiting until after the next period before trying to conceive is recommended after a miscarriage. It is possible to become pregnant as soon as a new egg is released and fertilized by a sperm, which may happen as soon as a new reproductive cycle begins in the female body. Although it is therefore possible to become pregnant very soon after a miscarriage, waiting until the next period is recommended for two principal reasons: it increases one’s chances of accurately dating the new pregnancy, and it allows for the womb and cervix to return to their normal function following the miscarriage, helping to ensure hospitable conditions for the new developing fetus. Q: Is a person who has had a miscarriage more likely than others to miscarry in future? A: Having a miscarriage is not an indication that a person will miscarry in the future. Many people experience one or more miscarriages before going on to have a healthy pregnancy. If a person experiences more than one miscarriage, they may wish to undergo tests to identify any underlying conditions which may be causing them to miscarry. However, it is possible to experience recurrent miscarriages without discerning an underlying cause and to then go on to have a healthy pregnancy.",

    "condition": "Molar Pregnancy",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/molar-pregnancy/",
    "what_is_a_molar_pregnancy": "A molar pregnancy, sometimes called a hydatidiform mole, is a rare complication of pregnancy . It forms part of a group of disorders known as gestation trophoblastic disease (GTD), in which tumors grow inside a woman’s uterus. A molar pregnancy results from a problem, which is related to the genetic makeup of the fused egg and sperm, and which occurs during conception. This causes a fluid-filled mass of tissue to grow inside the womb, instead of a healthy pregnancy. A molar pregnancy will not develop into a baby. A molar pregnancy will often have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy in its early stages and may go undetected until the first routine ultrasound scan, if it is not miscarried before this time. Most molar pregnancies are diagnosed in the first trimester, before any classic signs and symptoms are present. However, symptoms which could indicate a molar pregnancy include vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting, tummy growth which can be faster or slower than normal, and signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism . 1 2 A molar pregnancy can be removed, and most people will make a full recovery. Very rarely, it may become cancerous. However, cancers that develop from molar pregnancies tend to have a very good prognosis, with a high cure rate of nearly 100 percent. 3 Molar pregnancy affects about one in every 1.000 or 2.000 pregnant women. 4 The reported incidence varies widely in different regions of the world. Many people experience emotional distress after having a molar pregnancy , particularly if it is felt as a loss if it occurs during a planned pregnancy, or if chemotherapy is necessary. A range of therapeutic treatment options are available. If you are worried that you may have a molar pregnancy, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",
    "molar_pregnancy_symptoms": "Molar pregnancy often has no symptoms differing from a normal pregnancy and is frequently diagnosed during a routine ultrasound. However, the most common signs and symptoms that could indicate molar pregnancy are: 5 6 Vaginal bleeding early in the pregnancy, which may contain little fluid-filled sacs High level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (pregnancy hormone) Bigger abdomen (tummy) than expected for the number of weeks pregnant Pelvic pressure or pain. Less common signs and symptoms include: 5 Hyperemesis gravidarum : severe nausea and vomiting Early onset preeclampsia : high blood pressure in pregnancy Signs of an overactive thyroid, known as hyperthyroidism, such as nervousness, insomnia and heart palpitations. Worried you may be experiencing a molar pregnancy? Check your symptoms with the Ada app .",
    "molar_pregnancy_causes": "A molar pregnancy occurs when there is a problem with the genetic information of a fused ovum (egg) and sperm. While a molar pregnancy cannot be predicted, because little is known about how and why it occurs, factors that are thought to increase the chances of having one include: 6 7 Being younger than age 15 or older than age 35 A history of molar pregnancy A history of miscarriage A diet low in carotene (a form of vitamin A)\n\nA molar pregnancy may be complete or incomplete, depending on the number of chromosomes in the fertilized egg. In normal conception, a single sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 23 chromosomes, making 46 in all.\n\nMost molar pregnancies are complete. 8 Once ovulation occurs, one sperm, or sometimes two, fertilize an egg that has no genetic material. No embryo will grow, because there are no chromosomes from the mother, but two sets from the father. Normally, a fertilized empty egg dies, but in rare cases it implants in the uterine wall. This causes trophoblast cells, the cells that would become a placenta, to grow rapidly into clusters of fluid-filled sacs called cysts or a complete mole. 9 10\n\nA partial mole occurs when two sperm fertilize the egg instead of one. This means that there are 69 instead of 46 chromosomes, creating too much genetic material. There may initially be a fetus, but it will be genetically abnormal and cannot survive, while the trophoblastic cells will grow rapidly, filling the womb with cysts. 9 10",
    "molar_pregnancy_complications": "In some cases, after removal of a molar pregnancy, a number of cells may remain behind and develop into gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), which is cancerous and can be very serious if left untreated. However, GTN has a very good prognosis, with a near 100 percent cure rate. There are several types of GTN that can result from a molar pregnancy, including: Invasive mole: Also known as an invasive hydatidiform mole or chorioadenoma destruens, this is where part of the mole remains in the body and can grow quickly into a locally invasive tumor. This is more likely to occur after a complete molar pregnancy. Choriocarcinoma: This is the most aggressive form of GTN, a cancer which grows from the placenta and can metastasize (spread) throughout the body if left untreated. It can also occur postpartum after a healthy pregnancy or a miscarriage, but those with a molar pregnancy are at a higher risk. 11 Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) : This tumor is a very rare form of GTN that develops where the placenta attaches to the uterus lining. It most often develops months to years after a normal pregnancy, but may also develop after a spontaneous abortion or after a molar pregnancy is removed. 12 Most PSTTs do not spread to other sites in the body, but they do have a tendency to grow into the muscle layer of the uterus. Unlike most other forms of GTN, PSTTs are, in many cases, not sensitive to chemotherapy. Instead, they are most often treated with surgery, usually removal of the womb to remove disease completely and, occasionally, with chemotherapy. ref15",
    "molar_pregnancy_ultrasound_diagnosis": "Molar pregnancies are commonly discovered during the first routine ultrasound scan of a pregnancy. If a person develops bleeding in early pregnancy, the doctor will normally arrange a scan, in which case the condition may be found sooner. The image from the ultrasound scan may be characteristic of a molar pregnancy, showing cysts that resemble a cluster of grapes, in which case the condition will be treated. It may also reveal enlarged ovaries caused by non-cancerous ovarian cysts stemming from abnormally high amounts of the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Often, however, the image may resemble that of a miscar riage . The further along the molar pregnancy is, the more characteristic the ultrasound picture becomes. If the doctor suspects a molar pregnancy, a blood test will be ordered to check if the hCG levels are higher than normal, far higher in comparison to possible hCG levels that may occur in normal pregnancies. See these resources for more information on miscarriage and signs of miscarriage. If there is both an ultrasound image that looks like a miscarriage and higher-than-normal hCG levels, the person will be treated to remove the abnormal tissue in the uterus. Tissue miscarried or removed from the uterus will be sent to a laboratory and tests will be done to see if molar tissue is present. A molar pregnancy diagnosis can then be confirmed. Malignant trophoblastic tumors primarily metastasize to the lungs, so once diagnosis of a molar pregnancy is confirmed, this should be ruled out by taking a baseline chest radiograph. 13 There may be a delay of a few days or weeks between treatment and the receipt of confirmation that the person had a molar pregnancy. 10",
    "molar_pregnancy_treatment": "Treatment for a molar pregnancy usually takes the form of dilation and curettage (D&C), sometimes known as surgical uterine evacuation, dilation and evacuation, surgical management of miscarriage (SMM), evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC) or a scrape. This is a minor operation done under general anesthetic, in which the cervix, the passage leading from the uterus to the vagina, is dilated so that abnormal tissue in the uterus can be removed with suction and a spoon-like instrument (curette). There is likely to be vaginal bleeding for up to six weeks after surgery, which may be heavy at first. Women who have completed childbearing may have the option of hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the womb.\n\nThere is a small risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after a molar pregnancy has been treated. GTN is a serious condition that requires rapid treatment, so all women who have had molar pregnancies should be monitored afterwards. During a molar pregnancy, hCG (pregnancy hormone) levels rise, but should return to normal once the person has been treated. For at least six months after the end of treatment for a molar pregnancy, hCG levels will typically be monitored through urine tests. If they do not return to normal, this could indicate GTN. It is important to take steps to avoid becoming pregnant for about six months after treatment, as this would interfere with the monitoring of hCG levels for signs of GTN. After a complete mole, the likelihood of developing GTN is significantly increased. After a partial mole, this risk only increases slightly. The reported incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) after each type of molar pregnancy is: Complete mole: 15-20 percent Partial mole: 1-5 percent",
    "molar_pregnancy_and_emotions": "It is normal to feel stress after a molar pregnancy and, in some people, these emotions can develop into depression and anxiety if left untreated. The Miscarriage Association suggests that a person with molar pregnancy might experience a variety of associated feelings, including: Shock and confusion. These emotions are especially common if the pregnancy was planned and thought to be healthy prior to an ultrasound scan or miscarriage. It can be shocking for a person to find out they have a condition which they probably never heard of before. Fear and anxiety. A molar pregnancy may lead to fear of the possibility of having cancer, and fear that problems will happen again with any future pregnancies. Loss and grief. It is normal to feel grief if a baby was expected. Feeling stuck. It is common to feel stuck if wanting to try to conceive again and having to wait some time while having follow-up and repeated blood and urine tests. Counseling is available for people affected by a molar pregnancy. Support groups such as MyMolarPregnancy.com are also available and may be able to put a person in touch with others in a similar situation. Health practitioners will be able to provide advice to those affected by a molar pregnancy on choosing the most appropriate kind of support and direct them towards available services.",
    "other_names_for_molar_pregnancy": "Hydatidiform mole Complete mole Partial mole",
    "molar_pregnancy_faqs": "Q: Can a molar pregnancy survive? A: No, a molar pregnancy cannot develop into a baby, as it does not have a correct set of chromosomes. Molar pregnancies may at first seem to have the same symptoms as a normal pregnancy and generate a positive result on a pregnancy test. In the case of complete molar pregnancy, no fetus will develop. In a partial molar pregnancy, fetal tissue may initially develop, it will, however, be genetically abnormal and cannot survive and will be overtaken by rapidly-growing cysts. Q: Will a person who has had a molar pregnancy be able to have a normal pregnancy in future? A: Yes, a molar pregnancy will not normally cause infertility or lead to complications with future pregnancies. 9 The chances of another molar pregnancy is increased, but is still only around 1-2 percent. The recurrence rate after two molar pregnancies has been reported to range from 11 to 25 percent. However, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least six months after the end of molar pregnancy treatment, to allow hCG monitoring for remaining molar tissue. If chemotherapy follow-up treatment has been used, a person should take measures to avoid becoming pregnant for at least one year after the end of treatment, to allow for hCG monitoring and also to allow the chemotherapy, which can be very damaging to an unborn baby, to clear the body. Q: Blighted ovum vs molar pregnancy: what is the difference? A: Blighted ovum, also known as anembryonic pregnancy, is a condition in which a fertilized egg attaches itself to the uterine wall, but there is no embryo development, usually due to chromosomal abnormalities or abnormal cell division. Molar pregnancy is caused by chromosomal abnormalities due to abnormal conception, and causes a mass of fluid-filled cysts to grow, instead of a healthy pregnancy. Blighted ovum and partial molar pregnancy can look similar on an ultrasound. However, a partial mole usually shows the remains of embryonic tissue, which never appears in a blighted ovum. 14 Q: What is the outcome if there is a twin pregnancy with a molar pregnancy and a live baby? A: In extremely rare cases, there may be a viable fetus co-existing with a molar pregnancy in the uterus. It may be possible for the pregnancy to continue; in as many as 40 percent of these cases, the woman is able to give birth to a baby that survives. However, the risk of the mother developing persistent trophoblastic disease is higher, making continuing the pregnancy a risk. 15"

There is no specific treatment method that works for all women. Instead, women are encouraged to try a variety of methods to see what works for them. To help manage mild cases of morning sickness, simple lifestyle changes may be recommended. These include: 5 Getting plenty of rest Avoiding smells, foods or anything else that may trigger nausea, which could include stuffy and/or noisy rooms, heat and humidity Eating small and frequent meals, perhaps every one to two hours and high in carbohydrates and low in fat Drinking plenty of fluids Eating food or drink containing ginger, which, evidence suggests, is a natural antiemetic (vomiting suppressant) If lifestyle changes do not help to remedy the morning sickness, a doctor may prescribe pregnancy-friendly anti-sickness medication (antiemetics). Often, this will be a form of vitamin B6 called pyridoxine, which may be used in combination with a specific antihistamine – doxylamine – which is usually used to treat allergies, but which can also be effective at preventing sickness. The medication will generally be in tablet form, though an injection or suppository may be used if the individual is unable to keep down fluids. 5 The medications used to treat morning sickness are safe for use in pregnancy and will have no effect on the development of the baby. However, before taking any type of medication, always seek the opinion of a doctor. In a small number of cases, those that resemble hyperemesis gravidarum, morning sickness may need to be treated in a hospital. This will only be necessary if the individual does not respond to treatment and is consequently losing weight and becoming dehydrated. In the hospital, fluids will be administered intravenously (through a drip) to prevent dehydration.\n\nThere are a number of alternative treatment methods for morning sickness. Acupuncture and acupressure have become particularly popular. The first is a technique derived from ancient Chinese medicine involving the insertion of fine needles into certain points on the body; the latter is a technique similar to acupuncture, involving the application of pressure to certain points on the body, often using a specially designed wristband. Both techniques can be self-administered and do not require a prescription, making them easily accessible to most women. Although neither technique is medically proven beyond doubt to be effective besides the possibility of a placebo effect, both are considered to be safe during pregnancy and may help on an individual basis. 6 Hypnosis is also considered safe and may be helpful in the relief of symptoms for some patients. Psychotherapy, likewise, can also be useful and supportive for some women, especially those whose symptoms are exacerbated by anxiety and stress surrounding the pregnancy. 6 Most other alternative treatment methods have not been studied comprehensively and should therefore be avoided. This includes marijuana, which is not considered safe for consumption during pregnancy by most medical professionals. 6",
    "morning_sickness_prognosis": "The majority of women who experience morning sickness will recover completely and experience no further problems related to the condition. Some women may not gain weight in the first half of pregnancy as a consequence of morning sickness, but this is only cause for concern if the individual is already significantly underweight. 1 If there is any concern about morning sickness, contact a doctor or midwife for help and advice.",
    "morning_sickness_faqs": "Q: Is morning sickness a complication of pregnancy? A: No, morning sickness is a normal part of pregnancy that affects a large amount of women. However, complications can occur if the condition is severe and progresses into a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum, which can cause dehydration and low birth weight. Read more about Pregnancy Complications » Q: Will morning sickness affect my baby? A: Morning sickness will usually cause no harm to the baby. If you experience hyperemesis gravidarum and it is left untreated or treated late, however, this may have a negative effect on the pregnancy. This effect may be a low birth weight. Q: Are there any natural remedies for the relief of morning sickness? A: There are a variety of natural remedies that may help with the management of mild morning sickness. These include: 7 Ginger: Research suggests eating or drinking foods containing ginger can act as a natural antiemetic. Relaxation: Taking steps to relax can help to reduce stress, something that may contribute to morning sickness. Vitamin B6: Eating foods rich in vitamin B6, such as bananas, avocado and chicken, may help ease morning sickness. Peppermint: Tea or other drinks containing peppermint may help ease morning sickness. Always talk to a doctor or midwife before beginning to use any morning sickness remedies. Q: Can I experience morning sickness at night? A: Yes, a rarer kind of morning sickness may also occur at night, or indeed at any time of the day. 8 Morning sickness at night can be particularly troublesome, as it can prevent women from falling asleep or even wake them during the night. As feelings of nausea often occur on an empty stomach, one possible way to help prevent sickness at night is to eat a light snack in the evening, before bed. 9 While this method is worth trying, it will not be effective for all women. Women experiencing persistent morning sickness at night should speak to their doctor or midwife. Q: What does it mean if I experience no morning sickness? A: Research has suggested that there may be a link between morning sickness and a lower chance of miscarriage, based on the idea that it protects the fetus against bacteria and toxins contained in food and drink. 10 Nonetheless, women who do not experience morning sickness should not worry excessively. Every pregnancy is different, and the evidence for this protective factor theory is yet to be fully confirmed. 11"

    "condition": "Multiple Myeloma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/multiple-myeloma/",
    "what_is_multiple_myeloma": "Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where blood cells are made and mature. Myeloma is caused by a white blood cell called a plasma cell, which normally work to produce proteins which fight infections (antibodies). When a plasma cell cancer occurs, the plasma cells not only grow out of control in the bone marrow, but also impair the ability of the bone marrow to make other healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is so named because the cancer is often found in several different bones. Symptoms of multiple myeloma may be the result of decreased normal blood cells, such as paleness, shortness of breath, feeling more tired than usual and bleeding gums, or the result of quick growth of the cancer cells, such as unexpected weight loss, bone pain or fragile bones. There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Myeloma is usually a slow-growing cancer, and for this reason, the outlook depends on factors such the age of the person diagnosed, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the development of complications.",
    "risks": "Multiple myeloma is a cancer which affects cells which are growing in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside bones where all blood cells grow and mature. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell that help the body fight infections by producing proteins called antibodies. Myeloma is a cancer that arises from abnormal plasma cells, causing them to multiply quickly. This overgrowth of plasma cells crowds the growth of healthy blood cells, which affects the body's ability to transport oxygen, clot when bleeding, and fight infections. These plasma cells also produce extra proteins, which can damage the kidneys. The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. However, the risk of developing a multiple myeloma increases with age. It rarely affects people under 40 years and is mostly diagnosed by the age of 70. Men are more likely than women to develop this condition.",
    "symptoms": "Common symptoms include paleness, shortness of breath, feeling tired and bleeding gums. Other symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain and fragile bones. Some people may suffer blood clots, recurrent infections or kidney problems. There may be no symptoms in the early stages of this condition, because symptoms develop as the disease progresses.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and physical examination, but can only be confirmed with further testing. Blood tests can show if there is a problem with blood cell production, and urine tests may show extra protein as a result of the increased activity of the plasma cells. A PET scan (a special type of CT scan) may be done to look for other sites of multiple myeloma around the body. A small sample of the bone marrow (biopsy) is taken with a needle and is checked for cancer cells.",
    "treatment": "There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but there are treatment options that help to control the disease. Treatment may involve a combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation. The exact combination of therapies depends on the stage of the disease, the general health of the affected person and whether any complications have occurred. The treating doctor can give the best advice for treatment in individual cases. Complications such as bone pain, fracture, anemia and kidney damage may require specific treatment."

The cause of this nerve damage is unknown, but may be related to an overactive immune system. This condition is more common in women than men, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 60. Because all of the nerves in the body can be affected, the symptoms of MS also vary from person to person. The most common symptoms are vision problems, strange sensations in the arms and legs and muscle weakness. MS is diagnosed by a specialist neurologist and by having magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

Muscle strains can be acute, sudden and severe in the beginning, or chronic, persisting for a long time or constantly recurring. Typical forms of musculoskeletal strains are: Back strain Hip strain Wrist strain Ankle strain Calf muscle strain The most common form is muscle strain in the back. Symptoms may include pain, swelling, muscle spasms, and reduced ability to move a muscle. 2 Treatment of strains includes conservative measures at the initial phase; this consists of resting the injured area and applying ice and compression with a bandage. Treatment with medication is also possible. 1 2 . If you think you or a beloved one may be experiencing symptoms of muscle strain, try the free Ada app for a quick health assessment.",
    "causes": "Muscle strains most commonly occur in the setting of increased eccentric muscle load on the body. Eccentric force is when muscles contract while elongating, resulting in excessive force and damage. 3 Injuries to the muscle or tendon can present in 2 forms, either suddenly or developing over time. A strain injury can result from twisting or pulling a muscle or tendon. An acute strain is associated with recent trauma or injury. It also can occur after lifting heavy objects or over-stressing the muscles. Chronic strains are caused mainly by muscle overuse due to too much physical activity, inadequate warming up before physical activity or poor flexibility. 1 Repetitive movement of the muscles and tendons can lead to a prolonged injury. The most common sites are back and hamstring muscles. Many people get strains from playing sports. 2",

    "muscle_strain_treatment": "Most muscle strains in clinical practice do not require surgery; a full recovery can almost always be expected. The initial approach to treating musculoskeletal strains is conservative methods that can be combined with medical therapy.\n\nThe first step in treating strains is to initiate PRICE protocol within the first couple of days of injury. This consists of: 9 10 P rotection of the affected area R est I ce (application of an ice pack around the injury up to 20 minutes every 2-3 hours) C ompression of the injury with a bandage E levation (keeping the affected area raised).\n\nDrug therapy may not be necessary but can be used to control symptoms of pain and inflammation. It's important to always consult your doctor before starting any medication. Paracetamol is a common painkiller that is used to reduce pain symptoms. It can be purchased over the counter and used within the first days of injury. The recommended dose for adults is one to two 500mg tablets, four times a day. 11 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen can reduce pain and limit inflammation in the affected area. You can acquire NSAIDs over the counter in topical gel and tablet forms. The effectiveness of topical NSAIDs is questionable; however, there are fewer side effects. It's important to note that excessive use may delay the natural healing process. 9 10 12\n\nLike all medications, NSAIDs do have side effects. These are more common if you're taking high doses for a long time or are elderly or in poor general health. 12 Possible side effects include: Indigestion Stomach ulcer Headaches Drowsiness Dizziness Allergic reactions In rare cases, liver, kidney, heart or blood circulation problems can arise, such as heart failure, heart attack and strokes.

    "what_is_myasthenia_gravis": "Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition that causes muscles to become weak and quickly tired. In this condition the immune system mistakenly produces proteins that fight infections (antibodies) that attack the the body's healthy tissues. These interfere with the ability of nerves to pass information to muscles. Often the muscles of the eyes and eyelids are affected, causing the common symptoms of eyelid drooping and blurred vision. Muscle weakness typically becomes more noticeable over the course of the day or with exertion and improves on resting. Medication is available that improves the communication between nerves and muscles and thus increases the muscles strength, but there is no sure cure for this condition.",
    "risks": "Myasthenia gravis is a rare condition. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly produces proteins that fight infections (antibodies) against parts of the muscles responsible for transmitting impulses from the nerves to make muscles work. This causes the muscles to work slowly and become weak. The reason why this occurs is uncertain, though it is thought than an overactive thymus gland may be partially responsible. Women are slightly more likely than men to develop this condition, and it tends to become more common with age.",
    "symptoms": "The main symptom of myasthenia gravis is a muscle weakness which gets worse over the course of the day. The most commonly affected muscles are the eye, face and throat. People with myasthenia gravis may notice that their eyelids droop, that they develop blurred or double vision or difficulties with chewing, talking or swallowing. Sometimes the muscles of the limbs or the neck can be affected. This may cause problems with walking, posture and balance. People with myasthenia gravis may experience a period during which their symptoms become much worse than normal. These episodes can cause weakness of the breathing muscles and lead to severe breathing difficulty with an inability to cough.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and neurological examination, but a blood test for the antibodies is the only way to confirm the diagnosis. Other tests of nerve and muscle function may help to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "myasthenia_gravis_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can put people with myasthenia gravis at risk of severe symptoms as they have a weakened immune system. Taking the necessary precautions and getting tested as soon as possible is vital if you start experiencing symptoms. Antiviral medication is available to support your immune system.",
    "treatment": "Muscle weakness can be improved by taking medication that improves the communication between nerves and muscles. Medications to dampen the immune system, such as steroids and immuno-suppressant medications, are also commonly used. In cases of a severe deterioration of muscle strength, medications may need to be given through the veins to suppress the immune system. In some cases, removal of the thymus gland can improve the symptoms, but this does not cause immediate improvement."

To remove the blockage, the person having the heart attack will have medications to thin the blood. Sometimes urgent cardiac catheterization (a tube through the leg blood vessels into the heart blood vessels) is done to find and remove the blockage. If the blockage or narrowing is severe, the doctor may put a stent (a small wire cage) into the blood vessel to widen the vessel. It is important to have urgent treatment in order to prevent heart muscle damage. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation (physical therapy) is important to help the heart regain strength.",

    "condition": "Myocarditis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/myocarditis/",
    "what_is_myocarditis": "The definition of myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, the myocardium. Myocarditis can reduce the ability of the heart to pump, affecting circulation, and in severe cases it may lead to heart failure and other serious complications. The most common cause of myocarditis is a viral infection. Other causes of myocarditis may include: 1 2 3 Bacteria, such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the bacteria that causes diphtheria. Myocarditis caused by bacteria is called bacterial myocarditis Parasites, such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the organism that causes Chagas’ disease Autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus Certain medications Drug abuse Excessive alcohol consumption Chemotherapy 4 Radiation therapy Myocarditis can affect anyone of any age, but it most commonly occurs in otherwise healthy young adults. 1 2 It is slightly more prevalent in men than women. 5 In 2013, there were 1.5 million reported cases of myocardial inflammation around the world, or approximately 22 instances for every 100,000 people. 6 Myocarditis may be mild, causing few or no symptoms, or severe, causing life-threatening heart failure. Where present, myocarditis symptoms may include: 1 2 7 Fatigue Dip in performance during physical activity, such as exercise Chest pain Rapid heartbeat Shortness of breath Palpitations Swelling of the legs Fever Many cases of acute viral myocarditis clear up on their own within a few days or weeks, leaving no negative health effects. Treatment typically involves bed rest and avoiding physical exercise for several months. Other types of myocarditis may require treatment with antibiotics or steroids. In some cases, the condition may persist or recur and can cause serious complications. Treatment with heart medications, a pacemaker and surgery may sometimes be necessary. 1",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of myocarditis vary widely and some people do not present with any heart-related symptoms at all. In these cases, myocardial inflammation may be detected when an ECG (electrocardiogram) test shows abnormalities. The main symptoms of myocarditis in adults may include: 1 2 3 Fatigue: More than half of those affected complain of this symptom and a dip in performance during physical activity Chest pain or pressure: Over one third of people complain of this symptom Fever Shortness of breath Palpitations Rapid heartbeat Irregular heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) The affected person may also present with lightheadedness, fainting and swelling of the legs. The symptoms depend on the cause of the inflammation, as well as its severity. If any symptoms are present and myocarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately. In some cases, myocarditis can cause serious complications, including heart failure, stroke and sudden death.",
    "causes": "Viruses are the most common cause of myocarditis. The Coxsackie virus is one of the most frequently implicated in viral myocarditis in Western Europe and North America, 6 but many other viruses can trigger myocarditis, including: 1 2 3 Parvovirus B-19 (fifth disease) Adenovirus ( common cold ) Influenza virus Human herpes virus 6 ( roseola ) Epstein-Barr (glandular fever) virus Rubella (German measles) Varicella ( chicken pox ) Mumps Measles Enteroviruses Hepatitis A and C HIV Myocarditis may develop while the viral infection is present or shortly afterwards. Bacterial infection, most commonly diphtheria, may also cause myocarditis. 3 In addition, Lyme disease , Chagas’ disease caused by infection with the protozoan organism Trypanosoma cruzi via insect bites in tropical countries, 1 and various other parasites, bacteria and fungi can cause myocarditis. Other myocarditis causes include: 1 3 Allergic reactions to medications Heavy metal poisoning, such as lead or iron Exposure to other poisons Exposure to radiation Excess alcohol Electric shock Rejection of the heart following a heart transplant Illicit drug use, such as amphetamines and cocaine Though rare, myocarditis may also result as a complication of some autoimmune conditions, such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus , as well as severe hyperthyroidism that leads to thyroid storm . 8\n\nVery rarely, a condition called idiopathic giant cell myocarditis may occur. It is typically seen in otherwise young adults who are otherwise in good health, though it may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease. In giant cell myocarditis, which is often fatal, 9 abnormal cells develop in the heart muscle. Treatment for giant cell myocarditis typically involves medication to suppress the immune system. In some cases, a heart transplant may be necessary. 10",
    "myocarditis_diagnosis": "After taking the medical history of the affected person and performing a physical examination, a doctor will typically request an ECG (electrocardiogram), sometimes called an EKG, to assess the functioning of the heart muscle (myocardium). They may also order blood tests to look for: 1 2 11 12 13 Infections Underlying health conditions, such as type 1 diabetes or systemic lupus erythematosus Markers of inflammation Markers of damage to the heart muscle, such as cardiac troponin - a type of protein that may be found at elevated levels in myocarditis Other tests that may be carried out include: 1 2 3 11 Chest X-ray to check the size and shape of the heart and whether there is any fluid buildup; pulmonary edema is a sign of heart failure Heart ultrasound scan (echocardiogram) Heart MRI to assess tissue damage Occasionally, an endomyocardial biopsy may be performed. This entails removing a small tissue sample from the heart and testing it to determine the cause(s) of the myocarditis. 1 3 11 Endomyocardial biopsy and cardiac MRI are the preferred diagnostic tests for distinguishing myocarditis from other conditions that affect the heart. 14",
    "treatment": "In many cases, myocarditis can be treated.  The treatment recommended depends on the cause and the severity of the symptoms. During treatment, tobacco and alcohol should be avoided.\n\nPeople who have been diagnosed with myocarditis should rest and avoid physical exertion, including exercise, for several months to avoid straining the heart muscle. Myocarditis recovery times vary, and a medical practitioner will be able to advise when exercise can be resumed safely.\n\nPainkillers and anti-inflammatory medication may be prescribed for the management of fever, chest pain and discomfort. If the symptoms of myocarditis are mild, no other treatment, besides bed rest, may be needed. 1 3 15\n\nWhere possible, the underlying cause of the myocarditis should be addressed. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, while steroids may be needed to treat giant cell myocarditis. 1 If an autoimmune condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus is implicated, this should be treated. 11\n\nWhere myocarditis symptoms are severe, hospitalization may be necessary. People presenting with heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias may require urgent treatment with the following: 15 Oxygen Diuretics, vasodilators and other medication to treat heart failure Anticoagulants to prevent blood clots Medication or, in some cases, a pacemaker to treat arrhythmia A defibrillator 2 Some of these treatments may need to be continued to support the heart and blood pressure until the myocardium recovers.",
    "complications": "In many cases, the prognosis is good, and myocarditis clears up on its own, without any complications or long-term health effects. However, sometimes the heart sustains damage, leaving a degree of heart failure that requires lifelong management. 1 This may involve lifestyle changes and chronic medication. 11 In cases where the damage to the heart muscle is severe, a heart transplant may be necessary. ref1 Myocarditis can be fatal. Death may occur if the condition worsens after diagnosis and becomes unresponsive to treatment. It may also occur suddenly where acute myocarditis has a rapid onset. 1\n\nA possible complication of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy is a condition where the heart becomes chronically enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. 2 The myocardium dilates, stretching and becoming thinner. As a result, the heart weakens and heart failure may occur. Dilated cardiomyopathy may also cause arrhythmias, blood clots and heart valve problems. 16 The risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy from myocarditis, or in general, is low. It is estimated that, overall, two in 10,000 people develop this condition, with myocarditis only one possible cause. Dilated cardiomyopathy typically affects adults between 20 and 60 years of age, and it is more common in males. A genetic predisposition may be present. 17 Symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy range from none to possibly including the following: 17 Heart failure Stroke Arrhythmias Sudden cardiac death. To diagnose dilated cardiomyopathy, among other tests, doctors may use: Chest X-rays ECG tests Echocardiograms Treatment is the same as for heart failure and may involve: 17 Diuretics (water pills) Beta-blockers (blood pressure medication) Anticoagulants (blood thinners) Pacemakers Defibrillators In cases where dilated cardiomyopathy does not respond to treatment, a heart transplant may be required. Good to know: Cardiomyopathy is the medical term for muscular dysfunction of the heart, which can lead to electrical and/or mechanical problems. There are several different types of cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis are not the same thing. However, cardiomyopathy can result from myocarditis. Though confusing, myocarditis is also sometimes known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy. 18 19\n\nIn a small number of cases, myocarditis may persist and become chronic or long lasting. Chronic myocarditis is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and may lead to heart failure and other serious complications. Treatment may involve long-term use of steroid medication or a heart transplant operation. 13\n\nMyocarditis can also lead to other complications, including atrial fibrillation , an irregular heartbeat that can cause serious problems, and blood clots that may result in a stroke.",
    "prevention": "While it is difficult to prevent myocarditis, taking steps to prevent the spread of viral, bacterial and other types of infections may help to reduce the risk. Measures to prevent myocarditis include: 20 Staying home when ill and avoiding exercise and other physical exertion Washing hands regularly Taking precautions when traveling Diphtheria immunization may prevent diphtheria-related myocarditis. 15 Avoiding the use of illicit drugs, excessive use of alcohol and exposure to poisonous substances may also lower the risk of developing myocarditis.",

Pericarditis, on the other hand, is an inflammation of the pericardium - two thin layers of sac-like tissue that surround the heart. Myocarditis and pericarditis are two separate heart conditions. 21 Read more about Pericarditis » Q: Myocarditis vs. endocarditis - what is the difference? A: Myocarditis is the name for inflammation of the heart muscle, which is called the myocardium. Endocarditis on the other hand refers to a rare infection of the inner lining of the heart, which is called the endocardium, as well as the heart valves. Myocarditis and endocarditis are two distinct heart conditions. Read more about Endocarditis » Q: Can myocarditis come back? A: Yes, myocarditis can recur. If myocarditis recurs, this can sometimes lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Recurrence is not very common; it is estimated to occur in 10-15 percent of people who have experienced myocarditis. 2 22 Q: Can myocarditis cause a heart attack or heart failure ? A: In severe cases, myocarditis can lead to heart failure or stroke , though it is unlikely to lead to a heart attack. Myocarditis can cause the heart muscle to become damaged and weak, rendering it unable to pump blood around the body properly . This can lead to heart failure. A clot may form in the weakened heart, possibly leading to a stroke. 20 If myocarditis is suspected, it is very important to consult a doctor without delay. Q: Can children get myocarditis? A: Yes, children and infants can get myocarditis. However, pediatric myocarditis is uncommon. Myocarditis in children is typically acute or fulminant (severe and rapid in onset) and may be a cause of sudden death. The most common cause of myocarditis in children is a viral infection. 23"

These microorganisms are common and frequently they can be found in the mouth of healthy people. When the immune system is competent and working properly it is able to control these microorganisms so that they don’t cause the disease. People with weakened or suppressed immune system, instead, are not able to control the infection, so that the disease can occur. Q: How is necrotizing periodontitis treated? A: Treatment of necrotizing periodontitis involves use of antiseptic mouth rinses or antibiotics and other oral hygiene measures. It is advised to brush teeth twice a day and regularly visit a dentist for oral health check-ups. In severe cases a surgery might be needed. Q: What is noma disease? A: noma disease is a serious infection of the mouth and face. It can be a sequel of necrotizing periodontal disease. Most commonly affects malnourished children in less developed countries. The infection causes rapid damages to mouth and face tissues and can lead to severe face disfiguration."

    "what_is_neonatal_jaundice": "Neonatal jaundice – otherwise known as neonatal hyperbilirubinemia – is a common and usually harmless condition that turns the skin and other parts of a newborn baby’s body yellow in color. 1 Jaundice is often found among newborn babies. In fact, it is the most common disorder for which newborns receive medical attention and/or are (re)admitted to hospital. The condition is caused by excessive levels of the chemical compound bilirubin in the tissues of the body. Although neonatal jaundice is normally a non-serious condition, babies experiencing the disorder should always be seen by a doctor or midwife, who will be able to advise on a method of treatment where necessary. In very rare cases, when the levels of bilirubin are very high, serious complications are possible. 1",
    "symptoms": "The main symptom of neonatal jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and other parts of the body. As the condition progresses, the whites of the eyes may take on a yellow tinge. Symptoms will typically begin in the region of the face and gradually progress down the body to the legs. This progression may be unidentifiable in some cases, with the discoloration appearing to occur across the whole body all at once. If there is any doubt about skin discoloration, possible in babies with dark skin, this can be checked by pressing a finger down on the skin. In cases of jaundice, the skin should appear yellow when the finger is released. 2 Signs that neonatal jaundice is worsening include: Yellow skin below the knee Yellow skin becoming more intense in colour Difficulty feeding the baby Difficulty waking the baby Irritability The baby arching his/her neck or body backwards. If any of these signs occur, immediate medical attention should be sought. If you are concerned that a child you care for has neonatal jaundice, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.",
    "causes": "Neonatal jaundice is caused by a buildup of the chemical compound bilirubin in the blood. Normally, the liver breaks down bilirubin and disposes of it through urine and stool. If bilirubin is produced faster than it can be broken down, jaundice occurs. Newborns process bilirubin more slowly than adults, because their liver and intestines are not yet completely mature. The breakdown of red blood cells in infants can be related to: 1 2 Bruising or mild injury to the newborn during delivery. An incompatibility between the mother’s blood type and that of the baby, which may cause the mother’s immune system to attack the baby’s red blood cells. Hereditary causes of red blood cell breakdown, such as a deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD). This is more common among people of an African-American, Asian or Mediterranean ancestry. Asian ancestry. In Asians, the ability to remove bilirubin takes longer to develop. A slight increase in the breakdown of red blood cells, combined with a liver that is not functioning very well, can therefore lead to jaundice. 1 Generally, bilirubin production slows down significantly a few weeks after birth, once the liver and intestines are fully developed. ref1 2\n\nPhysiological jaundice is the most common form of the condition and is largely harmless. It usually begins two days after birth, reaches its peak at four days and disappears after seven to ten days. This type of neonatal jaundice is caused by a mild accumulation of bilirubin.\n\nJaundice in infants is classified as prolonged jaundice if symptoms persist for 14 days or longer after birth; this can be 21 days in premature babies. 3 The condition is usually caused by breastfeeding (see FAQs below), but may indicate a more serious problem. A doctor will be able to identify the cause behind prolonged jaundice and recommend treatment.\n\nNeonatal jaundice will usually disappear after the liver has had time to fully develop and red blood cell breakdown has naturally slowed. If this does not happen, it may be that the condition is being caused by other factors. Additional signs that this is the case may include: The baby is unwell, e.g. not feeding well or unusually irritable or appears a lot quieter than usual Symptoms of jaundice are present in the first 24 hours after birth Symptoms of jaundice are still present two weeks after birth The baby has pale, chalky stools The baby has urine that causes dark stains on the nappy. These symptoms may indicate that the baby has more severe hyperbilirubinemia, and in these cases it will be especially important to seek medical attention without delay. Factors that may cause a more serious form of neonatal jaundice include blood or liver conditions, as well as blood type incompatibility with the mother. When a baby and mother have incompatible blood types, the mother’s blood can destroy red blood cells in the baby and cause jaundice.",
    "diagnosing_neonatal_jaundice": "Babies are checked for neonatal jaundice as part of the routine medical examination which typically takes place within 72 hours of birth. As the condition can take up to one week to appear, the baby should also be checked frequently after being taken home. Parents should monitor for yellowing of the skin and eyes, as well as for bright yellow urine and abnormally pale stool. If jaundice is suspected, parents should contact a doctor or midwife who will then usually recommend a bilirubin test. 4\n\nIf jaundice is suspected, a test to measure the levels of bilirubin in the blood will usually be carried out. This will either be done using an instrument known as a bilirubinometer, which uses light to test for bilirubin, or through a blood test. A blood test is generally only used if symptoms appear within 24 hours of birth or if the results from the bilirubinometer show particularly high levels. The results of a bilirubin test will be used to decide on an appropriate treatment route for the condition.",
    "neonatal_jaundice_treatment": "Treatment for neonatal jaundice is aimed at reducing the levels of bilirubin in the blood. In mild cases, no treatment at all may be required other than monitoring the child, making sure that the jaundice improves. In other cases, treatment may be necessary and options include:\n\nPhototherapy is the most common treatment option for babies with jaundice and is in the majority of cases the only treatment method that is necessary for recovery. Phototherapy involves exposing the baby’s skin to special blue light, which is able to break down bilirubin into a harmless substance. For the best results, the baby should be exposed to the light for as long as possible. This will usually take place at the hospital, but in some cases may be possible to do it at home. Generally, phototherapy is very safe, though the infant’s eyes will need to be protected from the light, and temporary side-effects such as dehydration, a skin rash and loose stool may result. These are all treatable.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment is used for the treatment of blood group, Rhesus (Rh), ABO and other blood group incompatibilities. It is believed to reduce the need for exchange transfusions. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may not be very helpful for babies that are already immunized, but it has been shown to be beneficial to babies that would otherwise need an exchange transfusion. The reasons behind this are not completely understood. In some cases, it may be necessary to try IVIG preparations from various manufacturers if the initial treatment does not work. Generally, IVIG preparations are infused intravenously over a period of a few hours. The process can be repeated, and combined with phototherapy.\n\nIn emergency situations, when very high levels of bilirubin need to be reduced quickly, an exchange transfusion may be required. This is a procedure in which some of the baby’s blood is replaced with donor blood. This can be effective in bringing down bilirubin levels quickly.",
    "complications": "In the majority of cases, neonatal jaundice is a harmless condition that leads to no serious complications. However, serious complications which can lead to both temporary and permanent disability can occur, albeit rarely. A possible, but overall rare complication of neonatal jaundice is (acute) bilirubin encephalopathy, which may sometimes be termed kernicterus; this more likely affects premature babies or – in a minority of cases – babies with very high bilirubin levels. Signs of bilirubin encephalopathy may include: 5 6 Severe jaundice within the first few days of birth Difficulty feeding High-pitched cry Arched neck or back. Treating kernicterus usually involves phototherapy or, in emergency situations, an exchange transfusion. If kernicterus is not detected and treated early, it can cause long-term damage, including a certain form of cerebral palsy (athetoid cerebral palsy), sensory disability and, in rare cases, mortality.",
    "neonatal_jaundice_faqs": "Q: Can breastfeeding cause neonatal jaundice? A: Neonatal jaundice is most common in infants who are breastfed. There are two main mechanisms behind breastfeeding-related jaundice. In breastfeeding jaundice, which occurs within one week of birth, the problem is that the baby is not getting sufficient breast milk. This leads to low calorie intake and to inadequate numbers of bowel movements, which means that bilirubin is not removed from the body. It therefore recirculates in the intestines, where more bilirubin is absorbed. Treatment for breastfeeding jaundice is with rehydration, i.e. making sure the baby receives adequate fluids, and increased breastfeeding sessions. In breast milk jaundice, which occurs within two weeks of birth and can last for between four and 13 weeks, the cause is an interplay between a substance in breast milk and the baby’s digestive tract. Increased level of beta-glucuronidase in the mother’s breast milk, combined with a low population of gut bacteria in the baby’s digestive tract, causes the bilirubin in the infant’s body to be re-absorbed and thus stay in the body. This causes jaundice to persist. Treatment is by continued breastfeeding, supplemented with formula feeding. Phototherapy can be used in addition if necessary. Jaundice should not be considered a reason to cease breastfeeding a baby, however, as long as the baby is feeding adequately and gaining weight. Q: How can neonatal jaundice be prevented? A: Although neonatal jaundice is a very common problem among newborn babies, there are ways to reduce the chance of it developing. The key mechanism is to prevent bilirubin from remaining in the body, and this is done by: 7 Frequent breastfeeding with adequate amounts of breast milk increases the infant’s gut motility (how often the gut moves) and frequency of bowel movements, which result in greater removal of bilirubin from the body and consequently less risk of jaundice. Protein-rich feeds, whether through special formula or breast milk. These inhibit jaundice by preventing bilirubin being reabsorbed and recirculated by the body. In dehydrated babies, rehydrating with a protein-rich feeding solution rather than with glucose or water."

    "condition": "Nephritic Syndrome",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/nephritic-syndrome/",
    "what_is_nephritic_syndrome": "Nephritic syndrome is the name given to a collection of different signs and symptoms that occur as a result of inflammation in the kidneys. This inflammation causes the kidneys to work less effectively. It also causes protein and red blood cells to leak from the bloodstream into the urine. There are many conditions that may cause nephritic syndrome, and it can occur in people of all ages. Common causes are infections, immune system disorders and inflammation of the blood vessels. The main symptoms are passing less urine than normal, leading to a fluid buildup in the body, and having blood in the urine. People with nephritic syndrome also often develop high blood pressure . Treatment depends on the underlying cause, but usually involves managing the high blood pressure and reducing the inflammation in the kidneys. Although many people recover well from nephritic syndrome, some people may go on to develop renal failure. The risk of renal failure depends on the severity of the syndrome and its underlying cause. Nephritic syndrome is not a disease but a syndrome. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often and predictably occur together, and which develop as a result of another condition. Syndromes are not necessarily specific to any disease or disorder. Nephritic syndrome has many potential triggers, therefore, successfully treating it involves identifying the underlying cause. 1 Nephritic syndrome has both acute and chronic forms. Acute, or rapidly-progressing, nephritic syndrome usually comes on suddenly and, because of acute and painful symptoms, seldom goes undetected. Chronic nephritic syndrome typically progresses slowly and often goes undetected for some time. 2 Chronic inflammation of the kidneys can cause scarring, which may negatively impact kidney function and lead to high blood pressure and, eventually, if left undiagnosed and untreated, to a need for dialysis (renal replacement therapy, when a dialysis machine replaces the kidneys’ function and filters waste products from the blood), and possibly kidney transplantation. 3",
    "what_causes_nephritic_syndrome": "Nephritic syndrome is the result of inflammation affecting small groups of blood vessels, known as glomeruli, in the kidneys. As the glomeruli are the kidneys’ main filter units, this inflammation disrupts the kidneys’ ability to adequately filter blood. The inflammation can originate in the kidneys themselves or be the result of infection or injury elsewhere in the body. 2 It can occur in people of any age, including children. Nephritic syndrome can develop as a result of any of the following: 1 4 Primary glomerular diseases: Such as IgA nephropathy (Berger’s disease) or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy is a very common cause of nephritic syndrome. 5 Bacterial infections: Such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), pneumococcal pneumonia , typhoid , infective endocarditis , or secondary syphilis . Nephritic syndrome following a streptococcal throat infection is fairly common, especially in children. Viral infections: Such as hepatitis B, mumps , measles , chickenpox or glandular fever (mononucleosis). Multisystem systemic/inflammatory diseases: Such as vasculitis, Goodpasture’s Syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, or lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus). Abdominal abscess: A pocket of infected fluid and pus inside the abdominal cavity. This can be located on or near any organ. Parasitic infections: Such as malaria . As there are many underlying conditions for nephritic syndrome, there are different risk factors, such as recent infections, immune system disorders and genetic disorders. See the sections below for more information on the relationship between nephritic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, and nephritic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. If you are concerned that you or someone you know may be experiencing nephritic syndrome, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.",
    "nephritic_syndrome_symptoms": "Typical symptoms include passing less urine than normal, having blood in the urine and swelling of the feet or face (edema). Other possible symptoms are flank pain, back pain, headache, shortness of breath and symptoms related to the underlying cause, for example a skin rash and joint pain. The symptoms of nephritic syndrome differ, depending on whether the acute or chronic form of the syndrome is present. Symptoms of acute nephritic syndrome include: 1 2 4 Edema in the face and legs: Edema is the accumulation of fluids in the body, usually under the skin, leading to a puffy appearance. Low urine volume: Known as oliguria, this is defined as less than 500ml of urine being produced in a 24-hour period. Hematuria: Blood in the urine which often, but not necessarily, leads to red discoloration. There are two types of hematuria: microhematuria, which indicates unseen blood, and macrohematuria, in which the blood is visible to the eye. High blood pressure: Hypertension, which results from the disruption of kidney function, may also occur. High blood pressure is generally defined as a resting blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher in adults, 6 . In children, what constitutes hypertension depends on the age and size of the child. Fever, weakness and fatigue Appetite loss, vomiting and abdominal pain Malaise (a feeling of general unwellness) and nausea may also be present. Chronic nephritic syndrome usually presents with fairly mild or even undetectable symptoms, which can include: 2 Edema Hypertension/high blood pressure Kidney failure in later stages Symptoms of kidney failure can include: Itchy skin and/or rash Decreased appetite Nausea Vomiting Fatigue Difficulty breathing In both chronic and acute nephritic syndrome, the urine will usually contain high concentrations of red blood cells, as the blood cells leak out of the damaged glomeruli. If you are concerned that you or someone you love may have nephritic syndrome, you can consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",
    "diagnosing_nephritic_syndrome": "The diagnosis of nephritic syndrome is typically based on a physical examination of the person and analysis of their urine (urinalysis). People with nephritic syndrome tend to have high blood pressure, so a doctor will check this. A doctor will also look for signs of: Abnormalities, such as dark color or cloudiness in the urine Protein in the urine (proteinuria), which may indicate nephrotic syndrome Uremia, an excess of urea or creatinine in the blood, or azotemia, an excess of nitrogen-rich waste compounds in the blood Increased fluid volume in the body, which may lead to edema Reduced filtration in the kidneys, specifically the glomeruli A kidney biopsy (tissue sample from the kidney) may be performed to investigate the cause of the nephritic syndrome.\n\nBecause nephritic syndrome is a cluster of symptoms rather than a disease in itself, much of the testing that makes up the diagnosis is aimed at determining what the underlying cause is. Another important element in diagnosis is differential diagnosis, as the illness may be nephrosis rather than nephritis. In examining a person with potential nephritic syndrome, a doctor might carry out the following tests: 1 Take patient history: A doctor will ask the affected person about the time at which their symptoms began and attempt to determine the point at which the kidneys began to excrete protein into the urine. Check appearance and colour of urine: Urine that is dark in colour may be very concentrated and contain blood. Blood pressure: Hypertension can be a sign of disrupted kidney function. Edema assessment: Edema, or fluid gathering in the tissues, can be a sign that there is not enough protein in the blood and may suggest proteinuria. Urine dipstick test: A simple form of urinalysis that is used as a quick test for blood and protein in the urine. They will use a dipstick test, in which a test-strip of paper is immersed in a urine sample, to check for blood and protein in the urine Urinalysis: A urine sample will be sent to a laboratory to do a precise check for protein levels and red blood cells. Blood tests: To check levels of electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, immunoglobulins, antibodies, and other substances. Kidney biopsy: This relatively straightforward procedure may be performed as an outpatient procedure or after hospital admission, depending on the patient’s particular circumstances. It uses only local anesthetic and is done using ultrasound and specialized biopsy needles to remove a small sample of tissue. Kidney biopsies are a very reliable way of distinguishing chronic glomerulonephritis from other, similar, disorders. 2",
    "treatment": "Treatment depends on the underlying causes. Medications (such as ramipril, benazepril, candesartan, or valsartan) are typically used to treat the high blood pressure. Medications will also be administered to reduce inflammation in the kidneys. Generally, doctors will recommend: 1 Bed rest A diet that is restricted in salt, potassium and fluid Medication to control blood pressure, if necessary Medication to reduce inflammation Medication to remove fluids from the body Dialysis to replace kidney function in severe cases The time it takes to recover from nephritic syndrome varies according to its severity and the underlying cause.  Most patients begin to feel better fairly soon, especially if treatment is prompt.",
    "nephritic_syndrome_and_other_kidney_disorders": "Kidney disorders are complex and may not be entirely distinguishable from one another without extensive testing. The terminology can also be hard to grasp. Some associated conditions include: 2 7 Nephrotic syndrome Acute nephritis Acute glomerulonephritis Rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis Chronic glomerular disease Lupus nephritis\n\nBoth nephritis and nephrosis are among the body’s responses to injury or illness affecting the kidneys. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by severe proteinuria, i.e. high amounts of protein, including albumin, in the urine, while nephritic syndrome’s major feature is inflammation. Depending on the specific underlying conditions of the two, nephrotic syndrome often is the more serious. 8 In both cases, medical care should be sought as a matter of urgency. Doctors will usually need to order tests to determine whether a patient has nephritic or nephrotic syndrome. ref8 7 9\n\nGlomerulonephritis refers to a number of kidney problems that involve inflammation in the glomeruli, which are the kidney’s filtration units. Acute glomerulonephritis can cause nephritic syndrome. Glomerulonephritis can be acute (sudden onset, lasting for a short time) or chronic (long-lasting), and it can result from a variety of factors, such as: 10 Infections, especially those involving streptococcal bacteria Autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (see below) Hereditary factors Edema, hematuria and hypertension are known as the nephritic triad. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) generally, and rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis (RPG) occasionally result from infections. 11 12 The symptoms of acute glomerulonephritis resemble those of acute nephritic syndrome, and include: 13 14 Edema, often showing first as facial puffiness in the morning Hematuria: blood in the urine, which can color it pink, red or brown Oliguria: producing less urine than usual Hypertension: high blood pressure Fatigue: feeling tired, weak and/or exhausted (almost) constantly Edema can also cause shortness of breath and coughing. If you are concerned that you or someone you know may be experiencing nephritic syndrome, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nPost-infectious glomerulonephritis is a common cause of acute glomerulonephritis, especially among children. It can be caused by a wide range of conditions and factors, including viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus infection, the flu or Hepatitis B, and bacterial infections such as staphylococcal, pneumococcal and streptococcal infections. It commonly occurs after streptococcal infections. 15 Some conditions that can increase a person’s risk of developing post-infectious glomerulonephritis are for example: 11 15 Sore throat, usually pharyngitis (cobblestone throat) Skin infections Diabetes Alcoholism Malignancies such as cancer or leukemia Heart-valve replacement surgery HIV infection Intravenous drug use In acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis, the symptoms typically appear some weeks after the infection that triggered it has cleared up. This is typically within one to two weeks after pharyngitis or up to a month after a skin infection. If symptoms appear within a few days, however, it is possible that there are existing renal problems. 11 Symptoms of acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis include the nephritic triad: 12 13 14 Hematuria, causing red, pink, brown or cola-colored urine Edema, causing facial puffiness and swelling in the legs and arms Hypertension, or high blood pressure Oliguria, or reduced urine output, is less common, occurring in less than half of cases. Urinalysis can confirm hematuria even if no blood is visible in the urine; in this case it is called microscopic hematuria. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) usually follows an infection, typically a streptococcal infection of the throat or skin, but also may result from mild infections that follow other illnesses or surgical procedures. APSGN is a post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most commonly found among children between the ages of four and 12, although it is also becoming more common among people who are older than 50. 14 It is more common among men than women. The prognosis for children with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis is good, though it can be less positive for older people. Certain debilitating conditions may also cause the prognosis to be more serious. These include: Malnutrition Alcoholism Diabetes Chronic illnesses HIV infection Intravenous drug use Cancer If symptoms are severe or one of the above risk factors is present, a nephrologist or pediatric nephrologist may need to be consulted additionally to a GP. Because the condition is generally already healing by the time symptoms become apparent, this form of glomerulonephritis is usually treated by managing the symptoms and supporting recovery. This includes managing the edema and hypertension, and supporting kidney function. Any medication that is administered will be aimed at reducing hypertension and helping kidney function to return to usual. (See the section on treatment of nephritic syndrome above for more information.) Good to know: Rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is another form of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, but it may also occur for reasons not connected to an  infection; post-infection RPGN is only one type of RPGN. Post-infection RPGN often occurs in the month following a bout of flu-like symptoms. The exact symptoms of rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis depend on what underlying condition causes it, but may include: 12 16 Weakness Fatigue Fever Nausea and vomiting Appetite loss and therefore unintended weight loss Joint pain Muscle pain Painful skin lesions Abdominal pain Nausea and vomiting Edema Low urine production Treatment for rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis must be sought as quickly as possible. The disorder can cause damage before it becomes symptomatic, so the long-term prognosis depends on a rapid response once symptoms are apparent. Rarely, a case of rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis involving the lungs may occur. This is called pulmonary-renal syndrome. People with this condition may also, in addition to having the above-mentioned renal symptoms, cough up blood. This combination of coughing up blood and renal symptoms is an emergency that may lead to kidney and lung failure. Urgent medical treatment should be sought without delay. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have a post-infection kidney problem, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus , often known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease that can affect any of the body’s systems. 17 Lupus mostly affects women. Lupus affecting the kidneys is known as lupus nephritis, a kind of inflammation of the kidneys. About half of all people with lupus are affected by lupus nephritis. In children with lupus, about eight out of ten will have lupus nephritis. 18 In lupus nephritis, inflammation inside the kidney causes glomerulonephritis and therefore nephritic syndrome. 19 In the early stages of this disorder and sometimes even later, there may be no symptoms of anything being wrong with the kidneys, although lupus nephritis may be diagnosed using urine tests and kidney biopsy at any time. 17 Lab tests in people with lupus nephritis show proteinuria and hematuria, even if they are asymptomatic. Symptoms of lupus nephritis include: 18 20 19 Edema: puffiness or swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, hands, face and eyelids Foamy or red, brown, or pink urine Weight gain Joint pain or swelling in the joints Headache Dizziness Blood clotting problems Hypertension (high blood pressure) Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria, or protein in the urine. Pink, red or brown urine is a sign of hematuria, i.e. blood in the urine. Muscle pain and a butterfly rash on the face may also occur, but these are general symptoms of lupus and not specific to lupus nephritis. For more information, see this resource on lupus. Good to know: Lupus itself often affects the kidneys, but does not cause kidney infections in the same way that something like a urinary tract infection may. While lupus nephritis is not itself a kidney infection, meaning it is not caused by bacteria, viruses or other infectious causes, medications used to treat lupus can suppress the immune system, potentially leading to an increased risk of infections of the kidneys. 19 If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have lupus or a kidney problem, consult the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.\n\nDiagnosis of lupus nephritis involves urine and blood tests and often  a kidney biopsy. Urine tests are used to measure the levels of protein, red blood cells and creatinine in the urine. High levels of creatinine indicate that the kidneys are not filtering wastes out of the blood very well. The same is true of high levels of protein in the urine. High levels of protein in the urine also may indicate that nephrotic syndrome is present. 18 A blood urea nitrogen, or BUN, test may also be done using a blood sample taken from a vein. This test will also be an indication of how compromised the filtering capabilities of the kidneys are. 21 A kidney biopsy, which is an outpatient procedure, will confirm the presence of lupus nephritis and determine how badly the kidneys are affected. In a kidney biopsy, a needle is used to take a small sample of kidney tissue, which will be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\n\nLupus nephritis is usually treated using medication to reduce inflammation, decrease the severity of the body’s auto-immune response and prevent the body from attacking the kidneys. Commonly-used medications include: 22 23 Corticosteroids Hydroxychloroquine Cyclophosphamide Mycophenolic acid Azathioprine Managing the hypertension that accompanies nephritic syndrome in glomerulonephritis also requires medication, which can include: 18 24 ACE inhibitors Other Diuretics Beta-blockers Calcium-channel blockers The goal of treatment for lupus nephritis is to support kidney function and keep it as normal as possible, while preventing it from becoming worse. 20 Treatment for lupus nephritis works well, so the prognosis is generally good. However, lupus nephritis can cause kidney function to decline as time goes by, and between 10-30 percent of people with lupus nephritis may develop kidney failure. 18 Very severe lupus nephritis may cause diffuse proliferative nephritis, which causes scarring to accumulate in the kidneys. This scarring causes kidney function to decline or, in the worst case, even fail.",
    "nephritic_syndrome_faqs": "Q: Is nephritic syndrome dangerous during pregnancy? A: Nephritic syndrome indicates a problem with the kidneys, which is of great concern for pregnant people , whose kidneys and other internal organs are already adapting to pregnancy and thus under increased demand. A doctor should be consulted without delay if symptoms occur. Acute nephritic syndrome poses certain health risks to both mother and baby. Chronic nephritic syndrome, though rarer, is also of concern. If nephrotic syndrome occurs, complications for both mother and baby may occur, even if renal function isn’t badly affected. Mothers may experience postnatal problems, such as edema, urinary tract infections and anemia. 26 A doctor should be consulted as soon as possible. Q: Can I take painkillers if I have or have had nephritic syndrome? A: There is some evidence that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can worsen existing kidney damage or lead to kidney damage if used in high amounts exceeding the standard dosages over time. Normal dosages, when taken only as directed, are safe. 27 NSAIDs include diclofenac , celecoxib, etoricoxib, indometacin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, high-dose aspirin (above 300mg per dose), mefenamic acid, and naproxen. 28 High doses of NSAIDs over time can lead to chronic interstitial nephritis. Patients with kidney problems should use NSAIDs only under the direct supervision of a doctor. Opioids such as morphine, hydrocodone or oxycodone, should generally be avoided, except in post-surgical or severe long-term pain, and would not ordinarily be prescribed by physicians due to their addictive properties. Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is generally a safe painkiller for use by people with kidney problems or suspected kidney problems. However, overuse of acetaminophen can lead to liver damage. Acetaminophen reduces pain and fever, but is not an anti-inflammatory. 29 However, all patients should consult a doctor before taking NSAIDs or any other painkillers."

    "what_is_nephrolithiasis_kidney_stones": "Kidney stones, or nephrolithiasis, is a common condition in which hard collections, or calculi, form in the renal system, usually in the tube between the kidney and the bladder. These collections are the result of urine becoming saturated with minerals such as calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, struvite, uric acid or cystine. 1 Common types of stone are: 2 3 Calcium oxalate stones Calcium phosphate stones Uric acid stones Struvite stones Cystine stones Around 80 percent of all kidney stones, also called calculi, are calcium stones. 4 These stones can vary in size from a few millimeters to a large staghorn shape a few centimeters in length.[1] Kidney calculi are more common in men than in women, and tend to occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 50. People between the ages of 35 and 45 are the most likely to be affected, but the disease can affect people of any age. It is rare to develop a stone for the first time over the age of 50. 5 Over half a million people in the US are affected by kidney stones every year. ref4 Kidney stones are more common in whites and Asians than in people with African, Native American or African-American heritage. 3 Symptoms occur when a stone leaves the kidney and enters the tighter ureter, the tube between the kidney and bladder, on its way to the bladder. A stone that is moving is much more painful than a stone that has not moved from its original place. 4 Typical symptoms are severe pain in the back and belly, difficulty urinating and red or brown urine. Common treatment methods include good hydration, pain relief and anti-emetics. About 20% of patients require procedures such as  lithotripsy, breaking up the calculus with shock waves, to remove the stones, when kidney stones have caused pain, infection or obstruction. Most people recover fully, without any complications.",

Try a free Ada symptom assessment now .\n\nMen and women experience the symptoms of kidney stones in much the same way. However, men may experience the pain from a kidney stone slightly differently. In men, the pain from a kidney stone may radiate into the groin or the testicles. However, this does not mean that the stone is present in the testicles or in the groin. The general symptoms of pain, nausea, fever, cloudy or bad-smelling urine, bloody urine, lack of urine or urinary retention, and stones or gravel in the urine will be experienced in the same way in men and women.\n\nPain is one of the most obvious symptoms of kidney stone obstructions. Where the pain is felt, and where it radiates to in the body, can indicate where the calculus is within the renal system. The pain that accompanies a kidney stone is felt acutely in the flank (the side) and radiates down the groin on the same side. Not all stones cause pain that spreads. Some stones may cause no pain at all. Pain is caused not directly by the kidney stone itself, but instead it results from the effect that the stone has on the body by leading to muscle spasms, inflammation and irritation at and around the site of the obstruction. 5 Factors that influence how painful the kidney stone is, include: 4 Whether the stone is moving Whether it is twisted or tilted in the ureter or urethra Whether the obstruction is complete or partial Where exactly it is in the renal system How big the stone is Good to know: Pain from kidney stones is often described as excruciating and intermittent, and often occurs in cycles that last between 20 minutes and an hour. People with painful kidney stones often cannot keep still because of the pain. They are often ashen, pale and sweaty, with a tender abdomen. 6 If you are concerned that you or someone you care for may have kidney stones, Ada is ready to start your free symptom assessment at any time.",
    "risk_factors_and_causes": "Kidney stones are more common in men, and in adults between 20 and 50 years of age, but very rare in children. It is most common in adults who have a low fluid intake and consequently produce little urine, which can contain high amounts of stone-forming substances. 7 Kidney stones are also more common in people who have gout (in the case of uric acid stones), or who have a family member who also suffers from kidney stones. The genes that can increase a person’s chance of developing nephrolithiasis have been identified. 7 Infections of the urinary tract may lead to kidney stones. Other general risk factors are dehydration and being overweight or obese. Other risk factors include: 1 5 8 9 Anatomical abnormalities such as horseshoe kidney or ureteral stricture Hyperparathyroidism, i.e. an overactive parathyroid gland Metabolic disorders, such as hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria or chronic metabolic acidosis Intestinal problems such as Crohn’s Disease Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery), such as a sleeve gastrectomy or a gastric bypass Living in a hot climate  and its risk of dehydration Too much exercise and its risk of dehydration Too little exercise and its risk of obesity A diet high in protein, salt or sugar, especially fructose and sucrose Some medications can increase the risk of forming kidney stones. These include among others: 4 Indinavir, an antiretroviral medication Atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication Guaifenesin, an expectorant medication Triamterene, a medication used for the treatment of hypertension and edema Silicate, which is used in antacids Sulfasalazine, a medication used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, colitis and Crohn's disease Sulfadiazine, a drug used for the treatment of otitis media ear infections Ceftriaxone, a drug used for the treatment of bacterial infections Stones caused by struvite, as opposed to calcium, are caused by urea-splitting bacteria such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Proteus species, and indicate an underlying urinary tract infection . Struvite stones are more common in women than in men, 3 and are responsible for between 1 and 5 percent percent of kidney stones. 1 They will reoccur if the underlying UTI is not treated. 6 Kidney stones caused by uric acid are associated with acidic urine, usually with a pH of below 5.5. 4 These account for only around 10% percent of stones and are often associated with gout. Chemotherapy for conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma, as well as these conditions themselves, which increase tissue breakdown, may also lead to the urine becoming more acidic. If you are experiencing symptoms such as those listed above, and are concerned that the cause may be kidney stones, try a free Ada symptom assessment .\n\nIt is generally thought that certain foods can increase risk of developing some kinds of kidney stones. These include animal protein from meats or fish, in the case of uric acid stones, and some vegetables, drinks and nuts in the case of calcium oxalate stones. 5 4 Excessive salt and excessive sucrose and fructose intake have in some studies also been shown to overall increase the risk of stones forming, and should therefore be avoided in excess and only consumed in moderation.\n\nPeople who have had calcium oxalate stones in the past or who have a high rate of oxalate excretion should reduce consumption of certain foods and food types, including: 10 Rhubarb Spinach Cocoa Tea Nuts Vitamin C\n\nHigh intake of purine in the diet causes the body to produce large amounts of monosodium urate. The risk of developing uric acid stones has a hereditary component in some people, meaning it tends to run in the family. 5 People with uric acid stone disease or hyperuricosuric calcium oxalate stones should reduce consumption of: 10 Calf thymus Liver Kidneys Poultry skin Herrings with skin Anchovies Sprats\n\nThere is some evidence that a predisposition to developing  certain types of kidney stones may, at least partly, be hereditary. 11 Risk factors, such as high levels of uric acid in the blood and high levels of calcium in the urine, for example, may be influenced by genetic factors. 12 Cystine stones are rare and may be caused by genetic factors 5 that cause the body to reabsorb cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine from the kidneys. In cases where cystine stones develop, the urine is saturated to above a certain level with cystine , causing crystals to be deposited and stones to form. 4",
    "diagnosing_kidney_stones": "Diagnosis of kidney stones is often based on the typical symptoms and physical examination. A urine dipstick test may show blood and pus in the urine, and help confirm the presence of a kidney stone. A person being examined for kidney stones will be asked about their medical history and will be physically examined. They will also be given a computerised tomography (CT) scan. X-rays and ultrasound tests can determine the presence of stones, but CT scans are preferred during the diagnostic process, because they can determine the size and location of the stone. MRI scans are not generally helpful. 6 In pregnant women; a kidney ultrasound is usually ordered. An ultrasound of the kidneys and ureters is also often used to diagnose kidney stones in children, although in some cases a CT scan may also be needed. 13 The overall health of the kidneys may be tested using: 2 4 24-hour urine collection test, once the patient is free of stones,  to measure changes in the values for urinary electrolytes, reduced urine volume and to determine the underlying metabolic cause for nephrolithiasis Blood tests, if the person is feverish and may have an infection The calculus/kidney stone will be analysed after it has been passed in the urine or extracted during surgery. 6 People with the following conditions may need further tests, as determined by their physicians: 6 Sarcoidosis Myeloma Bone metastases Solitary kidney Urinary tract anomalies",
    "treatment": "The treatment of kidney stones varies depending  on the size of the kidney stone and the severity of the symptoms. Small stones usually pass with no need for medical assistance. Drinking plenty of water may help to flush the stone from the urinary system. Pain medication is often needed while passing a renal calculus. In severe cases, opiates may be prescribed. However, in most cases, acetaminophen/paracetamol is usually sufficient. 1 5 80 percent of stones pass without serious medical intervention and needing no inpatient treatment. About 20 percent lead to situations that require hospitalization. 4 People may need to be admitted to hospital if the following factors are present: 1 Anuria, when the kidneys do not produce urine Fever Persistent or severe pain Inadequate fluid intake as a result of nausea or vomiting, resulting in dehydration Poor social support while they are living alone at home Inability to access follow-up outpatient care Pregnancy Being older than 60 years of age Good to know: If a fever is present, infection may also be present. Because infection can be very serious, the affected person should receive medical treatment as soon as possible. 1 Treatment at home may be possible for most people, because most stones smaller than 5mm pass on their own and do not cause infection or need surgical help to pass. People may be cared for at home if: 1 Their pain has been relieved and can be managed with acetaminophen/paracetamol They can drink fluids They have good social support They have no complications, such as fever or urinary blockage\n\nPainkillers, antiemetics and antidiuretics are commonly used in both inpatient and outpatient treatment of kidney stones. Painkillers, such as morphine may be used to control severe pain; moderate or mild pain can be controlled with acetaminophen or codeine. Antibiotics are only used in cases where an infection has developed. 4 Other medications used to treat uric acid kidney calculi are: 4 Uricosuric agents, which increase the amount of uric acid excreted Alkalinizing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate and potassium citrate\n\nBig stones, with a diameter of more than 10mm and which are lodged in the ureter, might need assistance to pass, especially if they are blocking the passage of urine. Stones with a diameter of less than 10mm that are in the distal ureter and do not have complications such as infection, should be removed if they have not passed on their own within four to six weeks. 14 This can involve lithotripsy (breaking up the stone with shock waves), or the surgical removal of stones, or the removal of the stone with an endoscope, a small tube with a camera and surgical tools. Shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a non-invasive procedure where sound waves are used to break the stones into fragments small enough to pass through the ureter and out of the body through the urethra. If lithotripsy is not used, other endoscopic methods are possible, such as uteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) or percutaneous nephrostomy. In uteroscopic lithotripsy, an endoscope is introduced to the urethra and moves through the bladder into the ureter to the stone’s location. The stone is then removed. In cases where access to the urethra is complicated because of an enlarged prostate , the endoscope will be introduced via a small incision in the bladder. In a percutaneous nephrostomy, an endoscope is introduced via a small incision in the skin of the flank, directly into the kidney. Some very large or complicated stones may need open surgery. Struvite stones must be removed, as they are infectious or infected foreign bodies. The stones will reoccur if the urinary tract infection that underlies their formation is not resolved. 6",
    "preventing_kidney_stones": "Preventing kidney stones from forming involves changing the diet of the affected person and increasing the amount of fluid, preferably clear fluids such as water, that they consume. In all cases, it is important to remain well hydrated, consuming about 2.5 quarts of water each day. 8 It is also important to limit sugar and salt in the diet and to eat a diet high in fruit and vegetables. 5 In cases where the person is overweight, they should lose the excess weight. Good to know: High-animal protein diets and crash diets should be avoided, as they can unbalance the pH and chemical makeup of urine. 5 For more information, see the section on prevention of kidney stones . In calcium oxalate stones, which are the most common kind, prevention measures include diets that are low in salt, sugars and animal protein , 6 and reduced consumption of oxalate-rich foods. 8 People who are concerned about the role their diets may play in the formation of kidney stones, should consult their physicians, specialist nephrologists and/or a dietitian. Good to know: Low-calcium diets are not indicated for the prevention of calcium oxalate stones, as low calcium diets cause oxalate reabsorption to increase. 8 In cases of uric acid stones, allopurinol will be prescribed to prevent high levels of uric acid building up in the blood. Alkalinizing agents may also be prescribed to make urine more alkaline.",

    "faqs": "Q: Do kidney stones recur once they have been treated? A: Yes. People who have had a kidney stone, have a 50 percent chance of developing another stone within five to seven years. 5 Maintaining high fluid intake, as well as making dietary changes and maintaining a healthy weight, can help postpone the recurrence of stones. 4 Q: Can kidney stones cause long-term kidney damage? A: Yes. Complications can occur, in some cases within hours, that can be serious in themselves. These include sepsis and high fever. Struvite stones, as noted above, are the result of an underlying UTI, which could potentially cause long-term damage if left untreated. In some cases, pyelonephritis may result if kidney stone obstructions are left untreated, and renal damage may be permanent. Q: What are the complications of kidney stones? A: Complications include: Recurrent urinary tract infections Urosepsis Acute kidney injury Glomerular damage Chronic kidney disease Q: What is the difference between kidney stones and bladder stones? A: Kidney stones develop in the kidneys and move into the ureter, bladder and urethra. Bladder stones develop in the bladder. Bladder stones make up about 5 percent of all calculi found in the renal system. They are usually the result of foreign bodies, infection and obstruction, and the most common cause of bladder stones is urinary stasis. The majority of bladder stones occur in men who have bladder outflow problems, which cause urine to remain in the bladder after urination. 1 Q: What are some common foods that contain high levels of oxalate and may therefore need to be eaten only in very low amounts or not at all? A: It is best to speak to a physician or dietitian before adding or eliminating foods. Not every case of kidney stones has the same cause, and therefore some of the foods listed below may not be relevant to the disease. Furthermore, this list is not exhaustive. Some fruits, vegetable and processed foods are high in oxalate; oxalate is involved in the formation of the most common kind of stones, calcium oxalate stones. These  foods include rhubarb, spinach, beetroot, avocado, oranges, raspberries, dates, grapefruit and kiwi fruit. Nuts and nut butter may also be best avoided by some people. Bran flakes and potato chips may also be problematic. 15 16 Q: Can coffee, tea or other caffeinated drinks cause kidney stones? A: Coffee and tea, in fact, reduce the risk of developing kidney stones, and this is true of both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and tea. Caffeinated drinks have a somewhat diuretic effect, which has a protective effect, while decaffeinated drinks could possibly have a protective effect due to the antioxidant chemicals they contain. 17 Research has revealed that drinking coffee may have several different possible effects - some contrasting each other - on a person’s likelihood of developing kidney stones. Studies have shown that consuming caffeine actually increases the amount of calcium that is excreted in the urine, which should in fact increase the risk of developing calcium oxalate kidney stones 18 , which are the most common type of kidney stones. However, despite this, consuming coffee generally appears to lower the risk of kidney stones. 19 Q: Can alcohol cause kidney stones? A: Beer and red wine may in fact lower the risk of developing kidney stones. 17 It is not certain whether any other alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, rye, bourbon or vodka  may have a similarly protective effect, and this should therefore not be assumed. However, there are many psychological and physical health risks associated with alcohol consumption, for example, alcohol dependency and liver disease like liver cirrhosis . Q: Can sports/energy drinks or soft drinks cause kidney stones? A: There is some evidence that the degree to which one is consuming soft drinks or sports/energy drinks contributes to increasing one’s risk of developing kidney stones, but this depends on what is used to sweeten the drink. Fructose is a natural sugar used to sweeten soft drinks, fruit punch, and sports drinks and it is associated with the development of gout and kidney stones, as well as obesity. While some studies have shown that fructose consumption has only a limited effect on the excretion of uric acid, 20 fructose has been shown to increase the amount of calcium, oxalate and uric acid that the body excretes in the urine. It is possible that drinking a fructose-sweetened soda once a day increases the risk of developing kidney stones, compared to drinking artificially-sweetened soda or sports drinks. Furthermore, some studies have shown that cola-based soft drinks increase the risk of developing kidney stones more than non-cola sodas. 17 Q: How are gout and kidney stones related? A: Both gout and some kinds of kidney stones can be caused by high levels of uric acid in the body, 21 and there is some evidence that kidney stones and chronic kidney disease are both more common in people who have gout. 22 For more information, see this resource on gout and this resource on podagra (gout affecting the big toe). Q: Can kidney stones develop after bariatric surgery? A: Yes; it is relatively common for someone who has had bariatric surgery to develop kidney stones. Bariatric surgery can help decrease the risk of sleep apnea , hypertension and diabetes in overweight people who have had the surgery, but some types of bariatric surgery do affect the way that the body processes nutrients. 23 It is also possible that the same factors that made bariatric surgery, such as diabetes, necessary in the first place may contribute to the risk of developing kidney stones afterwards. Q: Does a prostatectomy increase your risk of developing kidney stones? A: No. Removal of the prostate does not affect kidney function, and therefore cannot increase your risk of developing kidney stones. Q: Do gallstones and/or gallbladder removal increase your risk of developing kidney stones? A: Kidney stones and gallstones are not directly related, but studies have shown that people who have gallstones may also be at higher risk of developing kidney stones and vice versa. 24 The processes that cause gallstones may be related to the processes that cause kidney stones. However, how nephrolithiasis and cholelethiasis interact isn’t yet well studied or -understood. Q: What color are kidney stones? A: The composition of kidney stones affects what color they are. Because the colors can vary, it is not always possible to correctly identify what kind of stone has caused the problem just by looking at it; in most cases, stones will be sent away for laboratory analysis. However, speaking broadly, the colors stones come in include: 25 26 Calcium oxalate: black or dark brown Calcium phosphate: dirty white or yellowish Uric acid: ranging from yellowish and brownish to red or orange Struvite: dirty white or yellowish Cystine: pinkish or yellowish, often with a grainy outer surface. It is possible to have more than one sort of stone, and it is also possible for stones to be made up of more than one kind of substance."

    "what_is_nephrotic_syndrome": "Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms which indicate that there is a problem with the kidneys. It is a syndrome rather than a disease. A syndrome is a group of symptoms that often occur together and typically develop as a result of another condition or underlying medical problem. There can be various underlying conditions or problems, all of which require specific treatment. It can occur among adults and children, but is more common among children, especially children aged between 18 months and four years. 1 In children under 8 years old, boys are more commonly affected than girls. While the prognosis is usually quite good,  nephrotic syndrome can become severe and even potentially life-threatening, if left untreated. The degree of severity depends on the underlying cause. The major symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include: The excretion of abnormally large amounts of protein, especially albumin, in the urine, known as proteinuria generally and albuminuria specifically Reduced levels of protein in the blood Edema, abnormal accumulations of fluid, causing swelling of the body or parts of it Hypertension (high blood pressure) and thrombotic events (blood clots) may also be present, as might hyperlipidemia, a high level of lipids in the blood. Causes of nephrotic syndrome include kidney damage from nephrotoxic drugs (drugs which are potentially damaging to the kidneys), systemic disorders such as diabetes or lupus, or diseases affecting the kidneys directly, such as glomerulonephritis. 2 In children, most cases of nephrotic syndrome are caused by minimal change disease (MCD). Treating nephrotic syndrome usually involves managing hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as relieving edema and stopping or lessening the loss of protein in the urine. Ways to do this include following a specific diet and taking medication to lower lipid levels and manage hypertension. 3 4 If the nephrotic syndrome is caused by minimal change disease, steroids may be used as part of treatment. 2\n\nNephritic syndrome is an inflammatory kidney disorder that is sometimes confused with nephrotic syndrome during initial diagnosis. However, there are several clear differences that are ddetermined during laboratory testing. While nephritic syndrome is characterised by inflammation and hematuria (blood in urine), nephrotic syndrome is mostly characterised by proteinuria. Of the two, nephrotic syndrome is often the more serious , depending on the underlying cause.  In both cases, medical assistance should be sought out as quickly as possible.",
    "symptoms_and_complications": "Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include: 1 5 6 Appetite loss Malaise, a general feeling of unwellness Frothy urine due to proteinuria Edema; accumulated fluid under the skin, which may appear as weight gain Hyperlipidemia; high cholesterol or other high blood lipid values Hypertension; high blood pressure Hypoalbuminemia and albuminuria, low blood levels and high urine levels of the protein albumin Proteinuria and edema are the two most distinctive symptoms of nephrotic disorder.\n\nIn a healthy kidney, small groupings of capillaries, known as glomeruli , filter the blood. The glomerulus and nearby tube for the removal of byproducts, known as a tubule, together make up a structure called a nephron. 7 In the nephron, the glomerulus filters the blood. Substances needed by the body, such as potassium, protein and phosphorus, return to the blood, while unwanted products pass through a membrane into the tubule.  These unwanted products pass from the tubule to the ureter, to the bladder and are eventually passed out of the body in the urine. If the tubule, glomerulus, or both, become damaged or infected, this filtration system may become unbalanced. Waste products may build up in the body, and necessary substances such as proteins and minerals may be lost, instead of being reabsorbed. 7 In glomerular disorders, such as some of those that lead to nephrotic syndrome, the membrane between the glomerulus and the tubule may lose its ability to prevent protein molecules and red blood cells from passing out into the tubule, for various reasons. 8 Healthy glomeruli allow less than 400mg of protein into urine per day. In nephrotic syndrome, three grams or more of protein pass into the urine and are subsequently lost, causing blood protein levels to fall. 2 Nephrotic range proteinuria is defined as 3 to 3.5 or more grams of protein lost in urine over a twenty-four hour period. 5 This is almost eight times the amount of protein a healthy glomerulus would allow through. This has various effects on the body, as the protein loss causes low levels of blood protein. Because blood protein is vital to the absorption and elimination of extra fluid from the body’s tissues, low levels of protein result in a buildup of fluids in the tissues, known as edema.\n\nIn nephrotic syndrome, the lack of protein leads to a buildup of fluid made up of sodium and water in the tissues. It is usually starting in the face, around the eyes, or in the legs and ankles, but may lead to generalized swelling of the entire body, too. 9 10 It can also lead to fluid build up around the lungs. 11 This is known as pleural effusion , and if this happens, the affected person may experience difficulty breathing and breathlessness . If this is the case a doctor should be consulted urgently . If fluid builds up inside the belly this is called ascites and may be uncomfortable. Ascites can lead to an increased abdominal circumference and a feeling of heaviness and discomfort in the stomach area or the entire belly. While edema is generally not serious most of the time, it can among others cause joint and abdominal pain that are a cause of concern for people affected. If someone is not sure what causes their particular symptoms it is always advisable to see a doctor to get a proper diagnostic work-up..\n\nAscites is a common complication in disorders that involve proteinuria, such as nephrotic syndrome. In ascites, fluid accumulates inside the abdominal cavity, causing the abdomen to distend. 12 Ascites caused by nephrotic syndrome is more common among children than adults. 13 Symptoms of ascites include: ref9 Abdominal pain A swollen abdomen Weight gain Feeling full sooner during meals Shortness of breath Ascites has to be treated by a doctor, and anyone who develops ascites should seek medical help as soon as possible. 12 In nephrotic syndrome, treatment for ascites involves treating the underlying condition. In addition to this, some cases of ascites may need to  be drained using a process called therapeutic paracentesis.\n\nA pleural effusion is the buildup of an unusually large amount of fluid around the lungs between the layers of the pleura, the thin membrane that lines the inside of the chest cavity, and the surface of the lungs. 14 Symptoms of a pleural effusion include: 15 A dry cough Shortness of breath Chest pain Difficulty breathing properly or worsening of shortness of breath while sitting or lying down The treatment of pleural effusion depends on the degree of discomfort it is causing, whether it is obstructing breathing and what is causing it. Treating pleural effusion caused by nephrotic syndrome involves treating the underlying condition, but can also involve draining the fluid in a procedure called thoracentesis. 15 16 If you are concerned that you or someone you know is experiencing ascites or pleural effusion because of nephrotic syndrome, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.",
    "causes": "Nephrotic syndrome is not a disease in itself, but rather a sign that something else is wrong in the body. Underlying conditions that can cause nephrotic syndrome can be primary, originating in the kidneys, or secondary, originating elsewhere in the body. Primary causes include: 1 17 18 Minimal change disease, which can cause proteinuria, mostly found among children Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which causes scarring of the glomeruli Membranous nephropathy, which occurs when the glomeruli become thickened and damaged Secondary causes include: 1 19 20 Diabetic nephropathy, which results from long-term high levels of blood glucose Preeclampsia , a pregnancy complication Amyloidosis , a bone-marrow disorder that causes malformed protein chains, mostly found among older adults HIV-associated nephropathy Some drugs may lead to kidney damage, which may then in some cases lead to nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotoxic drugs that can cause kidney damage in children include: 21 Cyclosporine Aminoglycoside antibiotics Cisplatin Amphotericin B Beta-lactam antibiotics Indomethacin It should be noted that the circumstances in which these drugs can become nephrotoxic vary from case to case and it is always advisable to talk to your doctor if you are worried about medication side effects. Other drugs that can be nephrotoxic include: 22 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Radiocontrast media Antirheumatic drugs Certain anticancer drugs In cases where a certain drug may be causing nephrotic syndrome, stopping using the drug usually improves the symptoms and relieves the syndrome.\n\nGlomerulonephritis is the most common cause for nephrotic syndrome. The two most common subtypes of glomerulonephritis are focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGN) and membranous glomerulonephritis, also known as MGN or membranous nephropathy. FSGN is the most common form of glomerulonephritis among people of African or African-American ancestry, while MGN is the most common among people with European ancestry. There are many other causes for nephrotic syndrome, the most common being diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus . 9 Glomerulonephritis can also be the result of a streptococcal infection. While some cases of glomerulonephritis clear up on their own, others may take longer. In cases where the glomerulonephritis becomes chronic, long-term damage to the kidneys may occur. 23 The various types of glomerulonephritis are characterized by change or damage to the structures of the glomerulus, for example as a result of attack by the body’s own immune system, infection or exposure to toxins. It can lead to nephrotic syndrome, but also to another different syndrome called nephritic syndrome . In most cases of nephrotic syndrome, the underlying condition affects the membrane between the tubule and the glomerulus, which causes the loss of protein into the urine. The causes of the inflammation of the glomeruli that characterises focal segmental glomerulonephritis (FSGN) are not well-understood, but it is suspected that viral infection or exposure to toxins may be at least part of the problem.  In most cases of  membranous nephropathy, the cause for the damage to the glomerular membranes can be considered a result of an autoimmune attack on the glomeruli, leading to the person affected producing antibodies against their own glomerular membrane. 24 This is called primary MGN. Secondary MGN can be caused by certain painkillers, known as NSAIDs, Hepatitis B and C, systemic lupus erythematosus , or other conditions,  particularly other infections, but rarely also secondary due to tumors.\n\nAlthough nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age, it often affects children between the ages of eighteen months and five years. Below the age of 8, more boys than girls are affected. While most cases of nephrotic syndrome in children can be treated and managed quite well (see the ‘Treatment’ section of this resource), some cases or underlying conditions causing nephrotic syndrome are congenital and more difficult to manage. However, the most common form of nephrotic syndrome among children, minimal change disease, is not congenital.\n\nMinimal change disease is the cause of up to 90% of cases of nephrotic syndrome among children older than one year. 25 Although adults can have minimal change disease, it is very rare among adults. Most cases of minimal change disease respond very well to treatment with steroids (see the ‘Treatment’ section of this resource). If you are concerned that your child, or a child you care for, may have one of these kidney problems, you can do a free symptom assessment with the Ada app at any time.\n\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome is, generally, a very rare form of nephrotic syndrome that affects children from infancy; symptoms often appear in the child’s first three months of life. 26 Congenital nephrotic syndrome often does not respond well to treatment, and it is possible for the condition to become quite severe and for kidney failure to develop before the age of ten. End-stage renal disease may develop before puberty, although treatment can postpone this. 26 Congenital nephrotic syndrome is hereditary and is sometimes known as familial nephrotic syndrome.",
    "diagnosis": "Nephrotic syndrome is initially diagnosed using urine testing, as well as a physical examination. Visible edema is considered a sign that kidney function might be disturbed, but urine tests for protein generally, and albumin in particular, are considered more specific tests. 27 Albumin levels can be determined by a dipstick test, but a larger urine sample is needed if diagnosis if to be confirmed. Formerly, a twenty-four hour collection of the affected person’s urine would be tested for albumin, but this is now often replaced by a more convenient single-sample test. 11 A common urine test performed by medical professionals is a test on a single urine sample, which is often gathered first thing upon waking. 28 This test measures albumin and creatinine in ratio. A ratio of 30mg of albumin to one gram of creatinine signals that there is a problem. 5 Urine samples will also be checked for lipids and cell casts, which are microscopic structures that may be produced by the kidneys if nephrotic syndrome or other disorders are present. 1 Also depending on the result of the urine test, different blood tests will be carried out to help in determining what the underlying cause of the nephrotic syndrome might be.Blood tests for underlying causes may include: 1 Blood glucose levels and HbA1c to determine whether diabetes is present. Hepatitis B and C tests Rheumatoid factor HIV antibody tests Serologic syphilis tests While these tests can usually identify many causes, a kidney biopsy may additionally be needed to diagnose and clearly confirm the underlying cause and help in finding the best treatment option. 5 In children, treatment with steroids is often begun without waiting for biopsy results. This is because nephrotic syndrome is usually the result of minimal change disease. Biopsy may be likewise unnecessary in the case of adults with diabetes, given that diabetic nephropathy is a very common underlying cause. 6",
    "treatment": "Treatment of nephrotic syndrome usually involves a combination of supportive treatment intended to reduce symptoms such as proteinuria, edema, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and treatment of the underlying cause. 2 Steps should also be taken to prevent possible complications. 27 While some cases of nephrotic syndrome clear up whether or not treatment is administered, it is generally not advisable to wait and see, and medical advice should be sought without delay. 6 Prognosis in cases of nephrotic syndrome is generally good, but this greatly depends on the underlying cause and how effectively it is treated. Treatment may include: 1 2 5 Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) Diuretics to reduce blood pressure and edema Salt/sodium restriction in the diet Statins to lower cholesterol ACEs and ARBs lower blood pressure, which reduces the pressure inside the glomeruli. They thereby also prevent protein loss in the urine. Increasing protein consumption in the diet does not alleviate protein loss and is generally not advised. Blood-thinning medications should generally only be prescribed if the affected person has had a blood clot already. If possible, people with nephrotic syndrome should be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease and are advised to get yearly flu shots. 5 In children, nephrotic syndrome is often treated with corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone. 29\n\nNephrotic syndrome can cause complications due to the way it may unbalance bodily systems. Complications can include: 1 5 11 30 31 Hypothyroidism Protein undernutrition, in children High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia , due to changes in blood composition resulting from protein loss Coronary artery disease , in adults Blood clots (hypercoagulability), which occur because of abnormal protein levels in the blood Thrombosis in the lungs, limbs, kidney vessels or brain Anemia , due to a mechanism yet not fully understood, iron no longer being adequately transported in the blood Acute kidney injury, sudden, temporary loss of kidney function Hematuria, blood in the urine Severe azotemia, high levels of nitrogen compounds in the blood Infections, such as cellulitis, a skin infection, pneumonia , meningitis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which may  be more likely than in healthy people, due to a loss of immunoglobulins. Good to know: Immunoglobulins are proteins that form part of the immune system and help to fight disease and infections. If they are increasingly lost, the body is at increased risk of infections. Hypercoagulability and hyperlipidemia are not merely complications, but also classic features of nephrotic syndrome. Both states are the result of increased protein loss and the following protein synthesis. As albumin is lost in the urine, as part of the nephrotic syndrome, the liver is trying to compensate by producing more. Because protein synthesis is rather unspecific and not all proteins are being lost in the urine, the levels of some proteins in the blood, e.g. lipoproteins, actually rise. Simplified, increased lipoprotein levels lead to rising fat levels in the blood. Good to know: Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin in the blood) can sometimes also manifest as white bands in the nails, known as Muerkhe’s Lines. 27",
    "nephrotic_syndrome_faqs": "Q: What are NSAIDs? A: NSAIDs are a class of medications that are commonly sold over the- counter and reduce pain and inflammation. For this reason, they are often used to relieve headaches, fever and pain from mild injuries. NSAIDs work by blocking the actions of enzymes known as cyclooxygenases, which reduce prostaglandins in the body. Prostaglandins promote inflammation, pain and fever. Thus, if they are blocked, those symptoms are reduced. However, because prostaglandins also protect the stomach, long-term use of NSAIDs can also cause stomach irritation or even stomach ulcers. The list of medications classified as NSAIDs includes: 32 Ibuprofen Aspirin, depending on the dose; lower doses used for instance long-term, after a heart attack, may not be anti-inflammatory but just modulate the blood clotting Naproxen Indomethacin Diclofenac Celecoxib Ketoprofen Oxaprozin Piroxicam Many over-the-counter NSAIDs come packaged with a warning not to use them continuously for more than a few days without consulting a primary care physician. If your pain does not respond well to NSAIDs or worsens substantially at any time, seek further medical advice. If you have pain that is not responding to treatment, you can try to get an idea of what may be causing the pain by doing a symptom assessment using the Ada app for free at any time. Q: What is the link between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nephrotic syndrome? A: In recent years, doctors have seen an increase in the number of cases of kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome resulting from long-term use of NSAIDs. It is most often found in adults, usually in more senior people, but is also possible among children. 33 . Younger adults are seldom affected. 34 In most cases, the situation improves when use of the drug is discontinued. 35 However, in rare cases, chronic renal insufficiency may occur. It is likely that NSAIDs, which may reduce blood-flow to the kidneys, can sometimes affect the membrane that separates the glomerulus from the tubule in the nephron.These changes can contribute to, or sometimes even cause, the development of nephrotic syndrome. 35 NSAIDs can also cause other lesions in the kidneys, leading to a problem known as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). 36 Q: If I have nephrotic syndrome, will I need to have dialysis? A: Dialysis is typically only necessary for people whose kidney function has fallen too low for the body to adequately eliminate its own liquid waste products. Many people who need dialysis only need it temporarily. However, depending on the cause of the renal insufficiency or failure, some people may need dialysis for the foreseeable future, until a kidney transplant becomes available, or for the rest of their lives. As nephrotic syndrome is a sign of a greater underlying problem, whether someone will need dialysis very much depends on the underlying condition. 2 People with diabetic nephropathy, chronic glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, or other chronic kidney disease, have a risk of  developing kidney failure as a complication and therefore may possibly need long-term dialysis. 37 Those with acute kidney failure may only need dialysis for the short-term. Q: Is nephrotic syndrome hereditary? A: Some cases of nephrotic syndrome are hereditary or may run in the family. In particular, some types of nephrotic syndrome in children have been linked to several genes. 38 Q: Can babies be affected by nephrotic syndrome? A: Unfortunately, some forms of nephrotic syndrome can, although very rarely, affect babies. When it affects babies, this may have various causes. Congenital infections, such as congenital toxoplasmosis for instance, may rarely lead to secondary nephrotic syndrome that is not hereditary.  Congenital nephrotic syndrome on the other hand, has hereditary links and may often begin very early in infancy. It is, however a very rare genetic kidney condition which is only slightly more often found in families of Finnish or Mennonite ancestry. 36 9 39 Q: Can autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus cause nephrotic syndrome? A: Yes, nephrotic syndrome seems to be more likely to occur in people with autoimmune conditions than in the general population. These conditions may for instance include some chronic connective tissue disorders, e.g. systemic scleroderma, or systemic lupus erythematosus. 40 Lupus nephritis, which may then lead to nephrotic syndrome, often affects people who have severe systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause both nephritic syndrome and nephrotic syndrome. 41 42 Severe systemic lupus erythematosus commonly affects the kidneys and may cause the sort of changes – proteinuria and edema especially – that are known as nephrotic syndrome. Lupus causes glomeruli to become inflamed, which can affect how effectively the kidneys remove unwanted byproducts from the blood. 43 Q: What sort of diet should people with nephrotic syndrome follow? A: There is no evidence that diet can cause nephrotic syndrome or that adjusting one’s diet can prevent nephrotic syndrome. 5 Some dietary changes may be useful and supportive in the management of nephrotic syndrome, however. A person affected by nephrotic syndrome, or the caregiver of a child with nephrotic syndrome, should always discuss their diet with their nephrologist  before making any specific changes. However, generally it can be said that, with nephrotic syndrome, regulating salt and fluid intake is important, and some dietary changes can help to manage this, e.g., by drinking water or lower fat milk rather than soda and avoiding salty foods. 44 Dietary changes may possibly involve restricting salt, cholesterol and fat, eating more vegetables and fruits, and choosing lean meats. No specific changes should be made without first getting a professional medical opinion, and protein and overall fluid intake should only be restricted in case of a nephrologist specifically advising someone to do so. 45 Q: What is End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)? A: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is also known as kidney failure, a state in which the kidneys cannot function well enough to prevent the buildup of toxic levels of substances in the blood.In a person with healthy kidneys, these would normally be eliminated by the kidneys. People with ESRD very often need dialysis or a kidney transplant. ESRD is the final stage of chronic renal failure , which is nowadays commonly  known as chronic kidney disease. 46 Q: What is the difference between a syndrome and a disease? A: Although many people use the terms interchangeably, a syndrome and a disease are medically not the same. A disease or condition is usually defined as the body’s response to external or internal factors, such as a virus, bacteria or a faulty immune-system reaction. A syndrome is a group of symptoms or signs that may suggest the presence of a particular disease or disorder. The term syndrome may also be used as an umbrella term summing up the presence of multiple conditions or diseases. In the case of metabolic syndrome, for example, to give the diagnosis, at least 3 out of 5 conditions must present out of a cluster of  increased blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride ) levels. 47"

    "condition": "Onychomycosis (Fungal Nail Infection)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/onychomycosis-fungal-nail-infection/",
    "what_is_onychomycosis_fungal_nail_infection": "Onychomycosis (also known as tinea unguium) is a fungal nail infection which can affect the toenails and/or fingernails and which occurs in about 10 percent of adults in the United States. Onychomycosis more commonly affects toenails rather than fingernails. There are several different types of fungal nail infection, depending on the kind of fungus causing the infection. Onychomycosis or infected nails are most often caused by a type of parasitic fungi called dermatophyte fungi. Most types of onychomycosis have the same signs of infection: the infected nail usually becomes thick and discoloured. This process generally starts at the tip of the nail and progresses downwards towards the root. 1 As the infection progresses, the affected nail can become itchy and/or slightly painful. Infected nails may become crumbly, and it is not uncommon for part or all of the infected nail to break off. Treatment usually involves keeping the nail clean and taking a course of topical antifungal (antimycotic) medication.",
    "symptoms": "The first signs of a fungal nail infection are usually perceptible changes to the appearance of the infected nail(s). It is uncommon for an infected nail to cause severe pain or permanent disfigurement, but this does occur in some cases. If left untreated, fungal nail infections can cause difficulties with walking, exercising or manual tasks such as typing. The main symptoms of onychomycosis include the nail becoming: Brittle Broken Discolored Thickened Flaky Lifted away from the nail bed Mildly painful Separated from the nail bed. These symptoms could also indicate that an individual is suffering from nail psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease which can affect the skin under the nail. Nail psoriasis is more common in the fingernails than the toenails and can co-occur with fungal infections of the nail. If you think you may be experiencing the first signs of nail psoriasis or a fungal nail infection, get a free symptom assessment by Ada. Good to know: In people with diabetes, fungal toenail infections can increase the likelihood of developing ulceration and other complications, so medical attention should always be sought if a fungal nail infection is suspected. 2\n\nOnychomycosis or tinea unguium is usually caused by a buildup of dermatophyte fungi. These are parasitic fungi infecting the skin and nails, which need to reside in human or animal bodies in order to survive. Fungal infections of the nail are caused when dermatophytes burrow under the nails to breed. Specific types of dermatophytes which commonly cause fungal nail infections include the trichophyton rubrum , the most common type of fungus to infect the nails, and trichophyton interdigitale fungi. Other fungi which can cause fungal nail infections include yeasts , such as the candida albicans and molds , such as scopulariopsis brevicaulis .\n\nProximal subungual onychomycosis is the rarest form of fungal nail infection . Infection usually involves the trichophyton rubrum fungus. Unlike in other kinds of fungal nail infection, infection occurs, initially, at the proximal nail fold (the base of the nail), spreading up the newly developed nail plate . The proximal subungual form of fungal nail infection usually occurs in people whose immune system is compromised. Proximal subungual onychomycosis is a clinical marker for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) . 3",
    "triggers": "Wearing tight-fitting socks and shoes, which cause repetitive trauma to the toenails, is a primary cause of fungal nail infections. Onychomycosis is therefore common in people who play a lot of sport, as well as the elderly and anyone with a compromised immune system. Moist, damp environments serve as breeding grounds for dermatophytes. Healthy people typically catch nail infections from visiting places such as: Communal showers Nail salons and/or foot spas with poorly-cleaned instruments Public swimming pools, jacuzzis and saunas.",
    "how_is_fungal_nail_infections_diagnosed": "If somebody is suffering from a suspected fungal nail infection, it is advisable to visit the doctor so that they can advise on a treatment plan for the infected nail(s). Fungal nail infections are diagnosed based on the visible symptoms. Samples of nail clippings are usually sent away for a histopathology examination, the analysis of diseased tissue, in order to identify the presence of dermatophytes and decide on appropriate medication. There is a 30 percent possibility of false negatives when testing for dermatophyte cultures, so it is possible that the test may need to be repeated. 4",
    "treatment": "Fungal nail infections do not go away on their own, so a course of treatment is always required. This usually involves a combined approach of keeping the affected nails clean to reduce irritation and inflammation, at the same time as following a course of antifungal medication. Onychomycosis is highly infectious, so it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible to minimise the risk of passing the infection to others.\n\nThere are various precautions that one can take in order to reduce the risk of spreading fungal nail infections to others and to increase the chances of a quick recovery. To look after one’s nails and prevent the spread of infection, it is recommended that one: Change one’s socks and shoes regularly Dries one’s hands and feet as soon as possible after exposure to water Files one’s nails to keep the edges smooth Moisturise one’s hands, nails and cuticles daily and after contact with liquids Select shoes and socks made of natural materials, such as cotton Treat skin infections like athlete’s foot promptly to avoid the infection reaching the nails Trim one’s nails regularly Use separate scissors or clippers to tend to infected nails Wear clean, comfortable shoes Wear gloves for housework and other manual tasks\n\nIn addition to keeping the site of the infection clean, someone affected by a fungal nail infection may be prescribed topical antimycotics , i.e.antifungal products to apply to the affected area. Topical medications are currently the first-line treatment for fungal nail infections. 4\n\nThese include: Amorolfine nail lacquer Tioconazole nail solution Ciclopirox Always use topical antifungal products according to a doctor’s advice and/or follow the guidelines on the packet. In some cases, all or part of the infected nail may be removed , in order to give the topical medications the best chance to work. This treatment is usually recommended for severe or persistent nail infections. It can be carried out during a regular appointment at the doctor’s office. If the nail is removed surgically, a local anaesthetic will be applied to the affected area before the infected part of the nail is removed. An advantage of surgical removal is that it can be carried out in one appointment, and the course of topical antimycotic medication can then be started. Alternatively, a dressing containing urea can be applied to the affected nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days, during which time the urea will soften the nail, so that it can be removed painlessly by the doctor during a follow-up appointment. After the nail is removed, topical medications can then be applied. The infection is considered to have cleared up when the new, healthy nail starts to show visible regrowth in the nail bed.",
    "onychomycosis_faqs": "Q: Are there oral medications for fungal nail infections? A: Oral medications will only be prescribed to treat onychomycosis in cases where topical treatments and self-care alone have been prescribed and have not proven effective in curing the infection. 6 Oral medications for fungal nail infections can cause side effects, which include itching, headaches, diarrhea and a decreased sense of taste. 7 The most common oral antimycotics for onychomycosis are itraconazole and terbinafine, which work by gradually killing the fungi that caused the infection. The doctor will assess a person’s medical history before prescribing these medications, as they may not be suitable for everyone. People who have had liver problems should avoid terbinafine. Itraconazole has been linked to compromised heart function and may react with other medications, including pimozide, quinidine, dofetilide and levacetylmethadol (levomethadyl). Q: Is it always possible to cure onychomycosis? A: Onychomycosis can take a long time to treat, and some fungal nail infections can be resistant to antifungal medications. Treating a fungal nail infection can depend on identifying the appropriate medication that is effective against a particular subtype of infection. Q: Can nail polish cause onychomycosis? A: Nail polish is a sealant, so it can cause a buildup of moisture behind the nail, potentially creating an environment in which dermatophytes and other microorganisms can thrive. Avoiding nail polish is recommended while undergoing treatment for onychomycosis, as it could reduce the effectiveness of the antifungal medication. Furthermore, the applicator brush could be a vehicle for spreading infectious microorganisms. Q: What are the main methods for removing a fungal nail? A: Fungal nails can be removed surgically, using a tool to loosen the skin around the nail and remove the nail after a local anaesthetic is applied to the affected area to prevent pain. If the whole nail is removed, this is called avulsion. If part of the nail is removed, this is called debridement. Alternatively, the nail can be removed chemically (non-surgically) by placing a dressing containing urea on the nail. This must be kept dry for 10 days after which the nail is softened to the point where it can be removed painlessly by the doctor. Good to know: It is also possible to treat a fungal nail infection by removing the infected nail using a laser. However, laser treatment for onychomycosis is not usually considered, other than in cases where antifungal medication has been ineffective. Q: Are fungal nail infections contagious? A: Fungal nail infections can be passed from one infected nail to another due to direct or indirect contact. For example, toes which are next to one another on the foot may rub together, causing the fungi to spread to skin and infect other nearby nails. A person may also spread their fungal nail infection from one infected nail to other nails by touching it with their hands before touching other areas of the feet or hands and/or through the use of implements which touch multiple fingers or toes, such as nail files or nail polish brushes. People risk catching tinea unguium from one another when they share implements such as these, use public foot-baths or foot-spas, or share shoes or socks. Q: What are the best home remedies to treat a fungal nail infection? A: No home remedies for fungal nail infections are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, many people report success in reducing the severity of their fungal infection, or curing it altogether by using herbal remedies with antifungal properties, including: Applying products containing tea tree oil to the affected nail plate(s) and surrounding skinTaking herbal supplements and vitamins , as vitamin deficiencies, in particular being deficient in the B vitamin biotin, can lead to fungal nail infections. If you think you may be affected by a vitamin deficiency, assess your symptoms for free by downloading the Ada app Topical creams and rubs containing ingredients such as menthol, eucalyptus oil, camphor and thymol have been found to treat or cure onychomycosis, in particular, ointments which are traditionally used for decongestion. 8 However, their use in the treatment of fungal nail infections is a recent trend and is not universally medically accepted or FDA-approved. 9 Q: What is the difference between onychomycosis and onycholysis? A: Although onychomycosis and onycholysis sound similar and are both conditions that affect the nails, these two terms have slightly different meanings: The definition of onycholysis is the separation of the nail from the skin , which can happen due to a variety of causes, including a single injury or a repetitive trauma, allergic reactions to chemicals such as household cleaning products or nail polish, or as a result of having a fungal nail infection. 10 The definition of onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection . This may or may not eventually result in onycholysis if the infected nail becomes sufficiently damaged that it crumbles and breaks away from the skin. Q: Do fungal nail infections cause pus? A: The appearance of pus near the nails is more commonly associated with bacterial infections rather than fungal ones. Pus around the nails may indicate that a person is affected by a condition called paronychia, an infection of the skin beside the nail , most often developing in the nail fold. A bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause."

    "condition": "Open Angle Glaucoma",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/open-angle-glaucoma/",
    "what_is_open_angle_glaucoma": "Open-angle glaucoma, or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a condition in which pressure inside the eye causes damage to the delicate tissue and nerves on the inside of the eye.  This most commonly happens when pressure inside the eye increases, but can, in rare cases, occur with normal eye pressure. Pressure on the delicate tissues and nerves at the back of the eye causes damage and vision problems. Over time, this affects the ability to see and can cause blindness. Glaucoma is a common disorder of the eye and is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide. Open-angle glaucoma is one of several types of glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma most commonly affects adults and becomes more common with age. The exact cause is not well understood, but several factors may combine to cause this condition. Most people have no symptoms until significant damage to the eye has occurred. At this point, people with glaucoma notice that they cannot see clearly, especially at the sides of their vision. Open-angle glaucoma can be treated with medications, laser therapy or surgery. If left untreated, it eventually results in blindness.",
    "symptoms": "Open-angle glaucoma does not produce any early symptoms, therefore many people are unaware that they are affected. Because the vision loss that results from glaucoma tends to affect peripheral vision first, the unaffected eye may be able to compensate for the vision loss in the affected eye. 1 This gives the impression that vision loss is not occuring. 2 Over time, however, both eyes become affected. When approximately 40 percent of the optic nerve fibres are damaged, the vision loss becomes noticeable. 3 Vision in the central field is usually the last to be affected. For this reason, screening for glaucoma is extremely important. People who are younger than 50 years of age should be screened by an optician once every five years, and people who are 50 years of age or older should be screened every two to three years. 2\n\nThe causes of open-angle glaucoma are not well understood, but it's likely that the increased pressure is caused by a combination of factors. People over the age of 40 are more likely to develop glaucoma, and it becomes more common with age. People who are short-sighted, who have diabetes , who have African heritage and people who have a family member who has glaucoma are more likely to develop this condition. While open-angle glaucoma does not have early symptoms, there are several risk factors that should be considered if glaucoma is suspected. These include: 4 2 3 In the eye: Histories of eye pain or eye redness Halos, glowing or blurred border around objects Previous ocular diseases, such as cataracts Uveitis , inflammation of one of the layers of the eye Previous eye surgery Trauma to the head or eyes Severe myopia Elsewhere in the body: Vascular occlusion, blocked blood vessels in the body Diabetes , type 1 or type 2 Headache or migraine Hypertension Vasospasm, the sudden tightening of a blood vessel Cardiovascular disease Lifestyle factors which can increase the risk of open angle glaucoma include: 4 2 Obesity, a BMI of 30 or higher Smoking Medication for hypertension Use of corticosteroids Alcohol use Stress and anxiety Sleep apnea Previous surgery Unlike narrow/closed-angle glaucoma, open-angle glaucoma does not cause a rapid rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). In narrow/closed-angle glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork at the rear of the eyeball closes, cutting off the drainage of the aqueous humor of the eye, and increasing IOP.",
    "diagnosis": "When glaucoma is present, the loss of vision and increased pressure inside the eye is often noticed during a routine checkup by  an optometrist. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor). The doctor will check for signs of nerve damage, vision loss and elevated pressure inside the eye. Other tests may be needed to exclude any possible underlying causes for the condition, including blood tests and a CT or MRI scan of the head. Tests which may be done by an ophthalmologist on the eye itself include: 4 1 3 A slit lamp examination, in which a slit lamp, which is a combined light and magnifier, is used to examine the optic disc, the point at which the optic nerve leaves the eye. The object of this is to determine whether the disc has taken on a ‘cupped’ appearance. Tonometry, which measures the pressure inside the eye. Field of vision testing , to determine the extent of vision loss. Opthalmoscopy, which allows visualisation of the retina and optic disc. Pachymetry, a test of corneal thickness. A thickening cornea may indicate glaucoma. Gonioscopy, an examination of the trabecular meshwork, to assess the drainage of the aqueous humor. In open-angle glaucoma, this test typically does not find an obstruction. If an obstruction is present, the disorder is more likely to be closed-angle glaucoma. In addition, if it is suspected that open-angle glaucoma is the result of an underlying disorder, a complete blood count and a test of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate may be ordered. In cases where the person affected may have syphilis, a microhemagglutination treponema pallidum test may be ordered. If an underlying autoimmune disorder is suspected, a serum protein electrophoresis test may be ordered.",
    "treatment": "Treatment aims to decrease eye pressure with medication, laser therapy or surgery, in order to slow down or prevent worsening of the condition. Lowering intraocular pressure by 20 to 40 percent is the only treatment for open angle glaucoma. 3 5 Eye drops are a common form of first-line treatment. The eye drops may contain beta-blockers, which reduce the aqueous output of the eye. 3 5 People who are already using systemic beta-blockers should ideally use eye drops containing beta-blockers from a different class. Other drugs that can be administered as eye drops include various prostaglandin analogs, which increase the outflow of aqueous humor. ref4 ref5 Cholinesterase inhibitors, cholinesterase agonists and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may also be used. ref5 Oral osmotic diuretics, such as glycerin and mannitol, may also be prescribed. These work by drawing fluid from the eye into the bloodstream. All of these can be used as first-line therapy, depending on what other medications the affected person is already using and their tolerance of side-effects. Surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases. Options for surgery include: 2 3 5 Laser trabeculoplasty may be used as the first surgical option for patients who do not respond well to eye drops, or if eye drops have successfully reduced intraocular pressure without arresting optic nerve degeneration. In these procedures, a laser is used to improve drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Surgical trabeculectomy is an option for patients whose open-angle glaucoma has not responded to eye drops or surgical trabeculectomy. In this procedure, a small channel is created between the front of the eye to the conjunctiva, allowing drainage to bypass the trabecular network. Guarded filtration procedure and partial-thickness procedures are surgical procedures aimed at reducing intraocular pressure by improving drainage from the eye.",
    "prevention": "Screening people (testing patients without symptoms) who may be at risk of glaucoma can help to identify the condition early and prevent the complications of open-angle glaucoma. People younger than 50 years of age, who do not have a family history of open-angle glaucoma, should be screened once every five years. People who are older than 50, or younger but with a family history of glaucoma or other risk factors, should be screened once every two to three years. People with open-angle glaucoma will need to see an optometrist or opthalmologist at least once a year and possibly every several months, based on the progression of the disorder."

    "condition": "Osteomalacia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/osteomalacia/",
    "what_is_osteomalacia": "Osteomalacia is the softening of bones in the body, leading to bone pain, bone tenderness, bending of the long bones and, in some cases, fractures. Although bone appears to be hard, it is mostly made of collagen, the same material that flexible body parts like skin and tendons are made from. Bones become hard when a mineral, calcium phosphate, coats the collagen fibres in a process called mineralization. The more mineral in the bone, the harder the bone is. 1 New bone is being formed in the body all the time. If the new collagen fibres are not properly coated with mineral, the bones become soft and may bend and break. This condition is known as osteomalacia. 2 The most common cause of osteomalacia is a lack of vitamin D. In the United States, incidences of osteomalacia are rare, depending on location. People who live in cooler climates, particularly people with darker skin, are more at risk of developing osteomalacia. In most cases, the prognosis is good, and the condition can be cured with straightforward treatment, often involving a course of vitamin and/or mineral supplements. If you think that you might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "symptoms": "Soft bones are a typical sign of osteomalacia. It can lead to symptoms such as: 3 4 5 Pain or tenderness in the bones Muscle spasms and/or cramps Muscle weakness, particularly in the thighs and buttocks Waddling gait and/or difficulty walking Feeling of pins and needles , known as paresthesia, or numbness around the mouth or in the arms and legs, in cases of calcium deficiency Very severe cases of osteomalacia may result in: Bone deformity, i.e. bending of the long bones Pseudofractures, known as Looser’s zones, particularly in bones that bear weight such as the feet and pelvis Fractures of bones, especially after an event that would not usually cause such severe consequences, e.g., a non-severe fall in a middle-aged person Osteomalacia is sometimes confused with other conditions which involve signs of weakening of bones, specifically rickets , osteoporosis and osteopenia. See the resources on rickets and osteoporosis for more information. If you think that you might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "causes": "Osteomalacia is typically caused by a deficiency of vitamin D and/or phosphorus. Although vitamin D deficiency is increasing in some countries, this does not always lead to osteomalacia. 6 There are rare forms of osteomalacia that are caused by genetic factors or underlying disorders that affect the body’s ability to absorb vitamin D or phosphorus, such as liver disease, kidney failure or celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that can damage the intestinal lining, stopping it from metabolising nutrients well. 2 Lack of calcium can also cause osteomalacia, but, in Western countries, it’s rare for people to have a calcium deficiency. 2\n\nVitamin D is important for healthy bones because it encourages the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus. 7 The body makes vitamin D when ultraviolet (UVB) waves, which are found in sunlight, directly touch the skin, interacting with the body’s chemistry to form vitamin D3. 8 People who live in climates with seasons lacking strong sunshine, such as autumn and fall in the northern hemisphere, or who are unable to get direct sunlight on their skin, will not produce enough vitamin D to create the minerals which harden bones. 9 This increases a person’s risk of developing osteomalacia. Vitamin D deficiency has also been linked to breast cancer, bowel cancer, prostate cancer, obesity, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency »\n\nLess common forms of osteomalacia are caused by conditions that affect the body’s ability to absorb phosphates. These include: 10 Rare genetic disorders Kidney disease, though more common in advanced stages, and kidney failure Liver disease\n\nSome medications can increase the risk of osteomalacia when taken for a long time and/or in higher dosages. Some older epilepsy medications linked to osteomalacia include: 11 Sodium valproate Carbamazepine Phenobarbital Topiramate Phenytoin Other medications that are associated with osteomalacia include: 12 Cholestyramine, used to reduce cholesterol Rifampicin, an antibiotic Isoniazid, used for treating tuberculosis Antacids containing aluminum Saccharated ferric oxide, used to treat anemia Biphosphonates, used to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases Fluoride, used to prevent tooth decay",
    "risk_factors": "People who live in cooler climates, where there isn’t much sunlight during the autumn or fall, are at risk of developing osteomalacia. 2 Anyone who covers most of their skin when they go outside, uses very strong sunscreen or can’t get outside due to illness or disability, is unlikely to be able to make enough vitamin D from sun exposure, even in spring or early summer. 5 People with dark skin, who live in countries without strong sunlight, are particularly at risk. This is because darker skin does not make as much vitamin D as lighter skin. 9 Lactose-intolerant people may not get enough calcium and vitamin D in their diets to produce strong bones, and so may need to consume other foods high in calcium and vitamin D instead. 5",
    "osteomalacia_diagnosis": "Osteomalacia diagnosis can be carried out with a blood test measuring levels of calcium, vitamin D and phosphate in the body. 2 If low levels of these are found, then a person may be diagnosed with osteomalacia or another bone disorder. X-rays, CT and MRI scans can detect bone fractures. Rarely, a bone biopsy, also known as a closed or needle biopsy, may be done, in which a small sample of bone is removed and examined under a microscope. If you think that you might have a health condition, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "treatment_and_prevention": "Osteomalacia is treatable, usually with vitamin and/or mineral supplements, and most people can be cured. It is generally treated by administration of vitamin D, calcium and, if needed, also phosphorus. 5 If the osteomalacia is caused by an underlying condition, this will also need to be treated. Osteomalacia caused by phosphate deficiency is usually due to another condition. Treatment will be recommended by a doctor. 4 Bone will begin to strengthen within a few weeks to a few months and should be fully healed within six months. However, pain and muscle weakness may continue to be experienced during the healing process. 5 13 2\n\nThe amount of supplementary vitamin D a person may require depends on factors such as their age, how much natural sunlight they receive where they live and any possible other influencing factors, like having certain medical conditions or taking certain drugs that influence how the body takes up, processes or builds vitamin D. For people living in the United States, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine recommends the following daily intakes for adults: 14 Vitamin D: 600 IU (international units) / 15 mcg a day Calcium: 1,000 mg a day Phosphorus: 700 mg a day Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency » If a person’s calcium intake from diet is less than 750 mg a day, supplements of 500-1000mg a day can help speed up the process of restoring bone. 2 More than 1500mg of calcium supplements should not be taken in a day without consulting a doctor, as this could lead to unwanted side effects. 15\n\nAnother way of getting vitamin D is through diet, though it does not occur in many foodstuffs. Vitamin D is found in foods such as: Oily/fatty fish Liver Egg yolks Cheese Foods fortified during the manufacturing process\n\nThere are many things people can do in day-to-day life to promote healthy bones for osteomalacia prevention. These include: 2 Having a diet rich in vitamin D Getting a healthy amount of sun exposure Reducing alcohol intake Stopping smoking Exercising regularly Maintaining a healthy weight Other medications that are associated with osteomalacia include: 12 Cholestyramine, used to reduce cholesterol Rifampicin, an antibiotic Isoniazid, used for treating tuberculosis Antacids containing aluminum Saccharated ferric oxide, used to treat anemia Biphosphonates, used to treat osteoporosis and bone metastases Fluoride, used to prevent tooth decay",
    "faqs": "Q: Which population group is at highest risk for osteomalacia? A: The population group most at risk of osteomalacia varies in different parts of the world. In high-latitude countries, the most-at-risk groups are dark-skinned populations. In parts of the world which receive large amounts of sunlight, such as the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, predominant causes of osteomalacia include traditional diets low in calcium, dark skin and cultural, full-body clothing. 16 Q: Osteomalacia vs osteoporosis - what is the difference? A: Osteomalacia is the softening of bones, usually due to a lack of vitamin D. Osteoporosis is when bones lose density and become brittle, usually because of age or hormone related changes. While the signs and symptoms of osteoporosis and osteomalacia may be similar, the underlying causes and treatments are different. Read more about Osteoporosis » Q: Osteomalacia vs rickets - what is the difference? A: Rickets and osteomalacia are the same condition. The only difference is the age of the person with the condition. Osteomalacia in children is called rickets, but its causes, symptoms and treatment are the same. Children with rickets are at a much higher risk of developing skeleton abnormalities because they are still growing. 17 Read more about Rickets » Q: Osteomalacia vs osteopenia what is the difference? A: Osteopenia is similar to osteoporosis in that it is caused by loss of bone density, but isn’t severe enough to be classed as osteoporosis. 18 Q: Can osteomalacia cause osteoporosis? A: No. Osteoporosis is caused by the bones losing density, usually due to the aging process and/or hormonal changes in postmenopausal women. Q: Can osteomalacia be reversed? A: Yes. Bone is being renewed all the time, and getting enough of the right vitamins and minerals will allow normal mineralization to occur. (See What is osteomalacia?) The process takes around six months. Read more about the treatment and prevention of osteomalacia » Q: Can osteomalacia be prevented? A: Yes. Getting enough vitamin D, calcium and phosphorus, adapted to the special needs of someone with liver or kidney disease if necessary, will prevent osteomalacia."

    "what_is_osteoporosis": "Osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. This can lead to the bones becoming weak, fragile and prone to painful fractures (breaks). It is a common bone disorder which can affect people of all ages. According to the National Institutes of Health, over 53 million people in the U.S. are affected by or are at high risk of osteoporosis developing due to having low bone mass. 1 Bones are composed of protein, collagen and calcium. In healthy bones, these elements  combine to ensure that the bones have a strong structure. In people with osteoporosis, however, the density of the bones decreases. This causes the structure of the bones to weaken in a process which can worsen over time. Changes to the bones which occur when a person is affected by osteoporosis include: 2 Bone density decreases (loss of calcification) Bones become porous and spongy Gaps develop in the bone structure The sturdiness, typical of healthy bones, is lost Fractures may occur independently, or as a result of very minor knocks or falls.

    "symptoms": "Osteoporosis can remain undetected for many years, as it does not usually cause noticeable symptoms. For most people, the first sign of osteoporosis is the diagnosis of a painful bone fracture resulting from a minor injury, such as a trivial slip-and-fall accident (an outcome which would not be expected to occur in someone with healthy bones). People with osteoporosis are also prone to stress fractures, where a break occurs during a prolonged bout of a normal activity, such as walking, with no direct causal injury. 3 Other signs that a person might be affected by osteoporosis include: 4 Pain in the spine and back; spinal fractures can cause long-term or chronic pain Hyperkyphosis; a stooped posture, often characterised by a hunched back Diminishing height When a fracture occurs, the break will be accompanied by intense pain at the site of the fracture, which radiates out and also affects the surrounding area. Fractures most likely to occur due to osteoporosis affect specific areas of the body including: 5 6 Femoral neck (hip) Tibiofemoral joint (knee) Vertebrae (spine) Lumbar region (the lower part of the spine, which joins the torso to the abdomen) Thorax (chest)",
    "causes": "Bone density increases until a person reaches their early 20s. Generally speaking, from a person's mid-30s, bone density begins to decrease. 7 Osteoporosis is caused when their bone density decreases at a rate which compromises the structure of their bones, which in turn become brittle (easily broken) and spongy.\n\nAll bones perform a constant process of remodelling throughout a person’s lifetime. This involves the older bone matter dissolving (a process called resorption) at the same time as new bone cells produce new bone matter (osteoid). According to the International Osteoporosis Foundation , the principal reason that the bones weaken in people with osteoporosis is that the processes involved in remoddelling are occuring out of sync with one another. Old bone matter is dissolved at a significantly faster rate than new bone matter is produced, leading to gaps forming in the structure of the bones and an overall decrease in bone density.\n\nOsteoporosis in children is uncommon, because bones generally grow stronger throughout one’s childhood and young adulthood, and the loss of bone density usually begins in adulthood. Likewise, hormonal changes and health problems linked to osteoporosis, predominantly tend to affect older adults. However, it is possible to be affected by osteoporosis at any age, and there are certain conditions which increase a child’s likelihood of experiencing the condition.\n\nCertain genetic conditions which impede the development of healthy bones can cause osteoporosis in children. These include: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) Osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome These conditions cause osteoporosis in children by inhibiting the development of healthy bones. Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis is a rare condition in which a previously healthy child or teenager develops osteoporosis. 8 If you are concerned that your child, or a child that you know, may be showing signs of osteoporosis, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .\n\nIt is much more common for children, who are affected by osteoporosis, to contract the condition as a result of other medical conditions and/or the medications associated with their management, such as the steroid medications often prescribed for children with asthma , eczema and arthritis. Conditions which increase the likelihood of developing osteoporosis in children include: 8 Problems related to sex hormone production. Children who experience delayed puberty are at increased risk of experiencing problems with bone growth and maintenance. Inflammatory conditions. Bone loss is linked to inflammatory diseases, and osteoporosis is therefore more likely to be experienced by those with conditions like childhood arthritis and Crohn's disease . Gastrointestinal diseases. Conditions like coeliac disease impede the intake of nutrients, including those needed for the maintenance of healthy bones. Eating disorders. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia impede nutritional intake and engender hormonal imbalance, which negatively impacts bone formation. Conditions which compromise a child’s ability to be active. These include muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy.",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_osteoporosis": "Factors which make it more likely that someone will develop osteoporosis include:\n\nIn general, people with a smaller frame have thinner, smaller bones, which can deteriorate to the point of being affected by osteoporosis more rapidly than larger, thicker bones.\n\nAccording to the National Osteoporosis Foundation , of the estimated 10 million Americans with osteoporosis, about eight million or 80% are women. The two principal reasons why osteoporosis disproportionately affects women are that they tend to have smaller, thinner frames than men, and that their hormone levels change during menopause, with a drop in estrogen levels causing bone loss. 9\n\nOsteoporosis is particularly prevalent amongst postmenopausal women. Approximately 200 million women worldwide are estimated to be affected. 10 After menopause, the levels of estrogen in the female body drop significantly, which affects the body’s ability to maintain healthy bones. For this reason, the removal of one’s ovaries causes a decrease in estrogen levels and is, therefore, also a risk factor for osteoporosis.\n\nIn men, a decrease in hormone levels can precipitate the onset of osteoporosis, although not as commonly as in women. Conditions which cause one’s testosterone levels to diminish (such as hypogonadism), the long term use of steroid medications and regular alcohol consumption can all lower testosterone levels in men, thus increasing the likelihood of being affected by osteoporosis. 11\n\nAn increasing body of research supports the hypothesis that osteoporosis is a hereditary condition. People, whose parents have been affected by osteoporosis, are considered to be particularly likely to develop the condition themselves. 12\n\nSteroid medications significantly compromise the body’s ability to metabolise calcium and vitamin D. Both of these are essential for the maintenance of healthy bones. 13\n\nThe sturdiness and strength of one’s bones and teeth is dependent on the maintenance of their calcium content. Ninety-nine percent of the calcium within the body is stored in one’s bones and teeth. However, the body also relies on calcium for the effective functioning of certain processes, including muscle contraction, blood clotting and the maintenance of a normal heart rhythm. When the overall levels of calcium within the body are depleted, the calcium stored in the bones is extracted by the body for use in these processes. This depletion of calcium from the bones causes gaps in their structure which will eventually lead to osteoporosis. 14\n\nHaving adequate levels of vitamin D in one’s body is essential in order for the calcium, gained from one’s diet, to be absorbed effectively by the body. People with vitamin D deficiency are less likely to absorb the calcium they need in order to maintain healthy bones, which puts their bones at increased risk of osteoporosis. 15\n\nConditions like bulimia and anorexia nervosa involve severely restricting one’s dietary intake in order to lose weight. This results in malnutrition and hormonal changes within the body, both of which precipitate a loss in bone density, increasing the likelihood of osteoporosis. 1\n\nBeing active, particularly in young adulthood, is linked to cultivating higher bone mass and stronger bones, which are better able to withstand the process of aging over time. 16\n\nIn healthy bodies, the parathyroid hormone is produced in appropriate quantities in order to regulate the distribution of calcium within the body. People with hyperparathyroidism produce excessive levels of the parathyroid hormone in their bodies. When this happens, calcium is removed from the bones at a faster rate than is healthy, causing osteoporosis. 17\n\nThe chronic inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis results in bone loss. This is the primary cause of osteoporosis in people who are affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a condition which also causes immobility and physical disability, thus reducing an individual’s ability to be physically active – a key means of preventing osteoporosis. RA is also widely associated with high-dose corticosteroid use. These medications compromise the body’s ability to metabolise calcium and vitamin D, essential for healthy bones; this can lead to the development of osteoporosis. 18\n\nProblems, such as inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease, can heighten one’s risk of developing osteoporosis by compromising the body’s ability to absorb vitamins and minerals from one’s diet, including the intake of calcium and vitamin D which are necessary for the maintenance of healthy bones. 19 Feeling unwell? Get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app .\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization , in those who use tobacco products, bone density decreases at a faster rate than the bone density ofthose who do not. 20 By the time a person who smokes regularly reaches old age, this decrease in bone density is significant enough to correlate to weaker bones, and a greater likelihood of fractures.\n\nPeople who drink alcohol regularly and/or excessively are at greater risk of developing osteoporosis than those who do not, particularly those who do so in their teenage years and young adulthood. Ethanol has been found to reduce bone formation, leading to weaker bones which become increasingly prone to fracturing in later life. 21",
    "diagnosis": "The first sign of osteoporosis in most people is a fracture, which usually occurs as the result of a trivial slip-and-fall accident or in the course of one’s daily activities. People who visit the doctor with a fracture and/or are at high risk of osteoporosis are often recommended to undergo a bone density scan in order to diagnose and begin treating causes of osteoporosis.\n\nWhen a doctor examines a fracture, they will also order a bone density scan if they consider it likely that the fracture has occurred as a result of osteoporosis. Bone density scans measure one’s bone mineral density (BMD). The technology used in a bone density scan is called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA) or bone densitometry. 22 Bone density scans are performed to: Diagnose osteoporosis Determine how advanced the condition is Identify appropriate treatment options A bone density scan measures the amount of x-rays which are being absorbed by one’s bones and calculates a T score and a Z score. 23 A T score* is a rating of one’s bone density in comparison to a healthy 30-year-old. The lower a person’s T-score, the lower their bone density. Healthy bones achieve a rating of -1 and above. If one’s rating is -2.5 and below, it is likely that one is affected by osteoporosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO): A T-score of -1.0 or above means a person has normal bone density (for example, 0.9, 0 or -0.9) A T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 usually means a person has low bone density or osteopenia (for examples, T-scores of -1.1, -1.6 or -2.4) A T-score of -2.5 or below will usually result in a diagnosis of osteoporosis (for example, T-scores of -2.6, -3.3 and -3.9) A Z score reflects the number of standard deviations above or below what is a normal score for someone of one’s age, weight, ethnicity and sex. A Z-score above -2.0 is normal according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD). 24 The Z score is crucial to diagnosing osteoporosis, because an excessively high or low score can indicate the possible presence of other conditions which are precipitating one’s decreased bone density.\n\nThe procedures which are used to examine bone fractures can often provide additional information which is helpful in diagnosing osteoporosis. Procedures which are commonly used to examine fractures resulting from osteoporosis include: 25 CT scan of the spine. A version of computer tomography (CT) scanning called quantitative CT (QCT) can be used to measure bone density and determine the likelihood of spinal fractures. CT scanning is also used in the event of spinal fractures occurring in order to assess the damage and the alignment of the spine. MRI scan of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess fractures for the presence of additional diseases such as cancer – helping rule out a diagnosis which is not of osteoporosis – and to determine how long ago a given fracture occurred. Bone X-ray. X-rays are often used to examine the fractures caused by osteoporosis, as they can be used anywhere on the body to provide accurate images of breakages in bones.",
    "treatment_for_osteoporosis": "Treatment for osteoporosis focuses on four main areas: Healing fractures Ensuring that one’s nutritional intake contains appropriate quantities of vitamin D and calcium, often by incorporating supplements into one’s diet Taking medication to strengthen one’s bones Preventing future falls and fractures\n\nOsteoporosis does not cause broken bones to heal any more slowly than they otherwise would. Broken bones take between six and eight weeks to heal on average, but some fractures may require additional intervention. 26 Fractures which commonly occur as a result of osteoporosis and which may require additional intervention include: Hip fractures; a hip replacement is often needed Wrist fracture; an operation is often needed Spinal fracture; surgery and/or physiotherapy may be needed to correct the alignment of the spine\n\nLacking sufficient levels of calcium and vitamin D is a primary risk factor for developing osteoporosis. The body cannot make calcium on its own, and the production of sufficient levels of vitamin D (which the body needs in order to absorb calcium from food) requires exposure to plenty of sun. It is vital that one’s diet contains sufficient sources of both nutrients. People with osteoporosis are often advised to take supplements of both vitamin D and calcium in order to replenish the body’s levels of these substances and prevent further bone damage. One’s doctor will advise on the appropriate brands and strengths of supplements to take, depending on factors including one’s age, weight, gender and the severity of one’s condition.\n\nThere are many different types and brands of medication for osteoporosis. The kind of medication, which is recommended for an individual, will be selected based on factors including: 27 Age Gender Hormonal levels Ability to adhere to a given dosing schedule Preference Convenience Cost\n\nThe most commonly prescribed type of medications for osteoporosis are bisphosphonates. These are oral medications which work to maintain one’s bone density and delay the process of the bones breaking down. However, bisphosphonates may not be suitable in all cases of osteoporosis, as they can carry side effects of severe stomach upsets and heartburn (which can be lessened in most cases by taking the medication according to precise guidelines).\n\nPeople who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates due to digestive complications and/or the extent to which their health is compromised by osteoporosis and other possible coexisting conditions may be prescribed injected medications. Commonly prescribed injected medications include: 28 29 Denosumab (Prolia / Xgeva). This is a new medication suitable for both genders, which is unrelated to bisphosphonates and may be a viable alternative for people who are intolerant to them. It is also used in the treatment of bone cancer. Teriparatide (Forteo). This medication has the potential to rebuild bone and is most often prescribed for men and postmenopausal women with very low bone density. Abaloparatide (Tymlos). This medication can help new bone structure to form and redress the damage related to fractures from osteoporosis. It is the first medication to promote the formation of new bone structure, which is similar to that of pre-existing bone. Both Teriparatide and Abaloparatide are recommended for a maximum of two years of use, during which time one receives daily injections. 30 Injected medications are most likely to be prescribed to treat: People with extremely low bone density Children with osteoporosis People with multiple fractures Osteoporosis caused by steroid medication\n\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) can slow the process of bone remodelling and help increase a woman’s bone mineral density, and can be prescribed for both early and late menopausal women to combat the negative effects of the decrease in estrogen levels that accompany the menopause. It involves regular supplements of estrogens and also progestins in some cases. 31 HRT is not usually recommended as a long-term or first-line treatment for osteoporosis, because it is associated with severe side effects and health complications: 31 Cardiovascular complications (problems relating to the heart including unstable angina or heart attacks, strokes and pulmonary embolism ) Breast cancer Endometrial cancer Ovarian cancer Breast tenderness Vaginal bleeding Women are usually only prescribed HRT for osteoporosis if all other possible treatments are unsuitable for an individual. When HRT is prescribed for osteoporosis, it should be at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible duration.\n\nRecent research on osteoporosis and fractures in the elderly suggests that preventing falls is just as important to managing osteoporosis as monitoring and improving one’s bone mineral density. 32 Doctors are therefore advised to assess people with osteoporosis in order to ascertain the likelihood of falls which could result in fractures. They will use this information to devise preventative measures, suggesting changes to a person’s diet, daily routine and medications as necessary to avert the possibility of future falls. Factors which one’s doctor may consider in assessing one’s risk of falling and preventative measures include: 32 One’s history of falling, including the total number of falls in the previous 12 months Location of falls Ability to get up independently after falling Eyesight Cognitive function Other relevant medical conditions Walking and movement Muscle strength and function Medications which may make dizziness, falling or loss of balance more likely Changes to one’s home environment and routine which may help prevent falls include: Taking regular exercise; even in very elderly people, increased safe physical activity has been shown to reduce the likelihood of falls significantly, in part by improving strength and balance control Removing trip hazards like trailing wires Having regular hearing and eyesight tests Placing non-stick mats on areas which are likely to become slippery, such as the kitchen floor and bathroom Eating a healthy diet\n\nBone fractures resulting from osteoporosis may be more painful than regular fractures due to the splintering of the bone that results from their weakened structure. People with osteoporosis will therefore be prescribed appropriate pain medication in order to manage the pain that results from both specific fractures, and from the generalised pain which often occurs in the spinal area. Painkilling medications prescribed and/or recommended in the management of osteoporosis may include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) Prescription anti-inflammatory medications Nerve blocks Opiate painkillers Ensuring that a person with osteoporosis is able to enact their day-to-day regime as comfortably as possible may require further medical interventions. These may include: 33 Physiotherapy Educational measures (to equip an individual to understand their needs and make the best choices to prevent pain) Surgical interventions (such as nerve removal)",
    "prevention": "Osteoporosis is, in part, a hereditary condition, meaning one is particularly susceptible if one’s parents have been affected by osteoporosis. It is nevertheless possible to take measures to help prevent osteoporosis. Adapting one’s diet and exercise regimes, avoiding excessive consumption of alcohol, stopping the use of tobacco products and getting sufficient sunlight are fundamental factors in safeguarding one’s bones against osteoporosis. People who are sufficiently active and eat appropriately to prevent osteoporosis in childhood and young adulthood, build a stronger bone structure than those who do not, and are significantly less at risk of being affected by osteoporosis in later life. 34\n\nBoth calcium and vitamin D are required for healthy bone development and remodelling. Eating a balanced diet helps provide the body with essential nutrition, which can aid the prevention of a variety of conditions, including osteoporosis. The body cannot make its own stores of calcium, making it essential that one’s diet includes sufficient sources of calcium to provide one with one’s required daily intake (approximately 700 mg per day for adults). Sources of calcium include: 35 Dairy produce such as milk and cheese Soya beans and certain soya products such as soy milk (which are often fortified with calcium) Leafy green vegetables such as kale, broccoli and cabbage Tofu Fish with edible bones such as sardines Baked goods made with fortified flour The body can synthesise vitamin D using its stores of cholesterol when it has access to UVB radiation (sunlight). Some foodstuffs also contain vitamin D, and many products (such as soy milk and orange juice) are fortified with it. Sources of vitamin D include: Oily fish such as trout, salmon, herring, sardines, pilchards, kippers, tuna Cod liver oil (this contains large amounts of vitamin D and should not be used in conjunction with other supplements) Fortified dairy products Fortified soy products Raw milk Meat Egg yolk Often, it is not possible – particularly for people living far from the equator – to ensure that one’s intake of vitamin D is sufficient by relying on sunlight and nutritional sources alone. For this reason, in order to prevent conditions like osteoporosis, it is advisable to take a vitamin D supplement . Adults are recommended to consume a supplement of vitamin D. One should seek advice from a pharmacist or healthcare provider when choosing a supplement to ensure that it and the dosage are appropriate for one’s age and body-type, and that its contents do not overlap with any other supplements or medication one may be using. Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency »\n\nExercise is an essential means of preventing bone loss, which occurs naturally as one ages and can lead to osteoporosis. At least 30 minutes per day of physical exercise are recommended for all adults. Intense daily activity is proven more effective than infrequent, longer exercise sessions. 36 People with health conditions such as cardiovascular problems should consult their doctor before devising an exercise regime, in order to make sure that the physical activities they choose are appropriate for their capabilities. Activities which are particularly helpful in the prevention of osteoporosis include: 37 Weight-bearing exercise. The best activities for building bone strength are those which compel one to work against gravity, such as weight training, hiking and jogging. Regular exercise. Activities like walking fast and cycling constitute moderate-intensity exercise and are easy to incorporate into one’s weekly routine. Muscle-strengthening exercise. Activities which build one’s stamina and strengthen one’s muscles such as yoga, skipping and tai-chi can help increase one’s poise and prevent falls in later life. Stationary exercise. Many hip, leg and spine exercises which are helpful in strengthening the areas of the body most prone to fractures from osteoporosis can be carried out at home with the use of a straight-backed chair, and are easily incorporated into one’s routine.",
    "osteoporosis_faqs": "Q: How does one’s milk intake in childhood influence one’s risk of developing osteoporosis later on? A: Milk is a source of calcium, which is essential for the development and growth of healthy bones. The stronger one’s bones develop during their formative years (childhood and adolescence), the more likely they are to age slowly and stably, reducing one’s chances of developing osteoporosis. Daily milk intake in childhood and adolescence has been found to increase bone mass and density in adulthood more effectively than taking calcium supplements for the same purpose, once the skeleton is fully grown. Milk consumption in childhood is therefore advised in order to prevent rapid bone loss and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fracture in adulthood. 38 Q: What is the difference between osteoporosis and osteopenia? A: Both osteoporosis and osteopenia are diseases with the primary characteristic of a decrease in bone density and the conditions are  caused by the same factors. Osteopenia involves a lesser degree of damage to the bones than osteoporosis. The distinction between whether a person is affected by osteoporosis or osteopenia is most accurately determined by their bone density score. A score of less than -1 and greater than -2.5 indicates that a person is affected by osteopenia rather than osteoporosis. Osteopenia is a less severe condition involving low bone density which can progress to osteoporosis if left untreated. It is therefore important to seek medical attention if one is at risk of osteoporosis, even if one has not experienced a fracture, in order to identify and begin to treat possible cases of osteopenia. Treatment for both conditions should be focussed on treating the underlying secondary cause(s) where possible. Q: Is osteoarthritis related to osteoporosis? A: Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis both affect the bones, but osteoarthritis is a condition which specifically affects the joints, rather than the bones as a whole. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage at the ends of the bones, which connect at one’s joints, wear away, causing the swelling characteristic of arthritis. This causes one’s bones to thicken and harden at the ends, developing new structures called spurs around one’s joints which force the bones out of their normal position. The primary risk factors of osteoarthritis are being over 40, being female, being overweight and being genetically predisposed to conditions which affect one’s joints. Both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis can cause back pain and height loss. 39 If you think you may be affected by either of these conditions, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app."

    "what_is_otitis_externa": "Otitis externa is a condition that occurs when the external ear canal, the channel between the outer ear and the eardrum, becomes inflamed. The condition is typically the result of a bacterial or fungal infection, but can also be caused by irritation or allergies. 1 As repeated exposure to water can make otitis externa more likely, the condition is commonly referred to as swimmer’s ear. Symptoms include pain in the ear, itchiness in the ear canal, partial hearing loss and a discharge of pus or liquid. While it can cause severe discomfort, most cases of otitis externa resolve in under a week. 2 While ear drops are the most common treatment method, other options are also available for severe cases or when the condition is chronic or recurrent. Otitis externa should not be confused with the most common type of ear infection, otitis media . Also known as a middle ear infection, otitis media affects the air-filled cavity behind the eardrum. For more information, take a look at this comprehensive otitis media resource.\n\nThere are three main sub-varieties of otitis externa, each defined by the length of time the condition is experienced: 1 Acute otitis externa lasts for under three months, although usually for around one week. Recurrent otitis externa causes symptoms of the condition to be present in persistent bouts, each lasting for under three months. Chronic otitis externa is diagnosed when the condition lasts for more than three months. In severe cases, it can last for a number of years. Acute otitis externa is the most common form of the condition. 3",
    "otitis_externa_symptoms": "Typical symptoms of swimmer’s ear include: 1 2 3 Ear pain, which can range from mild to severe Partial hearing loss A feeling of fullness or pressure in the ear Itching and/or irritation in and around the ear Discharge from the ear, which can be thin and watery or thick and pus-like, and may be foul smelling A ringing in the ears, known as tinnitus Swollen neck glands Scaly skin in and around the ear Fever, although this is uncommon Both ears can be affected by otitis externa, but it is most common to experience symptoms in only one ear. The length of time that symptoms will last for depends on the type and severity of a person’s condition. People who may be experiencing the symptoms of otitis externa should see their healthcare provider. In addition, they can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "otitis_externa_causes_and_risk_factors_risk_factors": "Otitis externa is typically caused by infection. The ear canal, a narrow, warm channel connecting the outer ear and the eardrum, is an ideal place for bacteria and fungi to grow. 1 Bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus , are the most common cause of infection, but fungal infections from varieties such as Aspergillus and Candida albicans are also possible. 2 The condition may also be caused by seborrhoeic dermatitis, a common skin condition that causes irritation and inflammation of the skin. Irritation or an allergic reaction can also cause otitis externa. This could be a result of a particular shampoo, medication or sweat, for example.\n\nCertain factors and activities can increase a person’s likelihood of developing otitis externa: 1 2 4 Swimming. People who swim regularly stand a higher chance of developing otitis externa, particularly those who swim in unsanitary water. This is why the condition is commonly known as swimmer’s ear. Warm weather. Otitis externa is more common in countries with warm or humid climates. The moisture that results from sweating or humidity can create a good environment for bacteria or fungi to grow. Ear damage. Damage to the ear canal as a result of excessive scratching, the use of cotton ear swabs or long-term use of earbuds, for example, may increase the risk of otitis externa. Skin conditions. In addition to seborrhoeic dermatitis, skin conditions such as acne, eczema or psoriasis , can make otitis externa more likely. Excessive earwax. People with large amounts of earwax in their ears are more at risk. Although it normally serves to protect the ear canal from infections, excessive earwax can trap the bacteria that can cause infection. Otitis media (middle ear infection) . Occasionally, otitis media can produce a discharge which gets trapped in the ear canal, causing otitis externa. Weakened immune system. People with a condition that weakens the immune system, such as HIV or diabetes , can be more likely to develop otitis externa.",
    "diagnosing_otitis_externa": "A diagnosis of otitis externa will usually be based upon the symptoms present and a physical examination. This will often involve an otoscopy, a procedure in which a small, tubular torch, known as an otoscope, is used to examine the interior of the ear canal and eardrum. A tympanometry may also be used. This is an examination technique in which air pressure is used to test the condition and mobility of the middle ear. 5 In some instances, tests may also be run on the ear’s discharge in order to identify the type of bacterium or fungus causing the infection.",
    "otitis_externa_treatment": "People displaying symptoms of otitis media should consult a doctor. Treatment is aimed at relieving any pain, reducing inflammation and preventing the condition from recurring. 6 The exact course that treatment will take, however, depends on the condition’s severity, as well as whether it is acute, chronic or recurrent in nature. Before treatment is begun, the ear canal of the affected person may require cleaning. This helps to clear the residual discharge, allowing the treatment to be more effective. The method used to clean the ear canal will depend on the severity of the condition, but will typically involve swabbing, suction or the use of a syringe. Some of the most common treatment methods for otitis externa include:\n\nAlthough ear drops can be bought over-the-counter, stronger, antibiotic and steroid containing ear drops may be prescribed by a doctor. The antibiotic is able to fight the infection, while the steroid element is designed to control the inflammation. Typically, ear drops will take around a week to clear the symptoms. If this does not happen, the doctor may prescribe a different type of ear drops. 1 Alternatives to antibiotic medications may be prescribed. If it is suspected that the condition is being caused by overuse of antibiotics, or a skin condition such as eczema or psoriasis, steroid-only ear drops may be preferred. If a fungal infection is the cause, antifungal ear drops will likely be prescribed. It is important for the ear drops to be administered correctly for them to work effectively. To use ear drops, the affected person should: 1 6 Lie on their side, with the affected ear pointing upwards Place the ear drops into the ear canal and remain in the same position for roughly 10 minutes Press down on the cartilage on the front of the ear to ensure the ear drops have entered the ear canal If the ear canal is severely swollen or blocked, an ear wick may be required to administer the drops. This involves inserting a medication-soaked gauze into the ear canal, ensuring the drops are able to make contact with the affected area and work effectively. The gauze will typically need to be changed every two to three days. 1 Before beginning the use of ear drops, be sure to read the instructions contained within the packaging. If the drops contain antibiotics, it is also important to finish the prescribed course, even if the condition clears before this time. This prevents your body from building up an immunity.\n\nOral antibiotics will only be prescribed in particularly severe cases, or if there is a risk of the infection spreading outside of the ear canal. This may be in addition to ear drops. It is important to read the instructions enclosed within the packaging carefully and to complete the whole course, even if symptoms disappear before this time.\n\nIn particularly severe cases, a doctor may refer the affected person to an ear, nose and throat specialist, an otolaryngologist, for specialist treatment. 4 This may also be the case if an episode of otitis externa does not respond to treatment, or if a person is experiencing the recurrent or chronic forms of the condition.\n\nIf it is a mild case, the doctor may recommend treating the condition at home before prescribing any specific medication. This may involve the use of over-the-counter ear drops or sprays, as well as painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Placing a warm towel against the affected ear may also help to reduce pain. Keeping the affected ear dry is also important in helping the symptoms to clear. Take care while in the shower or bath, and refrain from swimming completely. Water, especially dirty water, tends to exacerbate the condition.",
    "otitis_externa_prevention": "There are several things a person can do to help prevent otitis externa: 1 4 Do not attempt to clean the ear canal. The ears are self-cleaning. The use of cotton ear swabs, towels, fingers or anything else to clean the inside of the ears is unnecessary and potentially damaging. If a person feels there is excessive wax in the ears, they should talk to a doctor before attempting to clean the ears themselves. Keep the ears dry. After swimming, shake the head to ensure all water is emptied from the ears. A hair-dryer on a low heat setting can also be used to make sure the ears are completely dry. Regular swimmers, especially those swimming in water that may not be clean, should also consider the use of swimmer’s ear plugs. Use preventative ear drops. Acetic ear drops, available from pharmacies, can help to prevent otitis externa. These drops should be applied before and after swimming.",
    "otitis_externa_complications": "Otitis externa is typically a non-serious condition. There is, however, a small risk of complications.  Possible complications of otitis externa include: 2 7\n\nA pus-filled abscess can, in some cases, form in and around the affected ear. Abscesses can be painful and may spread to other areas of the body. While small abscesses may resolve on their own, larger abscesses will often require the attention of a doctor. A doctor will typically drain the pus and may prescribe antibiotics to clear the infection and prevent spreading.\n\nOtitis externa can cause thick, dry skin to accumulate in the ear canal, leading to a narrowing of the channel. This is called stenosis. If this happens, the affected person may experience a temporary loss of hearing, and in very rare cases, deafness. Stenosis is usually treated using ear drops.\n\nIn rare cases, usually when the condition is chronic, the infection can spread to the eardrum. If this happens, discharge can buildup within the inner ear, causing the eardrum to rupture, or perforate. Symptoms of a perforated eardrum may include: Hearing loss Pain in the ear Discharge from the ear Ringing in the ear A perforated eardrum will usually heal on its own in around two months. During this time, no liquid should enter the ear. Due to this, doctors may prescribe oral antibiotics to treat the infection itself.  Over-the-counter painkillers can be used to manage any discomfort.\n\nOtitis externa can cause the skin to become damaged. When bacteria from the surface of the skin is able to move into its deeper layers through this damaged skin, cellulitis can occur. Symptoms of cellulitis include: Red, painful and tender skin around the affected area Nausea Shivering and chills Malaise People experiencing symptoms of cellulitis should consult a doctor. Typically, the condition will be treated with a short course of antibiotics.\n\nMalignant otitis externa is a serious but very rare complication. It occurs when the infection spreads to the bone surrounding the ear canal. People with weakened immune systems, such as people diagnosed with HIV, people undergoing chemotherapy treatment and people with diabetes, especially older people with poor glucose control, are most at risk. Signs and symptoms of malignant otitis externa include: Headaches Severe ear pain Exposed bone in the ear canal Drooping of the face on the side of the affected ear, called facial nerve palsy Malignant otitis externa must be treated immediately. This is usually done using intravenously administered antibiotics or, if antibiotics prove ineffective, surgery. Left untreated, malignant otitis externa can be fatal.",
    "otitis_externa_faqs": "Q: Are swimmer’s ear plugs effective in preventing otitis externa? A: Although they cannot guarantee complete protection, ear plugs are an effective way of preventing water from entering the ear canal, and thus of preventing otitis externa. It is important to clean the ear plugs with water, and if necessary a mild soap, after each use. They should also be completely dry before use. Q: Can otitis externa cause dizziness? A: Generally, dizziness is not associated with otitis externa. Dizziness usually stems from a problem with the inner ear, in otitis externa, the affected area is separated from the inner ear by the eardrum and ear canal."

    "what_is_ovarian_cancer": "Ovarian cancer, also known as cancer of the ovaries, is a type of cancer that affects females. It is the name for a number of cancers that can develop in the ovaries; the organs that store eggs and are connected to the womb. 1 2 3 4 While it is not the most common type of cancer in women, ovarian cancer has lower survival rates than other cancers of the female reproductive system. This may be because symptoms of ovarian cancer are not always obvious, leading to late diagnosis. The prognosis (outlook) tends to be better, the earlier the cancer is detected. 1 4 5 This type of cancer mostly affects women over the age of 50, and the average age at diagnosis is 63. 2 3 Every year, more than 20,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with ovarian cancer; in Europe this number is closer to 65,000. 1 4 Treatment depends on the type of ovarian cancer and stage of diagnosis, but typically involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. 1 6 7 Recovery rates tend to be better in cases where the cancer is diagnosed early, and where the woman is younger than 40. 1 5",
    "what_are_the_different_types": "There are several different types of ovarian cancer. These include: 1\n\nThese comprise the vast majority, about 90 percent of malignant ovarian cancers. Epithelial ovarian tumors develop in the epithelium, which is the thin layer of tissue covering the ovaries. These most often occur in women over the age of 50. There are several subtypes of epithelial tumors. Not all epithelial tumors are cancerous (called malignant, or carcinomas). Many epithelial tumors are benign, having less of a tendency to spread. Some epithelial tumors are called borderline ovarian tumors, or tumors of low malignant potential (LMP tumors); these fall between benign and malignant. They tend to affect younger women and have a better prognosis (outlook).\n\nCancerous germ cell tumors account for only a small percentage of malignant ovarian cancers. 8 They are most common in women under 35 and tend to have a good prognosis. The tumors, of which there are six different types, develop from the cells that form eggs. They are typically detected as a painful abdominal mass that gets bigger quickly.\n\nCancerous stromal tumors also account for just a small percentage of ovarian cancers. Stromal tumors form in the connective tissue cells, which keep the ovary intact and produce female hormones. Most cases are diagnosed early and tend to have a good prognosis. Stromal tumors, of which there are several different types, can produce sex hormones, causing symptoms that include: Unexplained vaginal bleeding Precocious breast development in young girls And, in some cases: An absence of menstruation Increased growth of facial and body hair\n\nThis is a rare type of cancerous tumor that mostly affects young women. There are several different kinds of small cell carcinoma of the ovary.\n\nSometimes, other types of cancer spread from elsewhere in the body to the ovaries. Examples include cancer of the breast , uterus, cervix and gastrointestinal tract. These types of tumors are called metastatic tumors.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Early signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer may be vague and similar to those found in many gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This can make the cancer difficult to recognize. 1 9 However, symptoms caused by ovarian cancer are typically persistent and represent a change from normal. If a person experiences any unexplained symptoms, it is advisable that they consult a healthcare practitioner, preferably a gynecologist, i.e. a doctor specializing in the female reproductive system, without delay. 10 Common symptoms of ovarian cancer include: 1 9 Bloating and swelling of the abdomen (stomach) Pain or discomfort in the abdominal (stomach) or pelvic area Difficulty eating or feeling full soon after beginning a meal Needing to urinate more urgently or more often than usual Many people with ovarian cancer experience non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms for a period of at least three months. 11 Less common symptoms of ovarian cancer include: 1 9 10 11 Indigestion (dyspepsia) Feeling full quickly (early satiety) Swelling of the abdomen (belly) Increase in circumference of the abdomen Nausea Diarrhea Constipation Tiredness Back pain Pain during sex Unexplained vaginal bleeding or discharge 12 Menstrual changes Unexplained weight loss\n\nA granulosa cell tumor (GCT), a type of stromal tumor of the ovary, may have signs and symptoms that are different from the above. These tumors typically present as large masses, which may be palpable. Abdominal pain or discomfort and unexplained bleeding from the vagina in older people are among the more common symptoms of GCTs. However, symptoms differ according to the lifestage of a person and may include the following: 13 14 In postmenopausal people (those who have experienced menopause ): Vaginal discharge, breast tenderness, cancer of the uterus and, in rare cases, development of male traits like male-pattern hair growth or facial hair caused by elevated testosterone levels . In premenopausal people (those who have not experienced menopause): Irregular, unusually heavy or absent periods, abdominal swelling (increased girth) – often with a mass that can be felt and, in some cases, development of male traits like male-pattern hair growth or facial hair caused by elevated testosterone levels. In prepubescent children (those who have not yet experienced puberty): Early puberty and, in some cases, development of male traits like male-pattern hair growth or facial hair. In most cases, GCTs are detected at an early stage, and the prognosis is good. 13",
    "causes": "The causes of ovarian cancer are not known. However, certain factors are thought to increase a person’s risk of developing the condition.",
    "ovarian_cancer_risk_factors": "Factors that may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer include: 2 12 3 Being over 50 Having a close relative who has had ovarian cancer or cancer of the breast, colon, uterus, or rectum Having an inherited mutation in the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or the breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) – this is particularly prevalent among Eastern European females and females of Ashkenazi Jewish descent Carrying genes linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), known as Lynch syndrome Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Infertility Intrauterine devices Use of tobacco products People over the age of 50 and those who have a strong family history of ovarian (or breast) cancer, a BRCA mutation or Lynch syndrome may be encouraged to undergo screening for ovarian cancer. 3",
    "ovarian_cancer_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can cause severe symptoms in patients being treated for ovarian cancer. This is because cancer therapy weakens the immune system, which puts you at a higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. It's important to take the necessary precautions and get tested as soon as possible if you start experiencing symptoms. Treatment options are available.",
    "how_to_diagnose_ovarian_cancer": "As the first step, a doctor will need to confirm that the symptoms are not being caused by any other conditions, including uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and gastrointestinal disorders. 1 A doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination, including a pelvic examination. If they suspect that ovarian cancer may be present, they will order an ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) to investigate. The doctor will also order blood tests to check, among other things, the levels of a substance called cancer antigen (CA) 125. This is a tumor marker that is often found at elevated levels in people with ovarian cancer. However, this test is not totally reliable; certain other conditions, such as endometriosis, can cause the levels to be high, and in some cases of ovarian cancer, the levels are not elevated. If the combined tests suggest that ovarian cancer may be present, it will usually be necessary to undergo surgery to confirm the diagnosis. In a small number of cases, a non-surgical biopsy, where the doctor takes a sample of tissue or fluid with a needle, may be performed. A pap test, which is used to screen for cervical cancer, usually cannot detect ovarian cancer. Read more about Cervical Cancer .\n\nThe aim of surgery is to confirm the diagnosis, define the extent of disease and remove all visible tumor. If ovarian cancer is suspected, the doctor may recommend an exploratory laparotomy or sometimes an exploratory laparoscopy, depending on the age of the person and size of the identified mass, among other factors. For the highest probability of success, a gynecologic oncologist, i.e. a medical professional specializing in the management of cancers of the female reproductive system, should be asked to perform the surgery.\n\nThe surgeon will typically make a long incision in the abdomen in order to check the area for any signs of cancer. Where possible, they may take samples of tissue and fluid, which will be closely examined by a specialist while the person is in the operating room. If cancer is strongly suspected or confirmed, the surgeon will remove as much of the cancerous tissue as they can during the same procedure. Called debulking, this may involve removing the uterus, fallopian tubes, and one or both ovaries, as well as nearby tissue and organs, if the cancer has spread. If a person is not a good candidate for surgery to remove the bulk of the tumor tissue, a doctor may recommend that they undergo a course of initial chemotherapy to reduce the tumor size, followed by surgery to remove tumor tissue, and further chemotherapy. 15\n\nIn some cases, for instance when the person is young and the likelihood of cancer small or where a laparotomy cannot be performed, this less-invasive type of surgery may be recommended. The surgeon will typically make a small incision in the abdomen to insert a laparoscope – a flexible tube with a camera on the end – and use this to check for cancer. Tissue and fluid samples can also be taken and the ovaries removed, if necessary, during the procedure. 16 Read more about laparoscopy, also known as keyhole surgery »",
    "what_are_the_stages": "Based on the findings of the exploratory procedure, the ovarian cancer will be classified as one of four stages, depending on how advanced it is: 1 3 Stage I ovarian cancer: The cancer is at an early stage. Tumors are found in one or both ovaries and, depending on the advancement of the condition, the ovary or ovaries may have ruptured, there may be tumors on the surface of the ovaries, or the cancer cells may have started spreading within the pelvic area. Stage II ovarian cancer: The cancer is still at an early stage, but has spread to other organs in the pelvis, such as the uterus or fallopian tubes. It may also have started spreading outside the pelvic area. Stage III ovarian cancer: The cancer is at a more advanced stage. While it may extend to the capsule of the liver and spleen, it has not spread beyond the abdomen and abdominal lymph nodes. Stage IV ovarian cancer: The cancer is at a very advanced stage, having spread into other areas such as the liver or lungs. Staging the cancer helps doctors recommend the most appropriate treatment programme. Generally speaking, the earlier the stage of diagnosis, the higher the likelihood of recovery.",
    "are_ovarian_cysts_dangerous": "Sometimes, a medical check-up will reveal an ovarian cyst – a fluid-filled sac either inside or on the ovary. Ovarian cysts are common in females of all age groups, and are usually harmless (benign). They may cause pain and pressure in the pelvic area, but many people experience no symptoms at all. The cysts do not usually cause irregular periods or vaginal bleeding. 3 The majority of ovarian cysts typically develop during ovulation (the process where an egg is released from the ovary), and disappear on their own within a month or two, without any treatment. 3 However, a very small number of ovarian cysts may be cancerous. If a cyst is particularly large, does not go away, has developed in a pre-pubescent or postmenopausal person, or if there is any other cause for concern, a doctor may recommend further scans, blood tests and sometimes surgery to investigate. 3",
    "what_are_the_treatments_for_ovarian_cancer": "Following surgery, during which as much of the cancer as possible will have been removed, further treatment may be recommended. The treatment approach will depend on the stage and type of the ovarian cancer, but, except in the very early stages, will typically involve chemotherapy. 1 In some cases of stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer, doctors may recommend a course of chemotherapy prior to surgery. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nChemotherapy can improve the likelihood of recovery from ovarian cancer. It typically involves the administering of drugs called paclitaxel and carboplatin through the veins, a procedure that is done approximately once every three weeks for up to six cycles. Sometimes, other drugs may be used. The treatment may also be administered directly into the abdominal cavity; this is called intraperitoneal chemotherapy. 1 3 The general aims of chemotherapy treatment are to destroy any remaining tumor tissue and increase the likelihood of recovery. 3 Chemotherapy can sometimes have unpleasant side-effects, such as hair loss, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and pain. A doctor will be able to advise on how best to manage the side-effects, should they occur. 3 For more information, see this resource on chemotherapy side-effects .\n\nAlso known as radiotherapy, this type of treatment uses X-rays to destroy cancer cells. In the treatment of ovarian cancer, radiation therapy is typically only used in cases where a person does not respond to chemotherapy, or where the cancer is very advanced, and it is no longer possible to administer chemotherapy.\n\nWhile a number of other treatments for ovarian cancer are being explored, further research is needed before they can be recommended. 1 If a person is interested in alternatives to chemotherapy, it is advisable to consult with their healthcare team. In some cases, it may be possible to participate in a clinical drug trial. More information about trials in the USA can be found on the following websites: 3 National Cancer Institute ClinicalTrials.gov A doctor will be able to advise whether drug trials might be viable options for a particular person.\n\nAfter treatment, a person will typically be asked to have follow-up physical examinations, scans and blood tests regularly over a period of at least five years. A doctor will be able to advise on which are necessary and how frequently these should be done. 3 If ovarian cancer recurs, the first indications may include abdominal (belly) pain, bloating, back pain and, sometimes, a noticeable mass in the pelvis. Blood tests may show elevated levels of tumor markers. 3 If there are any signs that ovarian cancer has returned, further surgery and/or treatment with chemotherapy (second-line chemotherapy) may be recommended. 3",
    "how_to_prevent_ovarian_cancer": "While it may not be possible to prevent ovarian cancer, taking certain steps may reduce the risk of developing the disease. In general, these include: Avoiding the use of tobacco products Eating a balanced diet and being physically active Avoiding exposure to asbestos It is also thought that the following may lower one’s risk of developing ovarian cancer: 17 Taking an oral contraceptive (birth control) pill Avoiding estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy where possible Having surgery to remove the ovaries Having surgery to block or cut the fallopian tubes (tying one’s tubes) Having a hysterectomy (surgery to remove the uterus, or womb) Breastfeeding Not all of the above will be necessary, or suitable, for everyone. Having a baby may also reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in people without a strong family or genetic risk. However, this should never be the principal  reason for starting a family. People at high risk of ovarian cancer are encouraged to discuss the most suitable approach with their medical practitioner. Screening and other preventative strategies may be recommended.\n\nPeople, who are considered to have a higher than average risk of developing ovarian cancer, may be advised to undergo regular screening for the disease. This may include blood tests and pelvic ultrasound scans. 3 If a person has a strong family history of certain cancers, a known mutation in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes, which can be confirmed through genetic testing, or if a person has Lynch syndrome, regular screening may be recommended from their thirties or another age determined as appropriate by a medical practitioner. While those who are not considered to be at high risk of developing ovarian cancer may not require regular screening, they are encouraged to go for regular gynecological check-ups and to discuss any concerns with a doctor. 3",

    "ovarian_cancer_faqs": "Q: Is there a link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer? A: Modern research has found no overall increased risk. One study detected a modest increase in invasive serous ovarian cancer specifically, but more research is needed. Those concerned may choose to avoid or limit talcum powder use until more is known. 18 Q: What is the rate of ovarian cancer recurrence? A: Recurrence rates vary by source, but ovarian cancer often returns, with higher likelihood in later-stage initial diagnoses. Treatment options for recurrent cases should be discussed with a doctor. 1 Q: Can a person have a child after ovarian cancer? A: It depends on the treatment extent. If both ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus are removed, natural pregnancy isn't possible. When only one ovary is removed, chemotherapy may still affect fertility. Options include fertility preservation before treatment through egg harvesting and storage, in-vitro fertilization (if uterus remains), surrogacy, or adoption. Doctors typically discuss fertility options before beginning cancer treatment."

This condition tends to affect older adults and people who have other medical conditions, especially pancreas conditions. Symptoms are unspecific and often occur late, which complicates diagnosis and worsens the outlook after diagnosis. It may lead to unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, chronic back pain and pain in the upper abdomen. Diagnosis is made by MRI or CT scans. Treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy and, sometimes, radiotherapy. People who are diagnosed in the early stages have a better chance of successful treatment, but this is not common.",
    "risks": "Cancer occurs when abnormal cells being to grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread through to other parts of the body. Pancreatic cancer involves the pancreas, an organ located in the upper region of the abdomen behind the stomach which usually produces substances which break down fats and hormones that manage blood sugar. Pancreatic cancer affects mostly people between the ages of 50 and 80, and becomes more common with age. People who smoke, who drink alcohol regularly and who are obese are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer. People which have another condition of the pancreas, such as diabetes, long-term inflammation (pancreatitis) or pancreatic cysts also tend to develop pancreas cancer more commonly. In some cases, pancreas cancer tends to run in families, and some genes and specific hereditary conditions are known to increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.",
    "symptoms": "There are often no symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer. The most common symptoms of pancreas cancer include abdominal pain which spreads to the back , unexplained weight loss and yellowing of the skin and eyes. Other symptoms commonly include nausea, loss of appetite and constipation. Many people find that their stools change color or consistency and appear paler and greasier than previously. Rarer symptoms include blood sugar problems and recurrent blood clots in the veins.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms and a physical examination of the skin and abdomen which may reveal yellowing of the skin and an enlarged gallbladder. Some people are diagnosed during investigation for a cause of changes in their blood sugar levels. An ultrasound, CT scan or MRI scan of the abdomen is done to confirm the diagnosis, and a small sample of the pancreas (a biopsy) will be taken and investigated for cancer.",
    "treatment": "Treatment depends on the size, specific type of cancer and whether the cancer has a spread at the time of diagnosis. These factors are used to determine the stage of the cancer. The treatment involves surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or most commonly, a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. Emotional counseling or joining a support group may also be helpful. People who have pancreatic cancer which cannot be cured may receive treatments which aim to improve their symptoms and quality of life.",
    "prevention": "Reducing alcohol intake and giving up smoking can help to reduce the risk of developing pancreas cancer. Maintaining good health, including maintaining a healthy weight and taking care to manage other health problems, such as diabetes, may also be helpful.",

This is a very common childhood condition, especially in children younger than 5 years of age. The middle ear is the part of the ear inside the ear drum, and helps conduct sound through the ear. An infection can be caused by viruses or bacteria. Typical signs may include pain of the ear, fever, hearing difficulty and difficulty sleeping. Infants may cry more than usual or pull on their ear. Treatment is pain relief and sometimes requires antibiotics. Most children do not develop any complications and recover well from a middle ear infection.",

Children who have parents who smoke may be more likely to suffer middle ear infections. Other conditions that cause swelling in the nose (such as allergies or swelling of the tonsils) may also make middle ear infections more likely, because this swelling blocks off a tube that runs between the nose and middle ear. Blockage of this tube can make it easier for viruses or bacteria to infect the middle ear. This tube is shorter in children, and tends to get blocked more readily than in adults.",

    "condition": "Pediatric Pneumonia (babies and children)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/pediatric-pneumonia/",
    "what_is_pediatric_pneumonia": "Pneumonia is an inflammation in one or both of the lungs that is almost always caused by a viral or bacterial infection. 1 The inflammation interferes with the body’s ability to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the blood. 2 A person is more likely to get pneumonia as a child, known as pediatric pneumonia, than they are as an adult. Symptoms of pediatric pneumonia depend on the cause of the infection and several other factors, including the age and general health of the child. Rapid breathing, a high temperature and coughing are three of the most common signs of the condition. 1 2\n\nPneumonia in newborns and very young children is more likely to be caused by a viral, rather than a bacterial infection.  Potential viral causes for pneumonia include respiratory syncytial virus or influenza infection . Bacterial infections become more common in school-aged children and young adolescents. The most common bacterial cause for pneumonia is a type of bacterium known as streptococcus pneumoniae, but there are several other bacterial infections that can also cause pneumonia. 3 Diagnosis is generally based on a physical exam and several other tests, which may include blood tests and an X-ray. 1 The prognosis for pediatric pneumonia is generally good. A bacterial infection can often be treated with antibiotics, such as amoxicillin. Viral pneumonia usually resolves on its own without the need for medication. 1 2 However, parents and guardians should be vigilant, as the condition is often hard to spot in children. Most deaths from pediatric pneumonia occur due to underlying health conditions, such as heart disease. ref1 Vaccination against bacterial infection is the best way of preventing the spread of pediatric pneumonia. 1 Children aged over six months old may also benefit from the influenza vaccine.",
    "pneumonia_symptoms_in_children": "Symptoms of pediatric pneumonia depend on a number of factors, particularly the age of the affected child, and whether the cause of the infection is bacterial or viral. 4\n\nNewborns and babies under a month old are the only age group that rarely cough as a direct consequence of pneumonia. The most common symptoms are irritability and not feeding properly. A child of this age may also display: 4 Abnormally fast breathing Shortness of breath Grunting sounds\n\nOnce a baby is over a month old, then the most noticeable symptom of pneumonia is likely to be coughing. All of the symptoms that affect newborns will possibly be present too, although grunting becomes less common as the baby grows older. Other pneumonia symptoms observed in babies of this age include: 4 Congestion, the feeling that the chest is full or clogged Wheezing or heavy breathing Fever, particularly during pneumonia caused by bacterial infection\n\nFever and cough are the most common symptoms for children over a year old. Other typical symptoms include: 4 Abnormally rapid breathing Congestion Vomiting, particularly following coughing\n\nFever and coughing remain the most common signs of pneumonia in children of school age.

    "what_causes_pneumonia_in_children": "Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacs, also known as the alveoli, in the lungs, usually caused by infection that causes them to fill with fluid or pus. 5 This inflammation interferes with the lungs’ ability to breathe and properly supply oxygen to the body, causing many of the symptoms described above. Pneumonia is almost always caused by bacteria or a virus. In children below school age, viral infection is the most common cause. School-aged children and young adolescents are more likely to develop a bacterial infection. 3\n\nViral infections that can cause pediatric pneumonia include: 3 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is the most common viral cause Influenza Parainfluenza virus, which also causes croup And less commonly: Rhinovirus Adenovirus Human Metapneumovirus Enterovirus Coronavirus Herpes simplex virus\n\nThe most common bacterial cause of pediatric pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. This bacterium is often carried underneath the nose of healthy people without causing any harm, but can develop into pneumonia if the bacterium spreads to those with vulnerable immune systems, such as children and the elderly. 3 Another possible bacterial cause is Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which usually causes a milder form of the condition known as walking pneumonia or atypical pneumonia. Walking pneumonia is sometimes confused with the common cold and does not usually require bed rest. However, in some cases, symptoms following infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae will be as severe as those caused by other types of bacteria. 3 6 A few other types of bacteria can cause pneumonia in children, including group B streptococcus and staphylococcus aureus.\n\nIn rare cases, there can be another cause for a child developing pneumonia. These include other potential infectious causes, such as: Aspiration pneumonia, which is when food, saliva or stomach acid enters the lungs Inhaling fungi, such as from soil There are also non-infectious causes, such as inhaling harmful substances and chemicals. Read more about the different types of pneumonia »",
    "diagnosis": "The first step in a diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia is usually a physical exam, where a doctor assesses the child’s symptoms. Their temperature will typically be taken and the doctor will listen to their chest with a stethoscope. 7 A particular challenge is finding out whether the pneumonia is bacterial or viral in origin. A doctor may ask questions about recent travel history and check their vaccination history. A chest X-ray is sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis or to look for any complications that pneumonia may have caused around the lungs. In recent years, there has been promising progress in the use of ultrasound, a scan that uses sound waves to produce an image of the inside of the body, to diagnose pneumonia. Ultrasound may replace X-ray testing at some point in the future. 7 Other potential tests include: 5 7 8 A blood test can help determine whether an infection is present, the extent of its spread and possibly the cause A sputum test, which is when a sample of spit or phlegm is laboratory-tested. This might confirm if a certain type of bacterium is causing the pneumonia A pulse oximetry, which is a test to measure oxygen levels in the blood A bronchoscopy, which is when a tube with a camera and light attached to the end is guided into the lungs so a doctor can look inside. This is rare and generally only used in complicated pneumonia cases",
    "treatments": "Treatment of pediatric pneumonia depends on the child’s age and health, as well as the cause of the infection. In most cases, particularly with school-age children, pneumonia can be treated or managed at home. Children with bacterial infections will generally be given antibiotics, whereas viral infections usually resolve themselves without the need for additional medication. Sometimes a child may need to be hospitalized for treatment. The decision whether to hospitalize is typically based on factors such as: 5 9 8 The child’s breathing ability The age of the child The risk of complications due to the type of pneumonia or any underlying health conditions the child may have The level of oxygen in the blood The presence of any unusual symptoms, such as altered mental states Hospitalization will usually involve giving the affected child supplemental oxygen, monitoring their condition and treatment with antibiotics. Any complications may also need to be addressed.\n\nChildren being treated at home for bacterial pneumonia infections will generally be prescribed an antibiotic drug called amoxicillin, which can come in tablet or liquid form. If this is unsuccessful, then a doctor may recommend alternative antibiotics. 9 10 Macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin, may be recommended if it is thought the child is affected by atypical pneumonia. 10 The antibiotics used in hospital will generally vary from those recommended for use at home. A doctor will base the antibiotic treatment on several factors, such as whether a child has been immunized. In hospital, the antibiotics may be delivered directly into the bloodstream using an intravenous drip. 9 10 Antibiotics are not a useful treatment for children with viral infections. However, if the pneumonia has been caused by an influenza infection , antiviral therapy may be used to fight the spread of the disease. A child’s fever symptoms might be helped with acetaminophen whether they are in the hospital or being treated at home.\n\nIf a doctor decides a child should be treated at home, their caregiver should take the following steps: Keep them hydrated by offering plenty of fluids. If a child’s cough is producing mucus, encourage spitting the phlegm out to clear the airwaves. If the child is too young to understand, then an adult should lay the infant across their lap and pat their back when coughing fits occur Relieve chest pain with a heated pad or warm compress on the chest area If a child’s lips or nails are bluish or grey then this may indicate that they are not getting enough oxygen. This is a sign that medical professionals should be contacted.",
    "complications": "The vast majority of children affected by pneumonia recover without any long-term difficulties. However, there are some potential complications, including: 5 11 Pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid between the layers of the pleura, the membrane that covers the lung. It is also known as water on the lungs. This liquid can sometimes become infected and cause a more dangerous condition known as empyema. Empyema can be treated by draining the excess liquid out of the body. Lung abscesses, which are pus-filled cavities that can appear in the lungs. These can often be treated with antibiotics. Sepsis , occurs when an infection passes into the bloodstream causing the body to respond in a dangerous way. In the most serious cases, sepsis can potentially lead to multiple organ failure Pneumothorax , the medical term for a collapsed lung. This is when air enters the space around a person’s lungs, which can impact upon the lungs ability to stay inflated.",
    "prevention": "There are two vaccines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends in the U.S. to protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia. 12 It can also cause a number of other conditions, including bronchitis and meningitis . Conditions caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria are known as pneumococcal disease. The PCV13 vaccine is recommended for all children under the age of two. It protects against 13 of the most common strains of pneumococcal bacteria. The first shot should be given at two months old, the next two at four months and six months old. A final booster shot should be administered when the child is between 12 and 15 months old. For children older than this age, a single shot is usually all that is needed. The PPSV23 vaccine is recommended for children older than two, who have certain medical conditions , such as leukemia or chronic cardiovascular disease. PPSV23 protects against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. Children with these medical conditions will generally need two doses of PPSV23. Side effects are rare. Allergic reactions to the vaccine are thought to occur only in one in a million cases. Nevertheless, a doctor should be told if a person has had an allergic reaction to any other vaccine. Taking a vaccine should usually be delayed if the child feels ill, but a doctor will be able to advise on this. The introduction of a vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae in the U.S. has coincided with a significant decline in pneumococcal disease in children under the age of five.\n\nOne of the potential viral causes of pneumonia is influenza infection , also known as the flu. The influenza vaccination cannot stop all children from getting the flu, but it is the best means of defending against infection. The CDC recommends that all children aged over six months should get a flu vaccine shot once a year before the end of October. A new vaccination is needed every year, because the specific influenza viruses that are spreading through the population change as time passes. Babies younger than six months old are too young to be vaccinated. The best way to ensure that they are protected against the flu is to make sure everyone around them is vaccinated.",

    "condition": "Pericardial Effusion",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/pericardial-effusion/",
    "what_is_pericardial_effusion": "Pericardial effusion is a buildup of fluid around the heart muscle. The heart is surrounded by a protective membrane called the pericardium, which is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. Pericardial effusion occurs when the amount of fluid between the two pericardium (sac) layers is abnormally high. 1 2 3 Good to know: Effusion is the medical term for a buildup of fluid. Effusions can occur in other parts of the body besides the heart membrane. For example, fluid can build up around the lungs; this is called pleural effusion. Often, pericardial effusion is mild, progresses slowly, does not cause any signs or symptoms, and is discovered incidentally as part of a routine medical check-up. However, if the pericardial effusion develops or progresses rapidly, the pressure it exerts may compromise the functioning of the heart and lead to serious complications, particularly where there is a large amount of fluid. Signs of pericardial effusion may include: 1 2 3 Chest pain Rapid heartbeat Feeling lightheaded Fainting Pericardial effusion can be caused by almost any disease or health condition that affects the pericardium, including: 1 4 Pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium) Infections and systemic disorders, for example, hypothyroidism , systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis Kidney failure and cancer. While pericardial effusion can affect people of all ages, the incidence seems to be higher in those over 50. 5 Generally speaking, in younger people the heart is better able to compensate for a progressing effusion. 2 The prognosis for pericardial effusion depends on the size of the effusion and the underlying cause. Small effusions are quite common and may simply require monitoring by a doctor, often resolving on their own with supportive treatment. 1 Where necessary, treatment for pericardial effusion involves addressing the cause, for example by prescribing antibiotics for a bacterial infection, steroids and other medications for rheumatoid arthritis , or anti-inflammatory medications for pericarditis . 1 6 Large effusions typically indicate a more serious health condition and may require drainage (pericardiocentesis). ref1 7 Recovery may take several weeks or months, depending on the severity and cause of the pericardial effusion. ref6 A possible complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention. 1",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Signs and symptoms depend on the size of the heart effusion and the rate at which it develops. People with small pericardial effusions that have developed slowly may not experience any specific symptoms at all. 1 However, there may be symptoms related to the underlying cause, for example, fever from pericarditis. Where present, symptoms of pericardial effusion may include: 1 8 Feeling light-headed or fainting Palpitations Rapid heartbeat (tachycardia) Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Chest pain, pressure or discomfort. This symptom may be worse when lying flat on the back, and relieved by sitting up and leaning forward Cough Difficulty swallowing Hoarseness Anxiety and confusion Hiccups Nausea and vomiting Feeling of fullness in the abdomen Abdominal distension (bloating)",
    "causes": "A wide range of health conditions can cause pericardial effusion. Possible causes include the following: 1 9 Pericarditis (acute or chronic) Viral infection (e.g., HIV ) Bacterial, fungal or parasitic infection, including tuberculosis Heart attack Heart surgery Chest trauma Kidney failure or injury Severe untreated hypothyroidism Whipple’s disease Familial Mediterranean fever Cancer Radiation (e.g., radiotherapy) Sarcoidosis (an inflammatory condition that can affect many organs) Autoimmune conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis Certain medications (e.g., blood pressure and blood clotting medications) In many cases of pericardial effusion the cause of the fluid buildup is unknown. This is called idiopathic pericardial effusion.",
    "diagnosing_pericardial_effusion": "The first step in diagnosing pericardial effusion will be for a doctor to take the affected person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. The doctor will typically measure the individual’s blood pressure, and pulse, and listen to the heart through a stethoscope for audible signs of fluid buildup. 1 9 Where the pericardial effusion has developed slowly, symptoms may be absent or minimal. A doctor will usually look for the following: Accelerated pulse Low blood pressure Muted heartbeat (through the stethoscope) The doctor will also look for possible signs of chronic heart failure , including: General physical weakness Distended jugular veins (in the neck) Fast or labored (difficult) breathing Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (belly) Swollen legs Rapid development of low blood pressure, muted heart sounds and distended jugular veins may indicate the life-threatening condition of cardiac tamponade. 1 9 It is likely that the doctor will request further tests, such as an ECG (electrocardiogram) or ultrasound, to confirm the diagnosis of pericardial effusion and establish the cause. Tests may include: 1 9 Blood tests: These can identify infections, autoimmune conditions, thyroid dysfunction , kidney failure and other possible underlying causes of pericardial effusion. Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound scan or echo will show the size and shape of the heart and whether fluid has accumulated in the pericardium. This type of scan, which is widely available, is particularly important in the diagnosis of pericardial effusion. Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG): An ECG is a test that measures the heart’s electrical activity. Pericardial effusion may cause abnormal patterns to show on an ECG. Chest X-ray: The heart may appear enlarged where there is significant pericardial effusion. It may have a “water bottle” shape. CT or MRI scan: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests may present a clearer picture of the presence and size of pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis: Removal of a small amount of fluid from the pericardium, using a needle, allows for testing for infections (e.g, tuberculosis ) and tumor markers. In addition, the doctor may ask for a pericardial biopsy to be performed. 1 In this procedure, a small amount of tissue is removed from the pericardium to test for infection and other possible causes of pericardial effusion. 10",
    "how_is_pericardial_effusion_treated": "Treatment of pericardial effusion depends on the cause and severity of the condition. In some cases where the effusion is small and uncomplicated, it may resolve on its own, with anti-inflammatory medication recommended to help the healing process. 11 Treatment approaches may include: 1 2 12 Strategies to reduce symptoms: These include: Oxygen therapy where circulation is compromised Diuretics (water pills) Other heart failure medication Strategies to treat complications: These include pericardiocentesis where cardiac tamponade is present Strategies to identify and treat the underlying condition: These include: Pericardiocentesis, pericardial biopsy, antibiotics where a bacterial infection is present Steroids and other medications where rheumatoid arthritis is implicated Chemotherapy , radiation therapy and other treatments where cancer is the cause In some cases, surgical treatment may be necessary.\n\nIf pericarditis is present, treatment may include NSAIDs and, in certain cases, a course of colchicine – another type of medication that reduces inflammation. Colchicine may improve the prognosis and help prevent pericarditis recurring. If the pericarditis does not respond to treatment, a course of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be necessary. 13 14 15 In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), however, corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process. 16 Read more about pericarditis treatment »\n\nLarge effusions that persist or are at risk of causing cardiac tamponade may be treated with pericardiocentesis. In this procedure, excess fluid is drained from the pericardium using a needle and catheter (thin tube). The doctor will typically rely on echocardiography (ultrasound) to guide the process. 1 4 8 12\n\nWhere the pericardial effusion is very large and repeated pericardiocentesis has not been effective, surgery may be recommended. The following procedures may be used: Subxiphoid pericardiostomy: Also called a “pericardial window”, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and has a high success rate. The doctor will make an incision under the breastbone and remove a small part of the pericardium to drain the excess fluid. 1 8 Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: This is also known as VATS or thoracoscopy. Although the procedure involves general anesthesia, it is minimally invasive, requiring only small incisions in the chest wall. The doctor will use a tiny camera to view the pericardium and make a more accurate diagnosis, and can then drain excess fluid by creating a small hole in the pericardium (pleuropericardial window). 17 18\n\nWhere surgery is not recommended, the following interventions may be used: Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy: During this procedure, a doctor inserts a needle into the pericardium via the chest wall. The needle is then replaced with a catheter, which has an inflatable balloon at the tip. This balloon is inflated to create a small hole in the pericardium through which excess fluid can be drained. Balloon pericardiotomy is predominantly used for repeated pericardial effusion that is caused by cancer. 1 8 19 Intrapericardial sclerosis: In this procedure, a medication is administered to the pericardium to treat the effusion. Medications used include the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline and the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, among others. 1",
    "complications": "Complications that can arise from pericardial effusion include cardiac tamponade, as well as  large effusions that recur or persist for longer than six months.\n\nThis is a life-threatening condition that may develop from pericardial effusion. If the fluid exerts pressure on the heart to the extent that its pumping ability is compromised, immediate treatment is required to prevent mortality. Symptoms of cardiac tamponade may develop rapidly (within minutes or hours) and can include: Shortness of breath Weakness and faintness Nausea Palpitations Confusion or loss of consciousness Blurred vision If you think that you might have signs of cardiac tamponade, call emergency services immediately. Cardiac tamponade is treated with emergency pericardiocentesis or surgery. In severe cases, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be required. 1 20 21\n\nIn some cases, large effusions may recur or persist for longer than six months and require ongoing medical treatment. 1 The affected individual may not experience any symptoms or problems. However, because pericardial effusion may lead to cardiac tamponade, going for regular check-ups and ensuring careful management of heart health is critical. The doctor may recommend pericardiocentesis to drain the cardiac effusion as a preventative measure. 6 In many cases, however, pericardiocentesis alone may prove inadequate, and a pericardiectomy may also be necessary. 2 Good to know: Small pericardial effusions that persist for a long period of time are fairly common, and are not as much of a concern as large effusions.",
    "other_names_for_pericardial_effusion": "Fluid around the heart",
    "faqs": "Q: What causes fluid around the heart? A: Pericardial effusion can be caused by many different conditions that affect the membrane of the heart, resulting in pericarditis. These include: Viral and bacterial infections such as tuberculosis Kidney failure Cancer Systemic lupus erythematosus Rheumatoid arthritis Inadequately managed hypothyroidism Chest injuries Heart attack Heart surgery Some medications In many cases, the cause of pericardial effusion is unknown. Q: Is pericardial effusion serious? A: Pericardial effusion can be serious. Many cases are mild and do not cause any symptoms or long-term health problems, but some cases,particularly those that develop rapidly and involve a large buildup of fluid, can lead to life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade. If you think that you might have signs of pericardial effusion, it is recommended that you contact a doctor without delay. Q: Can pericardial effusion return? A: Yes, pericardial effusion can recur. Many cases clear up and do not come back, but in some cases chronic pericardial effusion may develop. See the section on chronic pericardial effusion above for more details. Q: Pericardial effusion vs. cardiac tamponade – what is the difference? A: Pericardial effusion is the term for an accumulation of fluid around the heart. The amount of fluid may be small or large, and the condition is not always serious or life-threatening. Cardiac tamponade is a rare but life-threatening possible complication of pericardial effusion and other heart conditions. Cardiac tamponade is when fluid exerts pressure on the heart, impeding its ability to pump and sometimes leading to cardiac arrest. Cardiac tamponade may develop very quickly and requires emergency treatment to prevent mortality. 1 22 Q: Pericardial effusion vs. pericarditis - what is the difference? A: Pericardial effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the heart. The membrane around the heart is called the pericardium; this is a sac made up of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in the middle. If this fluid increases beyond normal levels, it is called pericardial effusion. Pericarditis is the term for inflammation of the pericardium. Pericarditis can cause pericardial effusion. Read more about Pericarditis » Q: Pericardial effusion vs. pleural effusion - what is the difference? A: Pericardial effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the heart. Pleural effusion is the term for a buildup of fluid around the lungs, or, more accurately, in the space between the lungs and the chest cavity. 23 Q: Is there a connection between pericardial effusion and cancer? A: Yes. Cancer may be a cause of pericardial effusion where it has spread to the pericardium. These cases of pericardial effusion are very serious and require urgent medical treatment. 12 The types of cancer that most commonly cause pericardial effusion include: 24 Lung cancer Breast cancer Leukemia Lymphoma Q: Can pericardial effusion be prevented? A: It is not usually possible to prevent pericardial effusion. However, steps can be taken to prevent the condition becoming more serious or developing into cardiac tamponade. These steps include: 25 Seeking treatment without delay Following the treatment plan (for example, taking medications as prescribed) Listening to a doctor’s advice for ongoing medical care"

The pericardium, which keeps the heart in place and prevents friction from surrounding organs, is a sac comprised of two layers of tissue with lubricating fluid in between. When pericarditis occurs, this tissue becomes inflamed and may rub against the heart, causing chest pain that is sometimes mistaken for a heart attack . 1 2 3 Pericarditis is a relatively common heart condition. It is estimated to be the cause of 5 percent of visits to hospital emergency rooms for chest pain. The condition can affect people of all ages, but is most common in men between 20 and 50 years old. 1 4 In most cases, the cause of pericarditis is unknown. Viral infections are a common trigger, but the cause may also be: 3 Another type of infection A chest injury Heart attack Heart surgery Another medical condition, or Certain medicines, such as penicillin and some chemotherapy drugs Pericarditis may develop suddenly and be short-lived (acute), or develop over time and be a chronic condition. Most cases of acute pericarditis are mild and clear up on their own within a few days to a number of weeks with rest and medication to reduce the inflammation. However, roughly 20 to 50 percent of people treated for acute pericarditis may go on to develop recurrent pericarditis, which requires long-term treatment. Though uncommon in pericarditis, life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis may occur and necessitate immediate intervention. In all cases, the prognosis depends largely on the cause of the pericarditis. 1 2 4",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptom of pericarditis is chest pain. 5 This may develop suddenly and be experienced as a sharp, stabbing sensation behind the breastbone on the left side of the body. However, for some people there may be a constant, steady pain, or more of a dull ache or feeling of pressure. The chest pain may radiate into the left shoulder and neck, and tends to be worse when breathing deeply, coughing, swallowing or lying down. Sitting up or leaning forward may ease the pain. Individuals experiencing pericarditis may also present with: 2 4 5 Fever Fatigue or weakness Shortness of breath (particularly if cardiac tamponade develops) Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing Rapid heartbeat Palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding) Nausea Chills Cough Swelling of the legs or abdomen Low blood pressure (in severe cases) If any symptoms are present and pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately.",
    "causes": "Viruses are the most common cause of acute pericarditis. A number of different viruses are associated with the heart condition, including, among others: 4 5 Coxsackieviruses Echoviruses Adenoviruses (e.g. the common cold , pneumonia ) HIV Influenza Hepatitis viruses Other causes of pericarditis include: 3 4 5 Bacterial infection (usually spread from nearby tissues or wounds after heart surgery) Tuberculosis Fungi and parasites Kidney failure Heart attack or heart surgery Chest injury (e.g., a stab wound or car accident) Radiotherapy to treat cancers in the chest Cancer that has spread from another part of the body (rare) Autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus ) Inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease Certain medications (e.g., penicillin, phenytoin, warfarin and rifampin) In many cases, no cause can be identified and the condition is termed idiopathic pericarditis. The cause of recurrent pericarditis is unknown, though it is thought that irregularities in the immune system may play a role. Pericarditis may result from autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue or cells. 1",
    "diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosing pericarditis will be for a doctor to take the affected person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. The doctor will typically listen to the heart using a stethoscope to check for a common sign of pericarditis known as a pericardial friction rub (or pericardial rub). This is a distinct rasping or grating noise caused by the inflamed pericardial layers rubbing against each other. 3 5 The doctor will also listen for signs of excess fluid in the pericardium ( pericardial effusion ) or lungs (pleural effusion). A small amount of excess fluid in the pericardium is not a cause for great concern and usually clears up on its own. However, if the fluid builds up, it may lead to the potentially life-threatening condition known as cardiac tamponade. This can cause serious complications, including compromised pumping function of the heart, and requires urgent medical treatment. 5 If pericarditis is suspected, the doctor may order imaging and laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate it from other conditions such as heart attack and peptic ulcer disease. These tests could include any of the following: 2 3 4 5 Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): A test that traces the heart’s electrical activity. Pericarditis may produce abnormal patterns. Chest X-ray: While most people with acute pericarditis have a normal X-ray, this test can show an enlarged heart where there is significant pericardial effusion , and help rule out other causes. Echocardiogram: A heart ultrasound scan that shows the size, shape and movement of the heart, and whether fluid has accumulated in the pericardium. An echocardiogram can indicate whether the fluid is causing cardiac tamponade. Blood tests: These can detect underlying infections, as well as the presence of inflammatory markers. In addition, the doctor may request a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to obtain a more detailed image of the heart and surrounding organs. If tuberculosis is suspected , the doctor may also decide to take a sample of fluid from the pericardium, using a needle and syringe.",
    "classification_and_treatment": "Treatment depends on the severity and type of the pericarditis. The goals are to relieve pain and reduce inflammation, address the underlying cause where possible, and detect and manage possible complications. 7\n\nA doctor will assess whether the affected person can safely be treated at home, or whether they need to be admitted to hospital. A person is more likely to be admitted to hospital as they have an increased risk of complications if any of the following applies: 3 A high fever Signs of cardiac tamponade Signs of serious pericardial effusion Recent treatment with blood thinners In addition, if outpatient treatment is not successful, hospital admission will typically be required. Where hospitalization is unnecessary, a doctor may advise the affected person to rest at home and prescribe anti-inflammatory medication, such as aspirin or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen to reduce pain and inflammation. 8 5 7 If the pain is severe or the symptoms do not improve within two weeks, colchicine, a medication that reduces inflammation, may be prescribed. Colchicine improves the outlook of pericarditis and reduces the likelihood of it recurring. 3 4 5 7 If the pericarditis does not respond to this treatment, a course of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be recommended. Because the risk of recurrent pericarditis may increase when steroids are used, they tend to be prescribed with caution. In cases of acute pericarditis caused by myocardial infarction (heart attack), corticosteroids cannot be used, as they may negatively affect the healing process. 3 4 5 7 If the cause of pericarditis is bacterial, antibiotics may be prescribed. 3\n\nRepeat episodes of pericarditis are typically managed in the same way as acute pericarditis, with anti-inflammatory medication prescribed to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. A long-term course of colchicine may help prevent a relapse of symptoms. Corticosteroids are usually used as a last resort. Recurrent pericarditis, also known as relapsing pericarditis, may be incessant – where there is a relapse within six weeks of stopping treatment (this may be a continuation of the first episode of pericarditis), or intermittent – where more than six weeks pass between relapses (a true recurrence). The condition may be debilitating. 3 9 10 Where recurrent pericarditis is severe and unresponsive to treatment, surgery may be recommended. The procedure is called a pericardiectomy and involves the removal of a part or most of the pericardium. 3 9\n\nThis is a rare but serious potential complication of pericarditis. It develops when the pericardium is inflamed for a long period of time, and subsequently thickens and contracts around the heart, compromising its functioning. Symptoms of constrictive pericarditis may include: 3 5 Swelling of the legs, ankles and other parts of the body Tiredness Shortness of breath Constrictive pericarditis may be transient or chronic. Where the condition is chronic, a pericardiectomy is typically the only effective treatment. If constrictive pericarditis is suspected, medical advice should be sought immediately. 2 9\n\nThis condition involves fluid accumulating slowly between the two layers of the pericardium without necessarily leading to cardiac tamponade. Symptoms may include chest pain, lightheadedness and shortness of breath. 9 11 Large, persistent pericardial effusions may be drained, or the condition may be treated with one of the following interventions: 4 Balloon pericardiotomy: Where a balloon-tipped catheter (thin tube) is used to create a hole in the pericardium to drain the fluid. 12 Surgical pericardial window: Where a small part of the pericardium is opened to drain the fluid. Also known as a subxiphoid pericardiostomy. 13 Sclerosis of the pericardial sac with tetracycline or other substances: This is the administration of a substance to stiffen the tissue, so that the two layers can stick together. Doing this can help prevent a build-up of fluid. 14",
    "cardiac_tamponade": "This is a rare but life-threatening possible complication of pericarditis, where fluid builds up in the pericardium and exerts pressure on the heart, compromising its ability to function. Cardiac tamponade seems to be more common in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis or cancer. Symptoms may develop suddenly (within minutes or hours) and can include: Weakness Faintness Fatigue Nausea Severe shortness of breath Palpitations (the feeling that the heart is skipping a beat or pounding) Confusion Low blood pressure with blurred vision and fainting Loss of consciousness Emergency treatment is essential and typically involves a procedure called pericardiocentesis, where excess fluid in the pericardium is removed via the chest wall using a needle or tube. 2 3 8 9",

    "faqs": "Q: What is effusive-constrictive pericarditis? A: Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is a serious condition in which constrictive pericarditis is present together with pericardial effusion (often with cardiac tamponade). It seems to be more prevalent in cases of pericarditis caused by tuberculosis. Treatment may include pericardiocentesis to relieve pressure on the heart muscle, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, and, in some cases, pericardiectomy. 9 15 16 Q: Can pericarditis be prevented? A: It is not usually possible to prevent pericarditis. However, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of experiencing a repeat episode of pericarditis, chronic pericarditis, or complications from pericarditis. These steps include: 7 Seeking treatment without delay Following the treatment plan (for example, taking colchicine as prescribed) Listening to a doctor’s advice for ongoing medical care"

The average age of perimenopause is 40 to 44, but it can also occur earlier or later in some women. Perimenopause treatment is mainly focused on symptom relief.\n\nPerimenopause is a stage in which women experience a transition from their reproductive age towards menopause . This shift is combined with symptoms of perimenopause and irregularities in the menstrual cycle. Perimenopause can last quite some time and can cause symptoms that can affect everyday activities. Treatment options exist to find relief. In this guide by Ada’s medical team, you can find more information on perimenopause, its stages, symptoms, and treatment options.",
    "what_is_perimenopause": "Perimenopause is the period before menopause , in which you can already start to notice the symptoms of menopause, but you’re still having a period occasionally. As this is a transition time from your reproductive age into your menopause, it’s also often referred to as the menopausal transition. Perimenopause starts when your period first becomes irregular due to a decline in the function of your ovaries and ends a year after you’ve had your last period. 1",
    "stages": "Perimenopause is the stage before menopause. Perimenopause itself can also be divided into different substages, each of which has its characteristics: 2 Very early perimenopause : in this stage, your period is still regular, but you can start noticing some early symptoms such as anxiety, mood changes, and heavier periods Early perimenopause : in this stage, your cycle starts to show some changes, and your period can be about a week later or earlier than usual. Your symptoms can get a bit more noticeable, as your estrogen levels start to fluctuate more. This can lead to perimenopause symptoms such as breast pain, migraines, weight gain, and fatigue. Late perimenopause : as your estrogen levels drop in this stage, you can notice symptoms such as weight gain, fatigue, hot flashes, vaginal dryness and brain fog. After these stages, you’ll reach the end of your perimenopause. Some signs your perimenopause is ending can be that you haven’t had your period for quite some time and that you notice symptoms of perimenopause. Your symptoms should decrease once a year has passed since you’ve last had your period.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of perimenopause are caused by the hormonal changes in your body and can be noticed both physically and mentally. Some common signs of perimenopause are: 3 4 Hot flushes: a feeling of sudden heat in the face, neck or chest Night sweats Palpitations Changes in menstruation Vaginal dryness Painful breasts Painful intercourse Reduced sex drive Painful joints and muscles Changes to your body composition Having dry and itchy skin Recurrent urinary tract infections Incontinence Difficulty sleeping Headaches Changes in mood Memory problems Depression Anxiety Perimenopause symptoms can vary in nature and intensity , making the transition something very personal. Some women almost do not experience any perimenopause signs, while others may experience severe symptoms that affect their quality of life.",
    "causes": "Perimenopause is a natural process that happens when women grow older, as the ovaries start to lose their function and stop releasing eggs that can be fertilized . This causes changes to your hormones, which can cause irregular menstrual cycles and eventually a complete stop of your menstruation. 5",
    "how_long_does_perimenopause_last": "The duration of perimenopause can vary from woman to woman. Perimenopause starts once the menstrual cycle of a woman becomes irregular and ends 1 year after the last menstruation. For most women, the average duration of perimenopause is between 3 to 4 years , although for some, it can only take a few months or it can last up to a decade. 1",
    "how_can_perimenopause_be_diagnosed": "The diagnosis of perimenopause can be made based on your age and the symptoms you’re experiencing . Perimenopause tests aren’t required for the diagnosis. However, blood and urine samples can help determine your levels of estradiol , follicle-stimulating hormone , and luteinizing hormone , which typically have different values during menopause. 6",
    "what_treatments_exist_for_perimenopause_symptoms": "Perimenopause treatment is focused on symptom relief and the prevention of complications. Systemic hormonal treatment can help reduce the severity and frequency of the symptoms of menopause. It can also help reduce the risk of complications such as osteoporosis . This therapy can be administered in various forms, such as tablets, sprays, gels, patches, or vaginal rings. Which hormones you need depends on your situation. Hormonal treatment should only be given for a limited amount of time, so it’s essential to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider. 5 Local estrogen therapy can help with urogenital symptoms such as recurrent urinary tract infections, vaginal dryness, and pain during intercourse. It can be used in addition to systemic hormonal treatment. 5 Non-hormonal treatment exists for the treatment of physical symptoms such as hot flashes. Some examples are: 5 Paroxetine Escitalopram Gabapentin Neurokinin B During perimenopause, vitamin supplements may help relieve your symptoms. Studies show that the best perimenopause supplements are: 5 Vitamin E Omega-3 Milk thistle Perimenopause self-care can consist of making lifestyle changes such as: 5 Maintaining a healthy weight Cognitive behavioral therapy Wearing breathable clothing Doing exercise",

    "what_is_peripheral_vascular_disease": "Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) , also known as peripheral arterial disease, is a common condition in which there is a slow narrowing and hardening of the blood vessels in the legs . This causes poor blood flow and a lack of oxygen to the feet and legs. Smokers are mainly affected. Other risk factors are diabetes, high blood cholesterol, and high blood pressure. Typical PVD symptoms are pain, numbness, paleness, burning, and heaviness of the legs. The diagnosis can often be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who has risk factors for developing this condition. Treatment involves some lifestyle changes, getting good control of other medical conditions, and, if symptoms are severe, surgery. If this condition is not actively managed, the ongoing lack of oxygen can cause the tissues in the feet and legs to die, and in the worst case, this may require amputation.",
    "risks": "Peripheral vascular disease is the medical term for blood vessels (arteries) that do not effectively transport blood to the legs. When a tissue (a substance which makes up the body) doesn't get enough blood and oxygen, it is slow to heal after an injury and can eventually die. The most common cause for this is the formation of fatty collections in the blood vessels, which eventually cause narrowing and slow or stop blood flow. These are more likely to form in people who smoke, who do not take enough exercise, and those who have other medical conditions, especially diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels . This condition tends to affect people over 50 years of age and becomes slightly more common with age. Men tend to be more commonly affected than women.",

    "condition": "Plantar Warts",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/plantar-warts/",
    "what_are_plantar_warts": "Plantar warts, sometimes called verrucas, are a type of wart found on the sole of the foot or the toes, most commonly in weight-bearing locations such as the heel. They are a very common type of wart, especially in children, and are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) – a common viral infection of the skin. HPV infections in locations other than the foot are not classed as plantar warts.\n\nHPV is contagious, meaning plantar warts can be passed from person to person, either through direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly through contact with a surface or object that carries the virus. People with weakened immune systems and children are more at risk of developing common warts . In the majority of cases, plantar warts are no cause for concern and will often disappear naturally. Treatment and removal options, however, are available, particularly for cases in which the warts are causing severe pain or discomfort. 1",
    "plantar_warts_symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of plantar warts include: 1 Small, rough, skin-colored, or white lesions on the bottom of the foot, typically around the heel or the underside of the toes Small black dot,s which are sometimes referred to as wart seeds but are actually clotted blood vessels in or around the warts Hard calluses on the sole of the foot, where a plantar wart has been forced to grow inward, below the surface of the skin Pain or discomfort when walking or standing, mostly in or around the affected areas Medical attention should be sought in the following cases: Warts begin to bleed, change colour or cause significant pain Warts recur despite treatment or appear in large groups An individual also has diabetes , HIV / AIDS ) or other immune system disorders Sensation is lost in the affected foot There is uncertainty as to whether a growth is a wart or a different kind of skin condition",
    "what_causes_plantar_warts": "Plantar warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) – an umbrella term for a group of viruses that affect the skin. The virus causes an excess of the protein keratin to develop on the surface of the skin, resulting in warts. 2 3 HPV can cause warts anywhere on the body, however, only warts on the foot are classed as plantar warts. The virus typically enters the skin through small cuts or weak spots in the outermost layer of the skin and can take a number of weeks or months to produce visible warts.\n\nWarts are spread from person to person, sometimes indirectly through objects or surfaces such as: Surfaces around swimming pools Floors of communal changing rooms Shared socks and shoes Shared towels Damaged or wet skin is most susceptible to infection. Children and teenagers are more likely than adults to develop plantar warts. People with weakened immune systems as a result of other conditions are also at an increased risk of contracting HPV.",
    "diagnosing_plantar_warts": "Diagnosing plantar warts will ordinarily involve a doctor or specialist examining the affected area and checking for visible signs and symptoms. In most cases, a person can themselves diagnose these warts at home, and it is rare that any further diagnostic tests will be necessary. 4 However, if the diagnosis is unclear, a doctor may order a skin biopsy. In this minimally invasive procedure, the top layer of the skin growth will be scraped off and sent to a laboratory for testing.",
    "treatment_for_plantar_warts": "Plantar warts will, in the majority of cases, disappear without any treatment – this, however, could take months or years to happen. If the warts are persistent, painful or if they spread, treatment may be recommended to remove them.\n\nHome remedies are available and can be effective in the removal of the warts in some cases. If they prove resistant, however, doctors can recommend further treatment methods. 5 Plantar warts removal methods include: Salicylic acid: This is a strong acid, generally applied as a gel, that gradually dissolves layers of skin from the affected area, eventually resulting in the complete removal of the wart. Though it is available over the counter, prescription varieties tend to be stronger and more effective. As well as peeling away the surface of the warts, salicylic acid may also stimulate the immune system to fight the virus. Cryotherapy: In cryotherapy, a doctor freezes the warts by applying liquid nitrogen. The process results in a blister forming around the wart that can, after around a week, be removed. Repeated sessions may be necessary. The use of salicylic acid and cryotherapy are the most common treatment methods. If these are ineffective, however, others are available. Trichloroacetic acid: This is another strong acid applied by a doctor after the surface of the wart has been shaved off. Immunotherapy: This treatment method involves injecting the warts with antigens that stimulate the immune system into fighting the HPV infection. It may help prevent repeat outbreaks in those with recurring warts. 6 7\n\nIn extreme cases surgical removal may be necessary if the plantar warts do not respond to other methods. Surgical methods of plantar wart removal include: Electrosurgery: Often viewed as a last resort, this surgery involves using an electric needle to burn away the warts. This procedure can often be painful, and there is a risk of scarring. Laser treatment: The effectiveness of laser treatment is disputed and comes with a risk of pain and scarring. It is typically carried out using a pulsed dye laser to cauterize the skin and kill skin tissue to remove the wart",
    "home_remedies_for_plantar_warts": "As plantar warts are generally non-serious, many people attempt to treat the condition at home, before seeking professional medical attention. There are a variety of methods for doing this: 8 Salicylic acid products: A range of non-prescription salicylic acid products, including plasters, gels and rubs, are available from almost all pharmacies. They are not as strong as prescription versions, but work in the same way.  It is usually necessary to apply the products a number of times Liquid nitrogen: Non-prescription liquid nitrogen products are also available from pharmacies. They usually come in the form of a gel or liquid that can be applied to the wart. Apple cider vinegar: One cup of apple cider vinegar can be mixed with water, then applied to the warts using a cotton ball and left for a minimum of 20 minutes. This process may need to be repeated over a number of weeks for benefits to be seen. 9 Duct tape: Although dermatologists aren’t clear on exactly why, or if, this method works, the use of duct tape is a well-known and popular method of plantar warts removal. Simply apply duct tape to the warts and change it every couple of days until the wart is gone. It is recommended that a doctor be consulted before attempting this method. Home remedies can take a significant amount of time to yield results. If they prove ineffective, seeking professional medical advice is advised.",
    "how_to_prevent_plantar_warts": "Plantar warts are common and can be difficult to protect against. However, taking certain preventative measures may help reduce the risk of infection: 10 Covering the feet with shoes or sandals, for example, when using communal areas like swimming pools and locker rooms Washing the feet and hands regularly The HPV vaccine may reduce the risk of developing plantar warts, though this is not guaranteed and may be most effective when administered at a young age Those who have plantar warts should make efforts to prevent the spread of the virus to other parts of the body, as well as to other people. They can: 11 Avoid sharing towels, shoes and socks Cover warts with a plaster when swimming Wear shoes or sandals in communal areas Avoid scratching or unnecessarily touching warts Change socks daily",
    "plantar_warts_faqs": "Q: Do plantar warts have roots or seeds? A: There is a popular misconception that plantar warts have roots or seeds that can grow through the skin and attach to bone. The small red or black dots that have led to this idea are, in fact, clotted blood vessels, not roots. Q: Can plantar warts spread to the hands and fingers? A: The HPV that causes plantar warts can spread to the hands and fingers and cause warts. However, when found on the hands or fingers, these warts are no longer termed plantar warts but palmar warts. To help stop the spread of the virus, avoid unnecessarily touching the affected area and wash the hands thoroughly after any contact. Covering the wart with a plaster may also help. Q: Are plantar warts contagious? A: Yes, the HPV that causes plantar warts is contagious. It can be passed from person to person, as well as indirectly through surfaces or objects. The virus particularly thrives in warm, moist environments, meaning it is commonly contracted in swimming pools or locker rooms. 1 Q: Does duct tape really work to remove plantar warts? A: There is no clear evidence to suggest that the application of duct tape really works to remove plantar warts. However, the method is enduringly popular and does seem to work for some people, despite the science behind this being unclear. If you are considering using this method, consult a doctor beforehand. 7 Q: Can plantar warts be cancerous? A: In the vast majority of cases, plantar warts are harmless and pose no risk of cancer. Certain types of the HPV virus, however, can lead to some cancers. If plantar warts do not respond to treatment and continue to grow, a biopsy should be carried out to check for cancerous cells. 12"

For most people, plaque psoriasis develops in their twenties, although it can appear at other ages as well. 1 2",
    "what_does_plaque_psoriasis_look_like": "Plaque psoriasis symptoms appear on the skin. You may notice: 1 2 Patches of red, thick skin with silvery-white scales on top if you have pale skin. Plaque psoriasis on black skin usually appears as a light to dark brown, ashy, or gray discoloration. This discoloration typically appears on the scalp, trunk, elbows, and knees. Other parts of the body may also be affected. These patches usually appear in a symmetrical pattern on the body. A burning, itchy, or painful sensation Dry, cracked skin that bleeds Thick pitted nails Affected sleep The symptoms of psoriasis can vary and can range from mild to severe.",
    "what_causes_plaque_psoriasis": "The cause of plaque psoriasis is an overactive immune system which affects the skin cells and causes them to become overly active. Due to the fast multiplication of skin cells, certain areas of the skin start appearing thick, scaly, and inflamed. The reason why the immune system is overly active in people with plaque psoriasis is still being studied. Scientists believe that this may be due to genetics and some other factors such as: 1 HIV infections Streptococcal infections The use of medications such as beta-blockers, or anti-malaria medication Smoking Alcohol Stress Obesity Skin injury Plaque psoriasis is not contagious , so you can’t get the condition from somebody else.",
    "how_long_does_plaque_psoriasis_last": "Psoriasis is a chronic condition , meaning that it lasts for a long time. People affected by this condition often have flare-ups of symptoms for the rest of their lives. This means that the symptoms can come and go . In order to reduce the amount of flare-ups, it is important to avoid what triggers plaque psoriasis in your case. 2",
    "how_can_plaque_psoriasis_be_diagnosed": "Your GP or dermatologist can diagnose plaque psoriasis based on the symptoms you’re experiencing and the appearance of your skin. The condition needs to be distinguished from other conditions that affect the skin in a similar way, such as eczema . In some cases, a small piece of your skin may be collected to examine it under a microscope. 2",
    "how_to_treat_plaque_psoriasis": "Treatment for plaque psoriasis mainly focuses on relieving the symptoms of the condition, as a permanent cure for this condition does not exist. Plaque psoriasis treatment can include: 4 2 5 Creams and ointments such as vitamin D3 analogues (synthetic vitamin D) or topical corticosteroids, are the most common treatments for mild plaque psoriasis. Phototherapy can be used when the creams don’t have the desired effect or when you have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This type of therapy exposes the skin to ultraviolet light and can be effective for plaque psoriasis on the nails, the skin, and the scalp. Plaque psoriasis medication can be prescribed in more severe cases and can be taken orally or by means of an injection. Some examples of medication for plaque psoriasis are Apremilast, Cyclosporine, Acitretin or Methotrexate.",
    "what_are_the_dangers": "In some cases, plaque psoriasis causes a condition called psoriatic arthritis . This happens when psoriasis also affects the joints, causing them to be swollen, stiff, and painful. Other conditions have also been linked to plaque psoriasis . These include: Cardiovascular disease Crohn’s disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Sleep disorders Kidney disease Metabolic syndrome Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Mental health issues and low self-esteem",
    "wrapping_up": "Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis. It causes thick patches of skin with silvery-white scales on top. These patches often appear red on pale skin, but may look light to dark brown, ashy, or gray on Black skin. The affected areas can feel itchy or painful. Although plaque psoriasis cannot be cured, its symptoms can be managed with creams, ointments, phototherapy, and medication.",
    "plaque_psoriasis_faqs": "Q: How do you get plaque psoriasis? A: You can get plaque psoriasis due to an issue with your immune system. Certain factors can trigger the development of symptoms, such as viral infections, the use of certain medications, smoking, alcohol, stress, obesity, and skin injury. Q: Does plaque psoriasis spread? A: Plaque psoriasis is not contagious, so it can not spread from one person to another. The symptoms may appear in different parts of your body, but that is not because the disease is spreading. Q: What is the difference between psoriasis and plaque psoriasis? A: Plaque psoriasis is a subtype of psoriasis that causes thick patches of skin with silvery-white scales on top. These patches often appear red on lighter skin, but may look purple, dark brown, or gray on darker skin tones. It is the most common form of psoriasis. Q: Is plaque psoriasis painful? A: Plaque psoriasis can be itchy and painful when you have a flare-up of symptoms. By avoiding your triggers and receiving the appropriate treatment, you can relieve your symptoms and prevent flare-ups. Q: Is plaque psoriasis hereditary? A: There appears to be a genetic component to plaque psoriasis, as it often runs in families. However, the exact genes involved are still being studied. The condition can also be triggered by various factors such as stress, physical injury, or the use of certain medications."

    "condition": "Pneumonia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/pneumonia/",
    "what_is_pneumonia": "Pneumonia is an infection of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, which inflames them and causes them to fill with fluid or pus. This interferes with the lungs’ ability to breathe and properly supply oxygen to the body, causing symptoms ranging from coughing, fever, and shortness of breath to more severe ones. The infection causes inflammation which can affect the tissue in several areas, including: The bronchi in the lungs, called bronchial pneumonia (bronchopneumonia) One or more segments of the lungs (segmental pneumonia) The tissue between the alveoli (interstitial pneumonia)",
    "types": "There are over 30 different causes of pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and chemicals. 1 The cause affects the symptoms and treatment of the condition. Pneumonia is also described according to where it was acquired, with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) considered more serious than community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) because of the possibility of infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a hospital setting.\n\nMost often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), bacterial pneumonia occurs when bacteria that live in the throat are able to enter the lungs while the body is weakened due to factors such as advanced age, illness, general poor health or a compromised immune system. 2 Other pneumonia-causing bacteria include Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae).\n\nAlso known as Taiwan acute respiratory agent (TWAR), Chlamydia pneumoniae is another bacteria that can cause bacterial pneumonia. Chlamydia pneumoniae symptoms may include laryngitis , unlike typical bacterial pneumonia. 3\n\nThe same viruses that cause a cold or flu can move from the upper respiratory tract to the lungs and cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia typically lasts for a shorter duration than bacterial pneumonia.\n\nSometimes called atypical pneumonia, walking pneumonia is most often caused by the microorganism Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae). Differentiating it from typical pneumonia, walking pneumonia has less severe symptoms and often does not require bed rest. People with walking pneumonia  may, in some cases, confuse the condition with a common cold and continue to go about their normal routine. These people continue to be infectious, though, for as long as 10 days. Walking pneumonia sometimes occurs alongside a skin rash, anemia , or an ear infection , and can affect people of all ages. 4\n\nInhaling harmful substances and chemicals in dust, gas or liquid form can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs. Inhaling secretions from the stomach or mouth, or substances such as vomit or food, can cause aspiration pneumonia, which inflames the lungs due to irritation from the digestive juices and can lead to bacterial pneumonia. 5 Aspiration pneumonia is more common when the person’s gag reflex has already been impaired, such as in cases of drug or alcohol abuse, brain injury or trouble swallowing. These pneumonias vary greatly in severity due to differences in substances and other factors of exposure.\n\nInhaling fungi in bird droppings or soil can lead to pneumonia, particularly among people with a weakened immune system. For this reason, infection with the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, or PCP) can be among the first signs of HIV infection . 6",
    "pneumonia_symptoms": "As pneumonia ranges in severity from mild to life-threatening and can be caused by numerous factors, there are also a wide range of symptoms. The most common symptoms of bacterial and viral pneumonia include: Fever, chills, or cold sweats Coughing that may or may not produce yellow, green or bloody mucus (phlegm) Fatigue Shortness of breath Chest pain that increases with deep breaths Rapid pulse Fast breathing Heavy perspiration Confusion Bluish lips or fingernails In viral pneumonia, these symptoms may worsen to include: Headache Muscle aches Weakness More severe cough and difficulty breathing 1",
    "pneumonia_in_children": "When pneumonia occurs in a child younger than 10 years of age, it is called pediatric or childhood pneumonia . Viruses are more likely than bacteria to cause pneumonia in children under five years of age, and children are also more likely than adults to contract walking pneumonia, largely due to opportunities for the disease to break out at locations such as schools and summer camps. Most cases of childhood pneumonia are not serious, and children with pneumonia may exhibit more subtle symptoms and be less likely to have high fevers. As it is more difficult to notice pneumonia symptoms in infants, parents should be vigilant if their child vomits, appears to feel ill, is limp, pale or restless or cries more than usual. Bacterial pneumonia tends to be more serious, but is more common among older children. 7\n\nJust as with adults, when a child’s immune system is compromised for reasons including recent hospitalization, asthma or chronic illness, they are at greater risk of contracting pneumonia. Children who have not received the full course of childhood vaccinations or PCV13 (Prevnar) are more likely to contract pneumonia.",
    "pneumonia_in_older_people": "People older than 65 are at greater risk of pneumonia and are more likely to develop a more serious infection. People in hospitals or nursing homes are more likely to be exposed to microorganisms that can result in developing hospital acquired pneumonia, and many conditions that older people are more likely to have, such as diabetes , heart disease and lung disease, are linked to pneumonia – though it is unclear whether addressing these issues directly lessens a person’s chance of developing pneumonia. 8",
    "risk_factors_for_pneumonia": "Anyone can get pneumonia at any age, but people who are younger than two or older than 65 are at the highest risk. Also at risk are people in a weakened state of health due to illness, poor nutrition, or a compromised immune system from conditions such as asthma , HIV/AIDS , lymphoma, diabetes, leukemia, or heart disease. Smokers and people who abuse alcohol are also more likely to get pneumonia. Along with these health issues, people who are hospitalized, particularly if they are using a machine for respiratory support (ventilator), are at risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia. People undergoing chemotherapy, organ donors and recipients, or people on long-term steroids can have a weakened immune system that makes them more susceptible. 9 Enter your symptoms in the Ada app and begin your personal health assessment.",
    "pneumonia_diagnosis": "The first step in diagnosing pneumonia is a physical examination, in which a doctor will check for rapid breathing and a blue or purple tint to the lips, fingernails or hands, which can indicate low levels of blood oxygen. As part of this check, they will use pulse oximetry to test for oxygenation in the blood, using a sensor clipped to a finger. They will also listen to the chest using a stethoscope to check for unusual noises, such as a crackling sound. The next step is typically a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis, and this confirmation may give the doctor enough information to begin treatment. 10 Depending on the symptoms and their severity, though, the doctor may request further testing including: Blood tests to check for the presence, type or spread of infection, as well as the level of oxygen in the blood. Sputum test to culture a sample of material coughed up from the lungs to check for infection or identify the microorganism responsible. Chest CT scan to provide similar information about the presence of infection inside of the lungs as an X-ray, but in greater detail by combining computer imaging and X-ray technology. Bronchoscopy to visually inspect the bronchi – the main pathways of the lungs – to evaluate the extent of the infection, as well as to take samples of tissue and fluid, using a camera attached to a flexible tube that is threaded into the airways. This test is more common in severe cases of pneumonia or if the treatment does not respond to antibiotics. Pleural fluid sample to check fluid between the lungs and the chest wall for infection, using a long, thin needle.",
    "pneumonia_treatment": "Antibiotics may be used to treat bacterial, mycoplasmal and some other types of pneumonia, and antifungal medications may be used for fungal pneumonia. Viral pneumonia cannot be treated with antibiotics, but it usually resolves on its own. 1 Most people recover at home rather than at the hospital. The most common treatment for pneumonia involves supporting the body’s health and immune system, such as improving the affected person’s diet, fluid intake or rest. Other treatments may include lowering the fever or administering oxygen. A younger person might recover from pneumonia in a few days while taking antibiotics, while a person over 60 years of age or who has a chronic health condition might be hospitalized for monitoring and treatment. Some people take over-the-counter-painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). Although some people use cough suppressants, some coughing is necessary to remove built-up fluid and mucus from the lungs and airways.",
    "possible_complications": "Most people treated for pneumonia recover successfully, but, in some cases, it can be a life-threatening condition. People who are very young or over 60 years of age, or who have chronic health conditions, are at greater risk of complications. These can include respiratory failure or its more extreme form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might require a person to be treated with a ventilator or respirator. If the infection enters the bloodstream, sepsis can occur. Sometimes, pneumonia can cause empyema, in which infected packets of pus and fluid collect along or inside the lungs, and may need to be treated with surgery. Pneumonia can worsen some chronic conditions, such as emphysema and congestive heart failure. It can also make some people more likely to have a heart attack. 6 Feeling unwell? Start your free symptom assessment in the Ada app",
    "pneumonia_prevention": "Two vaccines, PCV13 (Prevnar 13) and PPSV23 (Pneumovax) are available in the US to prevent pneumonia. These vaccines cannot prevent all cases of pneumonia, but if a vaccinated person contracts pneumonia, it is likely to be of shorter duration and with fewer complications. Both vaccines are recommended for older people. 11 Children younger than five should receive a series of four vaccinations with PCV13. There is some evidence that zinc supplementation can prevent pneumonia in children. 12 Keeping up-to-date with vaccinations and maintaining overall good health can help older people prevent pneumonia. People with some chronic health conditions may be offered these vaccinations and people between 19-64 years of age who smoke might consider being vaccinated with Pneumovax – though quitting smoking will make them less vulnerable to pneumonia and other infections. A flu shot can be helpful in preventing all types of pneumonia; the body is more likely to be susceptible to pneumonia, and other infections when its immune system is weakened by flu. Anyone can follow basic precautions to prevent pneumonia, including washing their hands regularly to avoid the spread of infection and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, such as eating a healthy diet and getting enough rest and exercise.",
    "pneumonia_faqs": "Q: Is pneumonia contagious? A: Pneumonia itself is not contagious, but the bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that lead to this kind of infection can be communicated from person to person. Therefore, the same precautions that prevent the spread of cold and flu can also help prevent transmission of pneumonia. Q: Which population groups should ensure that they are vaccinated against pneumonia? A: As a matter of course, all children younger than five should receive a series of four vaccinations with PCV13 (Prevnar 13). It is recommended that adults be vaccinated against pneumonia if they meet one or more of the following criteria: Are over 65 Use tobacco products (in particular, products which involve smoking) Are affected by alcohol addiction Have, or have had, cochlear implants or cerebrospinal fluid leaks Are affected by ongoing conditions, such as diabetes , diseases of the heart, lungs, spleen or kidneys, or conditions with compromise the function of the immune system, such as HIV. Q: What are the differences between pneumonia and double pneumonia? A: It is possible to be affected by pneumonia in one or both lungs. Double pneumonia is a term used to refer to cases where both of a person’s lungs are infected. It is a common misconception that double pneumonia is more severe than pneumonia which relates to one lung. In fact, it is equally possible to be affected by a mild infection in both lungs, as it is for a severe infection to affect one lung. The potential causes, symptoms, risk factors, and treatment options for pneumonia are the same whether it is double or not. Always seek medical attention promptly if pneumonia is suspected."

    "condition": "Pneumothorax",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/pneumothorax/",
    "what_is_a_pneumothorax": "A pneumothorax , also sometimes referred to as a collapsed lung or punctured lung , is defined as the presence of air or other gas in the chest between the outside of the lungs and the inside of the chest wall. 1 The lungs and the inside of the chest wall have a smooth lining known as the pleura , which allows the lungs to expand without chafing on the chest wall. Usually, the two layers of pleura have only a small space between them, known as the pleural cavity, filled with lubricating fluid. A pneumothorax occurs when air enters this space due to damage . 2 This air buildup leads to increased pressure on the affected lung and prevents it from being able to expand fully. 3 A pneumothorax usually occurs on one side of the chest , so most often leads to one of the lungs being affected. Signs of a pneumothorax vary depending on the amount of lung area affected . While a small pneumothorax may sometimes be asymptomatic, i.e. not produce any symptoms, normally symptoms are experienced. 1 They include a sudden, sharp chest pain, followed by shortness of breath, which may also be severe. An X-ray may be used to confirm the diagnosis .\n\nA pneumothorax can sometimes occur without any particular cause. In such cases, it is called a spontaneous pneumothorax. This occurs especially often in young, lean, and tall men and is much more likely in heavy smokers . 1 Other pneumothorax causes include injury to the chest, lung disease, being on a breathing machine, surgery to the chest or abdomen, or a blocked airway. 4 A small pneumothorax may occasionally not need any particular treatment, but a larger pneumothorax may need to have the air let out to help improve breathing and to allow the lung to expand again. This condition can lead to problems that may be life-threatening. However, with proper treatment, most people recover from a pneumothorax without any substantial long-term problems.",
    "pneumothorax_symptoms": "The most common pneumothorax symptoms are: 5 6 A sudden, sharp stabbing pain on one side of the chest, usually made worse by breathing in Shortness of breath Additional symptoms may include: 5 6 A feeling of tightness in the chest A rapid heart rate Rapid breathing Feeling physically weak Anxiety Confusion Blue fingers and lips Possibly collapse Other symptoms may be present if a lung infection is the cause. These may include: 5 A cough A high temperature or fever",
    "what_causes_a_pneumothorax": "A pneumothorax is the presence of air between the two thin layers of membrane, known as the pleura, that cover the lungs and also line the inside of the chest wall , resulting in the collapse of one or even both lungs. Normally, the pressure in the pleural space is lower than that of the atmosphere or inside the lungs. If there is a cut or tear that makes a connection between the pleural space and the inside of the lungs or the atmosphere, then air will enter the pleural space. This continues until the pressure equalizes or the connection closes. Air in the pleural space causes the lung to collapse partially or fully, leading to this lung or part of the lung being non-functional, causing shortness of breath. Pneumothorax causes may include: 7 8 An injury to the chest, which could be from blunt force or from something penetrating the chest An underlying lung condition or lung infection An invasive medical procedure on the chest or abdomen Being on a breathing machine/ventilator due to treatment in hospital or a long-term care facility",
    "types": "There are two main types of pneumothorax: 1. Traumatic pneumothorax: This can be caused by an injury from blunt force or a penetrating object, or an invasive medical procedure, such as a lung biopsy. 9\n\n2. Spontaneous pneumothorax: Occurs without preceding injury, often without clear reason, but sometimes as a result of lung disease. It is usually due to a tiny tear in the lung, often at the site of a tiny balloon of tissue, known as a bleb or, if bigger, a bulla, that can develop on the edge of a lung. The bleb or bulla wall is not as strong as other lung tissue, so it is more likely to tear.\n\nThis is the most common type of spontaneous pneumothorax. It develops for no clear reason in an otherwise healthy person. Symptoms in PSP may be minimal or even absent. Risk factors for a primary spontaneous pneumothorax include: 10 11 Being tall and thin, because of stretching of the body tissues Gender: Pneumothoraces occur more often in men Age: If a man, being in one’s 20s or, if a woman, being in one’s early 30s Family history of pneumothorax Smoking tobacco A previous pneumothorax Women with thoracic endometriosis , a rare form of endometriosis, where endometrial tissue is found in the lung and/or pleura Certain rare genetic conditions, such as Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome\n\nThis develops as a complication of an existing lung disease, particularly those which weaken the edge of the lung, making it more likely to tear. Symptoms are normally more severe in SSP, even if the pneumothorax is relatively small in size: Due to pre-existing chronic lung disease, the lungs tend to have less reserve, i.e. less volume of air that they can inhale and exhale, when breathing to the limit of capacity in times of stress. Risk factors for a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax include: 5 12 Emphysema Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Asthma Pneumonia Tuberculosis Sarcoidosis, a rare condition that causes small patches of red and swollen tissue, usually in the lungs and skin Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a condition in which tissues in the lung become thick and scarred over time Cystic fibrosis Lung cancer\n\nClosed pneumothorax is caused by blunt trauma, such as in a car accident in which the thorax is impacted by the steering wheel. Air enters through a hole in the lung itself. 13\n\nOpen pneumothorax, also known as a sucking chest wound, may occur after a penetrative injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound, when there is an unsealed opening in the chest wall. This causes air to flow into the lungs through the normal breathing mechanism and simultaneously into the pleural space through the opening in the chest wall. This open pneumothorax may then lead to collapse of the affected side of the lung, with ventilation being practically eliminated on the affected side. 14 Good to know: iatrogenic pneumothorax is an injury that occurs as a complication of medical or surgical procedures in the lung area, such as fitting a pacemaker or central venous line insertion, a lung biopsy, or CPR. Some cases of iatrogenic pneumothorax are not very serious and do not require treatment, while others can lead to serious cases that may require emergency treatment.",
    "complications": "In many cases, a pneumothorax  responds well to treatment or may even resolve on its own, healing from within a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the cause and the severity of the pneumothorax. In some cases, more serious complications can occur.\n\nIn most cases of pneumothorax, some air can move in and out through the tear in the lung or chest wall. In some cases, more likely when a person is affected by open pneumothorax from penetrating chest injuries – though this is also possible in other forms of pneumothorax – air can move into the chest cavity, but not out, leading to a buildup of pressure inside the pocket of trapped air. This is known as a tension pneumothorax. This can lead to compression of the neighboring lung and even push the heart and major blood vessels to the other side of the chest, which may lead to cardiac failure. A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency. If suspected, medical attention should be sought immediately, and the person affected should be transported to a hospital in the quickest possible way, e.g. in an ambulance. The classic signs of a tension pneumothorax include: 16 17 Chest pain Rapid heart rate Low blood pressure Rapid, distressed breathing Severe difficulty breathing An overly expanded chest that moves very little with breathing The risk of tension pneumothorax is increased in the case of: 18 19 Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, where there is underlying lung disease People who are on artificial/mechanical ventilation, where spontaneous breathing is assisted or replaced Pneumothorax as a result of trauma, especially penetrating trauma, such as a knife stab wound People who have been resuscitated after stopping breathing or after the heart stops working Blocked, clamped or displaced chest drains, normally used to allow draining of air, blood or fluid out of the pleural space People undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy, a treatment for decompression sickness, a hazard of scuba diving\n\nSome people who have had one pneumothorax may have another, usually within one to two years of the first. Causes of recurrent pneumothorax may include: 20 Rupture of further blebs Continued air leakage on the site of a previous pneumothorax To reduce the possibility of blebs and recurrence of pneumothorax a person may: 21 Stop smoking tobacco products, if they do so Avoid air travel, until a doctor says it is okay to do so Avoid diving, until a doctor says it okay to do so",
    "diagnosis": "A doctor may suspect a pneumothorax if a person suddenly develops shortness of breath or chest pain, especially after trauma to the chest. They may ask about the affected person’s medical history, including any previous or current smoking habits, and they may carry out a physical examination. Tests to confirm diagnosis may include: 19 22\n\nA chest X-ray (CXR) is often the best and quickest way to confirm the presence of a pneumothorax, which will appear on the X-ray as a darker area on the chest, representing the additional air in the chest cavity.\n\nIn cases where there is doubt about the location or presence of a pneumothorax or for people with extensive lung disease, a CT scan may be used to find a small collapsed area of a lung.\n\nA doctor may also measure the oxygen level in the blood with a handheld device called a pulse oximeter, or they may draw blood from the wrist to directly measure the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the arterial blood, i.e. blood that has just passed through the lungs. While this alone does not normally allow for a diagnosis, it helps to determine how severely affected the person is and may help in determining treatment options.",
    "pneumothorax_treatment": "Pneumothorax treatment depends on the size of the air collection in the chest and the severity of the symptoms. A small pneumothorax may not require any particular treatment, as it may resolve on its own. People with more severe symptoms need emergency treatment . This may involve: 5 23\n\nIf the affected person is breathless, due to a larger pneumothorax or other lung or breathing problems, then the trapped air may need to be removed via a process known as needle decompression or needle aspiration. This involves putting in a chest tube, inserted with the aid of a needle, after locally anesthetizing the area used for access. This tube then helps to release the trapped air: A person may then need to stay in hospital for a day or more for observation, to make sure the affected lung is inflating properly once again and is not at risk of collapsing again. The hospital stay time will depend on the injury, general condition of the affected person  and any other medical conditions present. In the case of tension pneumothorax, decompression is done as a matter of urgency.Some cases of pneumothorax may need to be treated by a  tube remaining in place for a few days and applying continued suction, for example if there are frequent recurrences within a short time.\n\nSometimes pneumothorax happens again spontaneously. A person who has had repeated episodes of pneumothorax may be recommended surgery to prevent the condition from coming back again. It may also be recommended to anyone who has had a tension pneumothorax. 23 A lung specialist will be able to advise on the pros and cons of each procedure, according to each individual case of a pneumothorax. Pneumothorax surgery may include:\n\nThis is an operation to help stick the two membranes, known as pleura, that surround the lung back together. This may be done in two ways: Under local anesthetic, while the person is awake, through a chest drain tube Under general anesthesia, with the person fully asleep, using keyhole surgery Pleural abrasion is a type of pleurodesis that works by irritating the lung surface. This may be done in two ways: 23 24 Chemical pleurodesis using an irritant powder, such as talc Rubbing with a rough pad, causing inflammation which makes the lung surface stick to the inside of the chest wall\n\nThis is the removal of part of the pleura that surrounds the lung and lines the inner chest cavity, so that the lung sticks to the inside of the chest wall. It may also be combined with the other methods mentioned here. 25\n\nThis is the removal of blebs or bullae, weakened sac-like areas on the lung surface that are more likely to rupture.",
    "pneumothorax_recovery_time": "A very small pneumothorax in a healthy adult may heal within a few days without treatment. Otherwise, recovery generally takes from one to a few weeks.\n\nMeasures to aid recovery time include: 26 Avoiding smoking tobacco Resting Avoiding talking loudly and laughing Breathing exercises if recommended by a doctor Taking a cough suppressant if recommended by a doctor",
    "pneumothorax_in_newborns": "Rarely, pneumothorax can occur in newborn babies when some of the tiny air sacs, known as alveoli, in a baby’s lung become overinflated and burst. Causes of neonatal pneumothorax include: 27 28 Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the most common cause of pneumothorax in a newborn. This is a rare condition that occurs more commonly in babies born extremely premature. In cases of respiratory distress syndrome, the lungs are stiff and lack surfactant, the slippery substance that helps them stay inflated, meaning they are not able to expand as easily. 29\n\nMeconium aspiration syndrome is a condition in which, before or during birth, the baby may breathe in its first bowel movement, which can obstruct the airways and cause breathing problems. The use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a technique that allows newborns to breathe on their own while receiving slightly pressurized oxygen, or a breathing machine is sometimes necessary to support a newborn. The air pressure will be carefully regulated to avoid pneumothorax. However, it can occasionally still occur due to the extra pressure on the baby’s lungs, which can burst the air sacs. Health care providers will watch a baby carefully for any signs of pneumothorax, so that, if it occurs, treatment can be started as quickly as possible. 30 Rarely, other conditions that affect the lungs, such as pediatric pneumonia may also lead to neonatal pneumothorax. Very rarely, even an otherwise healthy infant can develop a pneumothorax when he or she takes the first few breaths after birth, as the pressure needed to expand the lungs for the first time may in very rare cases be enough to cause a rupture. 27 Symptoms of pneumothorax in a newborn may include: 27 28 Fast breathing and grunting Nostril flaring Indrawing of the skin in between each rib and indrawing of the stomach just below the rib cage Chest appears markedly larger on one side than on the other Low oxygen saturation of the blood resulting in bluish skin color Irritability/excessive crying or crying that is different from usual Restlessness Difficulty feeding the baby Neonatal pneumothorax may get better on its own, without treatment. Larger air leaks may require treatment, which can include: 28 30 Supplementing oxygen: The infant is placed inside a small tent, known as an oxygen hood, into which oxygen is pumped. Draining collected air with a syringe or a chest tube: If the newborn’s breathing is labored, or if their blood levels of oxygen decline, trapped air may need to be removed using a needle and syringe or, in more serious cases, using a plastic tube which stays in place temporarily and is removed after a few days. If the pneumothorax is an isolated event and is treated quickly, the prognosis or outcome is normally good. Long-term lung damage is rare. If other trauma was sustained at the same time or tension pneumothorax occurred with subsequent shock and inadequate blood flow to the body tissues, the prognosis may worsen. An affected infant will most likely also need regular follow-up clinic appointments. It is important to adhere closely to the doctor’s recommendations during the stay and when discharged from the hospital. 2",
    "other_names_sometimes_used_for_pneumothorax": "Collapsed lung Punctured lung (A central venous line is a very thin, tube-shaped medical device that runs through the veins to the heart, used by doctors to access the venous system, which transports deoxygenated blood from the body back to the heart, to administer drugs, nutrition, fluids and to monitor blood pressure.)",
    "pneumothorax_faqs": "Q: Atelectasis vs pneumothorax, what is the difference? A: Both a pneumothorax and an atelectasis may commonly be referred to as collapsed lung , however, they are separate conditions. They may both affect one entire lung or only a part of a lung. A pneumothorax leads to collapse of a lung when air escapes from the lung and fills the space between the lung and the chest wall, or air enters the chest from the outside, e.g. after a penetrating injury to the chest. Atelectasis collapse occurs because of a blockage, most often of the lower or smaller branches of the lung air passages, or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Blockages and pressure changes leading to atelectasis may, for instance, be caused by: 32 33 A mucus plug A tumor An inhaled foreign object Lung disease Infection Q: Pneumothorax vs tension pneumothorax, what is the difference? A: Pneumothorax is the accumulation of air between the lungs and the chest walls in the pleural space. In a normal pneumothorax, a certain amount of air enters the pleural space, and then stops accumulating. In a tension pneumothorax, air continues to enter the pleural space as the person breathes and pressure rises inside the chest. This reduces the amount of blood returned to the heart, as the blood cannot force its way against the increased pressure from the tension pneumothorax into the vessels running through the chest and back to the heart. As a result, the heart has less blood to pump through the body and to the brain, possibly resulting in shock. Good to know: A tension pneumothorax is a severe, life-threatening form of pneumothorax requiring immediate medical intervention. These effects may often occur rapidly and need to be resolved as quickly as possible to minimize any harmful effects. 34 Q: Hemothorax vs pneumothorax A: While a pneumothorax is an accumulation of air between the lung and the chest wall in the pleural space, a hemothorax is an accumulation of blood in the pleural space. A hemothorax usually results from injury, blunt or penetrating, that cuts a lung or an artery, or a vein in the chest, but may also occur with chest surgery or bleeding caused by a condition such as lung cancer or tuberculosis. If a large amount of blood pools, it may press on the lungs and make breathing difficult. A pneumothorax can occur together with a hemothorax, which is then known as a hemopneumothorax. 35 Q: Can a pneumothorax heal itself? A: Yes, it is possible for a small pneumothorax to heal on its own without treatment. In such cases, a person may only require oxygen and rest to make a full recovery. However, if pneumothorax is causing considerable breathlessness, it is likely that the trapped air may need to be drained using a needle and syringe or via a chest tube."

    "condition": "Podagra",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/podagra/",
    "what_is_podagra": "Podagra, which in Greek translates to ‘foot trap,’ is gout, which affects the joint located between the foot and the big toe, the metatarsophalangeal joint. Gout, also known as gouty arthritis, results in recurrent, acute attacks of joint inflammation. A person with joint inflammation experiences pain, swelling, and heat in the affected area. Podagra and gout inflammation is normally caused by hyperuricemia, chronically high levels of uric acid in the blood, which can cause small urate crystals to form in and around the joints.\n\nGout tends to start in one joint, often that of the big toe, before spreading to others. Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases. 1 Certain foods, especially red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys, as well as many oily fish, drinking alcohol, and conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity may lead to the production of higher than normal levels of urate – a salt of uric acid – in the body. Gout mainly affects people over 30 years old and tends to affect more men than women.",
    "podagra_symptoms": "Podagra causes severe pain in the metatarsophalangeal joint, which is the joint at the base of the big toe. The onset of gout symptoms in the big toe is characterized by intense attacks of pain, usually sudden and often at night. It is not clear how, but even without treatment, the body normally resolves a gout flare on its own. Untreated attacks normally last about 5-10 days, though the pain is most severe in the first 12-24 hours, after which time it usually improves over a few days to several weeks. The most common podagra flare symptoms result from inflammation localized in the big toe joint, including: 2 3 Severe pain Swelling Redness Sensation of heat Difficulty moving the joint Less common symptoms of a gout attack include: 2 3 Tophi: uric acid crystal deposits appearing as firm, yellowish nodules on the joint Fever Fatigue Without preventive measures, the average time between the first attack and a recurrence is about one year, though podagra may recur much sooner, or it may never happen again. Subsequent attacks of podagra may last longer than the initial one. They may lead to damage in the metatarsophalangeal joint, with difficulty walking becoming permanent in some cases. In cases of chronic gout, also known as chronic gouty arthritis, a person may experience symptoms of inflammation most or all of the time.",
    "what_causes_podagra": "Podagra is a manifestation of gout, in which uric acid crystallizes and settles in one or more joints. This is often caused either by excess amounts of uric acid being produced, or not enough being excreted from the urine on a chronic basis. Any abrupt increase in the level of uric acid in the blood may also trigger an attack of podagra or gout. Certain foods, especially red meat or organ meats such as liver or kidneys, as well as oily fish, drinking alcohol and certain conditions, such as high blood pressure or obesity, may lead to the production of higher-than-healthy levels of uric acid. Most people with elevated blood levels of uric acid will never develop podagra and gout, and gout is not always associated with elevated uric acid blood levels. The condition can also occur despite there being normal levels of uric acid at the point in time when blood levels are measured. Podagra is thought to develop due to an immune response. White blood cells and joint-lining cells may attempt to surround and digest urate crystal deposits. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the inflammation that is characteristic of podagra specifically and gout in general. Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, as in podagra. This joint is where there tends to be increased impact from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Uric acid crystals are also less soluble under acidic conditions and in cooler body parts further away from the torso, such as are found in the big toe and other joints of the hands and feet. 1 4 Attacks of podagra tend to happen at night and are thought to be made more likely by a lower nocturnal body temperature.",
    "podagra_gout_risk_factors": "There are many medical conditions and lifestyle factors that may increase the risk of developing podagra and gout, including: 1 5 Being a man older than about 30 Being a woman who has experienced menopause Regularly drinking excessive amounts of alcohol , especially rum, whisky, vodka, gin and beer Eating large amounts of red meat or organ meats, such as liver or kidneys, or certain oily fish such as anchovies or trout Eating too many protein-rich foods Consuming large amounts of fructose, such as in beverages containing high fructose corn syrup Taking medications that alter urate blood levels, especially diuretics, such as for heart failure or high blood pressure Diabetes Obesity Fasting Kidney disease, especially chronic kidney disease Some rare medical conditions may increase the risk of developing gout in general and podagra as a special form of gout, such as conditions which result in: 5 High cell turnover: This may be caused by certain autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis , a scaly skin condition, or as a side effect of certain medications, such as with tumor lysis syndrome, in which large amounts of tumor cells are killed off by treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. Enzyme defects: This may be caused by certain genetic disorders that cause disordered processing of uric acid, such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, also known as juvenile gout. In people who have had a gout flare-up, there are factors that may increase the risk of recurrence, including: 5 Injury to the foot Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Fasting or overeating protein-rich foods Taking medications that alter urate blood levels.",
    "how_to_diagnose_podagra_foot_gout": "There are many conditions that may cause joint inflammation. Podagra is suspected if risk factors are present, and a person has an acute attack of pain in the joint of the big toe. The most definitive way for a doctor to make a diagnosis of gout and podagra is by taking a sample of fluid from a swollen joint to look for evidence of gout crystals in the joint. A needle and syringe are used to withdraw a small amount of joint fluid. Tophaceous gout – chronic gout in which hard lumps made of uric acid crystals, known as tophi, form around a joint – may be diagnosed by sampling the tophi, which are located right beneath the skin. If joint fluid analysis is not possible, a tentative diagnosis may be made based on the person's medical history, symptoms, a physical examination, and urine and blood tests to assess uric acid levels. The Ada app can also offer a free assessment of your symptoms. 7\n\nBlood tests may also be analyzed for other indicators of gout or factors that may increase its likelihood, such as levels of white blood cells , triglycerides , high-density lipoproteins, glucose, as well as renal and liver function (see blood test results) . Ultrasound scans or X-rays of the affected joint may be helpful to look for signs of damage as a result of persistent gout. 8 9",
    "podagra_treatment": "Podagra treatment may consist only of short-term treatment to shorten and lessen the symptoms of a podagra attack. Lifestyle interventions may be recommended, if applicable. In cases of recurrent attacks, longer-term management may be needed to prevent further attacks and permanent damage to the joints.\n\nIn the case of a first attack, or if a person experiences attacks less than twice a year without tophi or very high uric acid levels, podagra and gout treatment is usually limited to the duration of an attack by using medication to relieve pain and inflammation. A doctor may prescribe medication to keep on hand for use in the event of a future attack. Which medication and dose to use is determined based on a number of factors, includings kidney health, ulcer history and the person’s risk of bleeding. Possible medications include: 10 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs such as ibuprofen are effective when used as early as possible in a podagra attack and when taken in higher doses to achieve anti-inflammatory, not just pain-relieving properties. A doctor will be able to recommend the appropriate type and dose. Colchicine: This may be prescribed in pill form for those who cannot tolerate NSAIDs. Colchicine seems to be most effective when started within the first 24 hours of an attack. Glucocorticoids: These may be given orally, by injection into the joint, or occasionally by intravenous (IV) or intramuscular injection.\n\nIt is also recommended to rest the affected foot as much as possible by avoiding walking or using a cane or splint to avoid putting weight on the foot. The swelling may also be brought down by elevating the foot and keeping it cool with an ice pack for 20 minutes at a time.\n\nPodagra may become chronic, in which there are repeated episodes of pain and inflammation, which may also spread to multiple joints and lead to joint damage and disability. Treatment for gout typically includes a uric-acid-lowering regimen. This aims to prevent or reverse the crystal deposits that lead to and worsen chronic gout.\n\nPeople with more than two gouty attacks per year, joint damage as seen on a radiograph, or uric acid crystals known as tophi, among others, may be given uric acid-lowering medication, such as allopurinol. 7\n\nDuring the first six months of uric acid-lowering medication, medication to reduce inflammation may be provided. This is because uric acid-lowering medications change serum and tissue uric acid levels, and so may trigger acute attacks of podagra and gout. Medication to treat swelling and pain, as well as to lessen any damage caused by podagra attacks may include: 2 NSAIDs are sometimes given for daily use, and have an advantage for people who also have osteoarthritis. This decreases swelling and potential joint damage. Colchicine may be given at a low dose to prevent gastrointestinal side effects which may occur at higher doses of NSAID use. Colchicine works by decreasing swelling and lessening the buildup of uric acid crystals.\n\nLifestyle changes may also be helpful in the management of gout and podagra. These include: 8 Losing weight, if overweight: Can greatly reduce urate levels. Should be combined with regular exercise. Rapid weight loss should be avoided, as this can raise urate levels. Drinking plenty of water: Can reduce the risk of uric acid crystals forming in the joints. Sugary drinks should be avoided, as high levels of fructose are likely to increase blood urate levels. Avoiding excessive alcohol consumption: Beer and spirits are especially likely to increase urate levels. Close management of blood pressure and diabetes management, if appropriate. Maintaining a healthy diet: Foods rich in purines, chemical compounds made naturally by the body, but also found in high levels in certain foods, may worsen podagra and gout. Foods to be avoided include red meat, organ meats and certain oily fish, such as anchovies or mackerel. Plenty of vitamin C-rich fruit and vegetables should be eaten, as they help the kidneys to remove urate.",

    "podagra_faqs": "Q: Why does gout target the big toe? A: Podagra is the first joint manifestation in about half of all cases of gout, and is eventually seen in about 90 percent of cases. Uric acid crystals tend to settle in the big toe, where there is normally increased stress from walking and supporting the weight of the body. Furthermore, these crystals are also less soluble under acid conditions and at the cooler joints in the extremities, such as the big toe. Q: What does a podagra attack feel like? A: Podagra typically comes on suddenly, often within a few hours and often at night, thought to be because this is when the body temperature lowers. The toe or foot becomes swollen, red, hot, and can be very painful. Sometimes a person will also experience fever and fatigue. The attack usually gets better within three days, but may not completely resolve for several weeks. Q: Is heat good for gout? A: Yes, a warm compress may help lessen pain. It may be left on for three minutes, wrapped in a towel to prevent burns, and then followed by a cold compress for thirty seconds, repeated every hour as long as needed. However, hot weather can trigger a gout attack. This is because a person is more likely to become dehydrated in hot weather, which can raise uric acid levels rapidly.

    "what_is_a_poliovirus_infection": "Poliovirus infection is a infectious condition caused by the poliovirus. This virus infects the nervous system and may lead to muscle weakness or paralysis (inability to move muscles at all). This condition is very uncommon as immunization has caused the virus to be eradicated from many countries. People who are not immunized against polio and who travel to areas where the poliovirus is still active have a risk of getting a polio infection. Children under 5 years of age are most commonly affected. Polio symptoms may include: fever sore throat headaches aching muscles. Some, but not all, people go on to develop muscle weakness. Poliovirus infection cannot be cured and the treatment usually only controls the symptoms. The outlook after a poliovirus infection depends on the severity of the symptoms, but it can cause permanent disability and death. Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your symptom assessment in the free Ada app .",
    "risks": "Polio is caused by the polio virus. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with an infected person or through infected mucus and feces. Although this virus has been removed from most countries in the world, episodes or outbreak of polio still occur. Outbreaks tend to occur more commonly in the summer months. Although people of any age group can become infected, children under the age of 5 years are most commonly affected. The people who are not vaccinated against polio and who travel to areas where poliovirus is still active are at risk of getting infected.",
    "symptoms": "Early symptoms of a poliovirus infection resemble the flu and include fever, headache, vomiting, feeling ill and sore throat. These symptoms will often get better within a few days, and most people will have no further symptoms. If the virus spreads to the nervous system, it can cause muscle weakness in the legs, arms, back or neck. This can cause problems walking and completing tasks, and even difficulty breathing. Over time, this causes tight joints, shrinking of the muscles (atrophy) or even paralysis. Symptoms may come back years after the original infection, causing the post-polio syndrome .",
    "diagnosing_polio_infection": "The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and physical examination when it is known that a person is not immunized and has been to an area where they may have been exposed to the virus. Blood tests for immune proteins which fight the poliovirus (antibodies) and a lumbar puncture (taking a sample of fluid from around the spinal cord) are often done to confirm the diagnosis and to investigate for the virus in the nervous system.",
    "polio_infection_treatment": "There is no specific cure for poliovirus infection. Treatment aims to relieve symptoms. This may mean simple pain relief for headaches and muscle aches. People with ongoing muscle weakness may need physical therapy to help improve muscle strength.

    "condition": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/",
    "what_is_polycystic_ovary_syndrome": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects the normal functioning of a woman’s ovaries. The ovaries usually produce ova (eggs) and the hormones estrogen and progesterone . These hormones influence the menstrual cycle and the production and release of eggs from the ovaries. In healthy women, ovulation occurs every month. At this point, the eggs are released into the fallopian tubes. Before this, these eggs develop tiny cysts within, known as follicles. Polycystic ovary syndrome is diagnosed if at least two of the following occur: 1 A minimum of 12 small cysts (follicles) form in the ovaries. These cysts are not big enough to trigger ovulation. The balance of the hormones produced in the ovaries is altered, particularly if the amount of testosterone produced increases. The individual does not ovulate each month or does not ovulate at all. In this case, the affected woman may not have a period. In many cases, affected women will experience all three of these effects. Although PCOS is a relatively common condition, occurring in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women, the exact cause is not known. 2 It is usually diagnosed during adolescence or in young adulthood, and symptoms include irregular or absent periods, excessive hair growth and difficulty falling pregnant. PCOS is a chronic condition with no cure. After menopause, once ovarian function has declined, the symptoms of the condition will typically improve. Before this, treatment is aimed at managing the signs and symptoms and preventing complications. Certain lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, are the most typical treatment methods for adolescent girls and women experiencing the condition. Medication is typically reserved for the occurrence of complaints, such as anovulation, hirsutism and menstrual irregularities.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome include: 2 3 Menstrual irregularity: If ovulation does not occur, women will experience irregular or missed periods. Weight gain: Approximately half of all women with PCOS will experience weight gain that is difficult to manage. Unwanted hair growth: Also called hirsutism, affected areas may include the face, arms, chest and back. Hair loss or thinning: Primarily experienced on the head, normally in middle aged women. Difficulty becoming pregnant : Some women may find it difficult to fall pregnant and may require fertility treatments. Acne: Unwanted acne may develop, as well as other skin disorders such as skin tags, darkened patches of skin, oily skin and excessive sweating. Changeable mood: Some women may experience mood swings, anxiety and/or depression. Pelvic pain Headaches Difficulty sleeping High blood pressure (hypertension) Acanthosis nigricans: Brown or grey, velvety and sometimes verrucous patches of hyperpigmented skin. Usually found over the nape of the neck, the vulva, armpit, groin, navel, submammary areas, elbows and knuckles. Symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome usually begin to occur around the time of puberty, though some women may only develop symptoms in late adolescence or early adulthood. The symptoms experienced and the severity of these symptoms may also vary from woman to woman. People experiencing possible symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome should talk to their doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The exact causes of polycystic ovary syndrome are not clear. There are, however, a number of factors which are thought to play a role. These factors include: 1 4 Insulin production: Produced in the pancreas, insulin is a hormone with the key function of controlling blood sugar levels. In the ovaries, it also helps to produce the male sex hormone testosterone. Women with PCOS have an insulin resistance, meaning that their bodies are not affected by normal levels of insulin in the usual way. This causes their bodies to produce increased amounts of insulin, resulting in unusually elevated levels of testosterone being present in the ovaries. This testosterone interferes with the ability of the follicles in the ovaries to fully develop. Luteinising hormone (LH): Produced in the pituitary gland, luteinising hormone works to help the ovaries to ovulate and assists insulin in the production of testosterone. High levels of the hormone are found in roughly half of all women with PCOS. Weight: Although not a cause of PCOS in itself, being overweight can make insulin resistance worse by causing the the body to produce increased levels of insulin. Genetic factors: It is thought that there may be a hereditary element to PCOS, but the links between genetics and the development of the condition are not yet fully understood.",
    "diagnosis": "Women experiencing symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome should consult a doctor. A doctor will begin a diagnosis by asking questions about the symptoms and checking blood pressure. Following this, a number of tests can be used to confirm a diagnosis. These include: 1 5 Blood tests: Used to measure hormone levels. In women with PCOS, levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH) will typically be elevated. Ultrasound: Used to scan the ovaries for the small cysts typical of PCOS. Before confirming a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, doctors will also need to rule out other conditions that may be responsible for the symptoms, such as premature ovarian failure and Cushing’s syndrome . If a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome is confirmed, individuals may be referred to a specialist: either a gynecologist – a specialist in the female reproductive system – or an endocrinologist – a specialist in conditions relating to hormones. Women who display only minor symptoms of PCOS should be carefully monitored by medical professionals. This is because, characteristically, the condition is known to develop and become more serious over time. 2",
    "treatment": "There is currently no cure for polycystic ovary syndrome. The aim of treatment, therefore, is to manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of complications developing. Treatment typically involves one or more of the following options, depending on the symptoms experienced and the health of the affected woman: Lifestyle changes, particularly weight loss, but also including exercise and the maintenance of a healthy diet Medications\n\nWeight loss is considered to be the most effective method of promoting regular periods and lowering the risk of long-term complications as a result of PCOS . Research suggests that losing as little as five percent of body weight can be enough to achieve this. 2 6 Weight loss is best achieved through regular exercise and healthy dietary choices. Women who wish to lose weight should discuss the best ways of achieving this with their doctor.\n\nMetformin , though not designed specifically for the treatment of PCOS, may be prescribed by doctors to help treat the condition. Metformin helps the body to become more sensitive to insulin, helping to equalize the balance of hormones in women with a hormone imbalance. 7 Metformin should only be used in cases where lifestyle changes fail to help manage the condition and then should be used in combination with lifestyle changes. The first line of treatment for women who are infertile but wish to become pregnant is clomifene, a non-steroidal anti-oestrogen medication that helps to increase FSH secretion, which in turn may lead to follicular menstruation and ovulation. Letrozole , a medication not specifically designed to help with ovulation but which, as some research suggests, can be more effective than clomifene, may also be prescribed in some cases. 2 In women who do not desire to become pregnant, oral contraceptives (OCs, with combined estrogen and progesterone) are commonly prescribed. OCs help to promote regular menstrual periods and can help to reduce excess hair growth and acne . 2 A hormonal substrate named progestin may also be prescribed to help promote regular periods, though this method does not help with acne or hair growth and does not prevent pregnancy. 2",
    "complications": "Women with polycystic ovary syndrome are more likely to develop other conditions, including: 1 Type-2 diabetes Pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preterm delivery High cholesterol levels High blood pressure Being overweight Sleep apnea Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Reduced quality of life These conditions may also increase the risk of developing heart disease and having a stroke later in life. The best way to avoid these potential complications is to effectively manage PCOS. Good to know: PCOS can also increase the risk of miscarriage in those who are pregnant. The best way to minimise this risk is to devise an appropriate antenatal care plan with one’s doctor. Read more about Miscarriage » .",

    "condition": "Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/post-concussion-syndrome/",
    "what_is_post_concussion_syndrome_pcs": "Post- concussion syndrome (PCS), also known as postconcussion syndrome, post concussive syndrome and persistent post concussive syndrome, is a common complication of concussion. Post concussive symptoms are typically similar to those of the initial concussion, but last longer than usual. A concussion is a mild form of traumatic brain injury (MTBI) or mild head injury (MIH), which can result from a blow or bump to the head for example from a fall or a sports injury. Post-concussion syndrome is most likely to affect a person soon after sustaining their minor head injury. Around 50 percent of people who have sustained a concussion will experience symptoms of PCS at one month after the initial injury Around 15 percent of people who have sustained a concussion will continue to experience symptoms of PCS for one year after the initial injury PCS can affect both males and females and can develop following a concussion at any age. When babies , toddlers and older children develop PCS, the range of possible symptoms is slightly different to those experienced by adults. The symptoms of PCS are age-range specific and relate to a person’s stage of brain development. See the sections on PCS in babies and PCS in toddlers and older children for more information. At any age, post-concussive symptoms usually resolve hours or days after the primary injury – i.e. the incident that caused the concussion – with appropriate rest and aftercare. Those who go on to develop PCS will experience similar symptoms to those present in the immediate two-week period following their head injury, such as headaches, dizziness and fatigue. However, in PCS, post-concussive symptoms may persist for weeks, months or even years after the primary injury. 2 Although medical supervision should be sought in all cases, PCS sometimes resolves without the need for specific treatment. 3 If treatment is needed, it typically involves a tailored care plan to address the particular symptoms that a person is experiencing, which may vary considerably between people. A treatment plan for PCS may feature medications and/or psychotherapeutic treatments , such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Most people recover fully from PCS, after around three months of effective treatment. However, recovery can take months or years, depending on the number and severity of a person’s symptoms. Research indicates that the fewer symptoms of PCS a person presents with, the shorter their total recovery time is likely to be. 4 Good to know: This resource specifically provides information on PCS stemming from a regular concussion or mild head injury (MIH), and does not cover the treatment or prognosis for any other forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is important to note that post concussive symptoms may also manifest following other, more serious kinds of TBI than a concussion. If a person has been affected by a TBI that is different from a concussion ‒ even if they experience symptoms that can be present in the immediate aftermath of a concussion and/or can persist on a more long-term basis, as in PCS ‒ they will need treatment suited to their specific injury. This is because, when these symptoms manifest due to other forms of TBI, their associated health implications, recovery times and treatment recommendations may be different to those of PCS. For information on other forms of traumatic brain injury, see these fact-sheets from Headway: the Brain Injury Association.",
    "symptoms": "When post-concussion syndrome develops, at least three of the following cognitive, physical, emotional and behavioural symptoms will be present: 5 6 7 Vestibular symptoms, including dizziness, vertigo, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea and/or balance problems Vision problems, often involving blurred vision, difficulty moving one or both eyes as normal and/or difficulties with focussing or sustaining focus, which can impede activities such as reading Headache, and/or a sense of pressure in the head Hypersensitivity, or exquisite sensitivity; to light (photophobia), noise (phonophobia) and/or other external stimuli, including factors which would not bother a person normally, such as sunlight or background chatter Trouble sleeping, most commonly resulting in insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep wake disorder and/or sleep apnea Fatigue Cognitive difficulties, such as feeling as though one is in a blur or fog, difficulty concentrating, impaired memory, particularly surrounding the circumstances of the primary injury and/or confusion Psychological symptoms, including intolerance to stress, emotion or alcohol, irritable mood and changes in personality, emotional blunting or apathy, and/or disinclination towards activities which they would normally enjoy, including socialising and sexual activity Severe symptoms of concussion in the immediate aftermath of the primary injury can be predictors for developing PCS, but may also indicate that a person has actually sustained a more serious form of TBI requiring specialized aftercare. It is important to monitor anyone who has sustained a blow to the head vigilantly for signs of concussion , which can appear within minutes, hours or days of the causal injury. Seek immediate medical attention in all cases where temporary loss of consciousness is experienced and/or the symptoms of concussion are severe. In adults and teenagers, the symptoms of PCS are similar to those that may be experienced in the hours or days following an MTBI, other than that they have a longer duration, remaining present for over two weeks after the primary injury. One person with PCS may experience an entirely different combination of symptoms to those that affect another. In PCS, it is common to develop symptoms of related psychological conditions, due to the impact of PCS on a person’s quality of life, possibly including: Depression Anxiety Panic attacks or limited-symptom panic attacks Hypochondrial fear of having incurred permanent or severe brain damage A combination of two or more of these findings If you think that you, or a loved one, may be affected by symptoms of any of these conditions, you can get a free assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app . Good to know: It is not uncommon for people affected by PCS to downplay the extent of their symptoms, in particular changes to personality and cognitive defects, such as vision problems, which may be interfering with their ability to go about their daily routine. 5 In some cases, a person may avoid acknowledging these symptoms altogether in order to ignore their impact. This can result in attempting to perform professional and personal obligations despite the problems posed by their symptoms, which can prolong and worsen PCS. It is always recommended that anyone experiencing symptoms of concussion, that persist beyond their expected recovery time, discuss their symptoms with a doctor, even if a person genuinely feels their symptoms to be slight or insignificant. The symptoms that they are experiencing may turn out to relate to a more serious TBI requiring treatment, or to another condition, which can then be diagnosed. Furthermore, if a person’s symptoms are found to relate to PCS, treatments can then be recommended to help a person regain their pre-injury capabilities and quality of life.",
    "causes": "The reasons why some people develop post-concussion syndrome following a concussion and others do not, is currently not fully medically understood. However, certain factors are believed to contribute to developing the condition. These include: Structural damage to the brain. This will be due to the primary brain injury healing more slowly than in cases of regular concussion. A person’s neurotransmitter systems may be disrupted during this time, causing their symptoms of concussion to persist. Psychological factors. In people with a predisposition towards certain other psychological conditions such as depression or anxiety, or who have a pre-existing diagnosis of these conditions, the brain may take longer than normal to recover from concussion, resulting in PCS. Good to know: A certain proportion of cases of PCS are diagnosed due to misattribution. It is normally expected to experience symptoms of PCS following a minor head injury, and it is likely for people and their doctors to believe that any symptoms of PCS experienced following a minor TBI are linked to the injury. In fact, research suggests that some of the symptoms of PCS are almost equally likely to affect people who have not sustained a head injury, due to a wide range of other possible causes. A person who has sustained an injury to the head may therefore be diagnosed with PCS, when the development of their symptoms is, in fact, unrelated to their head injury.\n\nSeveral medical theories could explain the presence of psychological symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, which may accompany PCS: On a psychological level, symptoms of PCS can interfere with a person’s ability to go about their day-to-day routine as normal, causing distress and having a negative impact on their quality of life. On a physiological level, the damage to neurons that may be causing PCS is believed to result in a person processing external stimuli differently from normal. 8 Whereas a healthy brain processes out the irrelevant aspects of their visual landscape and chooses what to focus on, a person with PCS may experience a sensory overload. This can trigger a primal stress response. A person with PCS may take undue notice of elements of their surroundings, such as objects in their peripheral vision. 8 The confusion that this results in can be distressing and make it difficult to perform everyday activities such as driving or grocery shopping. The distress experienced can lead to a stress response, and, for some people, a full or limited-symptom panic attack. See this resource for more information on panic attacks . When a person is treated effectively for PCS, associated symptoms such as the stress response, depression and anxiety will improve too. To treat the psychological symptoms associated with PCS, specific psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be needed.",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_pcs": "Certain population groups are at greater risk of developing PCS from a concussion than the general population, including: Elderly people Women A concussed person is considered to be at greater risk of developing PCS if: They have a history of prior concussion They are affected by severe symptoms of concussion in the hours or days after the causal injury They are not resting the injury appropriately by following their recommended recovery plan A person’s recovery can be compromised and their risk of PCS increased if they do not rest as instructed by their doctor following the primary injury. Not resting the injury appropriately can: Delay the healing process relating to the primary injury Thereby increase the likelihood of developing a secondary TBI , if the person receives another knock to the head whilst the internal damage from the first TBI is still healing Resting appropriately following the injury usually involves avoiding certain activities, such as looking at computer screens and smartphones for prolonged periods, driving or playing certain sports.\n\nResearch indicates that non-compliance with a do-not-return-to-play recommendation is a primary factor, among those who play sports, in persistent PCS. Persistent PCS is post-concussion syndrome which does not get better fully with treatment, after one year or more. Always follow medical advice fully in order to maximise the likelihood of making a full recovery from PCS. 9 Furthermore, repeated head injuries leave a person vulnerable to developing other, more serious conditions, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), in which the function of the brain deteriorates.",
    "diagnosis": "With a view to identifying and diagnosing PCS promptly, the number and intensity of a person’s concussive symptoms should be monitored closely over their recovery period from the initial concussion. Seek medical attention if any symptoms remain present after two weeks. 10 This is the normal timeframe in which people who are not affected by PCS feel themselves to be fully recovered after a concussion. The presence of any symptoms beyond this point may indicate post-concussion syndrome. Diagnosis of post-concussion syndrome will be made by assessing a person’s symptoms on a case-by-case basis. There are no standard diagnostic tests for PCS. Before making a diagnosis of PCS, a doctor will usually perform brain imaging tests, such as a to rule out the possibility that a more serious complication has developed from the concussion. This may include a secondary brain injury, for instance, an intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain) resulting from the body’s inflammatory response to the primary injury. 11 Good to know: Brain imaging tests will also usually be performed when a concussion is initially diagnosed to rule out the possibility that a person is affected by a more serious form of TBI. Most often, PCS develops after a mild TBI, but it is also possible to develop symptoms of the condition after a moderate or severe TBI, or following a whiplash injury. A different treatment approach will be needed if a person’s symptoms are found to result from any cause other than a prolonged recovery from concussion. Differential diagnoses which may be made instead of a diagnosis of PCS include: Major depressive disorder Post traumatic headache. Read more about headaches » Chronic pain syndrome Cervical strain/whiplash associated disorder Generalized anxiety disorder Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Substance abuse or polypharmacy, i.e. symptoms resulting from adverse reactions to or cross reactivity between medications Somatoform disorder,i.e. psychological symptoms that cannot be fully explained by any underlying general medical or neurological condition Factitious disorder, in which a person convinces themselves that they are experiencing their symptoms Primary sleep disorder: e.g. adjustment insomnia, or chronic insomnia On diagnosing PCS, the doctor may provide patient handouts in order to help educate a person about the condition and to provide information about recovery and the various treatment options available.\n\nDue to the fact that there are no diagnostic tests to help doctors establish a diagnosis of PCS, a doctor may draw on the guidelines suggested by the ICD-10, The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Regulated Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The ICD-10 arranges the symptoms of PCS into the following six categories: 13 Headache, dizziness, malaise, fatigue, noise intolerance (phonophobia) Irritability, depression, anxiety, emotional lability, i.e.rapid shifts between emotions and/or a lack of ability to control emotions and/or expressing emotions differently from normal Subjective concentration, memory or intellectual difficulties, without neurophysiological evidence of marked impairment Insomnia Reduced alcohol tolerance Preoccupation with the above symptoms and/or fear of brain damage with hypochondriacal concern (irrational fear of brain damage) and/or unwillingness to attempt work or social activities as normal, due to the perceived impact of PCS To meet the ICD-10 criteria for diagnosis with PCS, a person must have symptoms which fall into at least three of the above categories. Good to know: The relevance of these guidelines is debated among doctors, and some doctors will diagnose PCS without drawing on the ICD-10 criteria. This is, in part, because they also stipulate that a person must have sustained the primary injury a maximum of four weeks before the diagnosis is made. Cases of PCS may last weeks, months or years, and it is not uncommon for a person to visit their doctor over four weeks after the primary injury took place. Many doctors therefore find a person’s history of traumatic brain injury and their symptoms, if appropriate, sufficient to make a diagnosis of PCS. If you think you may be affected by PCS, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time, by downloading the Ada app .",
    "treatment_for_pcs": "Treatment for PCS usually involves a combination of therapies, targeting the specific symptoms that a person experiences. Each individual symptom may require a different targeted treatment approach, although some types of treatment for PCS, for example vestibular rehabilitation therapy, may provide relief from multiple symptoms, including impaired balance, dizziness, vertigo and vision problems. Due to the fact that the symptoms of PCS vary between people, possible combinations of therapies and medications that may be recommended for treating PCS vary greatly between people, too. Doctors will help devise a care plan that targets all of a person’s symptoms. The simple reassurance physicians can provide can be very helpful in the immediate time period following a TBI, as, in most cases, symptoms improve within three months. Doctors will provide education on PCS and on symptoms that a person might expect or experience following their head injury. This education has two important effects: The severity and duration of PCS symptoms may be lessened. Research suggests that people who are well-informed about the condition recover from it more quickly than people without a solid understanding of what to expect. The inherent anxiety associated with experiencing PCS can be reduced, if the affected person and their family, friends and coworkers are informed about PCS. Education helps the affected person and their support network to understand that PCS is a recognized medical condition and is a relatively common consequence of sustaining a TBI rather than an unusual problem. Good to know: * All or part of a person’s initial treatment plan for PCS may need to be adjusted, depending on whether the treatment(s) that are initially recommended prove effective. Periodic follow-up sessions will be scheduled while a person is undergoing treatment for PCS in order to monitor a person’s recovery acutely and make adjustments to their treatment plan as needed. Treatments for PCS may include:\n\nVision therapy, or vision rehabilitation therapy, has been found to be very effective at treating the vision problems associated with PCS. This treatment will usually be supervised by a doctor specializing in problems related to the eyes, an optometrist, or a behavioural optometrist, who focuses on the intersection between vision problems and behaviour. For example, a behavioural optometrist can help a person with PCS overcome difficulties in concentrating that stem from vision problems and that interfere with their ability to perform everyday activities such as reading. For more information, see the question, What does vision therapy (VT) for PCS involve?, in the FAQs.\n\nVestibular rehabilitation therapy can help a person overcome temporary or permanent changes to the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which controls sensory information about balance, motion and spatial orientation. This type of therapy consists of specialized exercises, which can help treat impaired balance, dizziness, vertigo and some vision problems in those affected by PCS. Good to know: It may not be possible to restore the previous function of the vestibular apparatus. VRT therefore focuses primarily on helping a person develop ways of using their other senses, in order to overcome the difficulties posed by vestibular damage. The process of developing these new techniques is called compensation. 14 (For more information, see the FAQs .)\n\nTreatment for headaches depends on the type of headaches experienced. Tricyclic antidepressants are often prescribed. These can also work to lessen depressive symptoms. For severe headaches, medications used to treat migraine headaches, such as triptan medications, may be recommended. Read more about migraine headaches » Reducing the use of painkillers/analgesics may be helpful for some people in treating headaches. Headaches in PCS are often caused by the overuse of painkillers. Where this is the case, cutting down on or discontinuing the use of the analgesic that is causing the headaches, can be sufficient to allow PCS-related headaches to improve. Lifestyle adaptations such as establishing regular meal times and rest times, and practising relaxation techniques, such as breathing exercises can help to reduce the number and severity of headache attacks. Low-intensity exercise, such as walking, gentle cycling on an exercise (stationary) bicycle or swimming may be helpful. However, all forms of exercise undertaken during recovery from PCS should be discussed in full with a doctor to ensure they pose no risk of prolonging PCS.\n\nPsychotherapy may be recommended to address emotional and behavioural changes associated with PCS, such as irritability and apathy, as well as to treat psychological problems such as anxiety and depression that may accompany or arise from, PCS. The psychotherapeutic technique most commonly employed in the treatment of PCS is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a type of talking therapy led by a cognitive behavioural therapist. CBT aims to provide a person with new techniques for processing their thoughts, which can help alter their emotional responses and behaviour. 15 Mindfulness-based CBT therapy may be recommended to treat anxiety and depression. CBT can also be helpful in addressing other symptoms of PCS; it is often recommended to help a person overcome tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and difficulty sleeping.\n\nAlso known as cognitive remediation, cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) is a combination of techniques that, together, can be used to improve behavioural, emotional and cognitive symptoms of PCS, including improving a person’s attention, memory and cognitive processing speed, as well s recovering lost functions. Certain treatments used in CRT may be the same or similar to those used in vision therapy (VT) and vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) , if a person’s symptoms include problems with hand-eye coordination and balance, or vision problems. (For more information, see the FAQs .)\n\nAlso known as EEG biofeedback and neurotherapy, neurofeedback is a relatively new treatment for cognitive impairment in PCS. Using a special headset linked to a screen, a person performs activities designed to strengthen or develop particular neural connections. This allows them to regain cognitive abilities lost due to their concussion. 16 As they do the tasks, the person can see on the screen which regions of their brain are struggling. Their activity plan is adapted to target and treat problem areas. 17 The length of a course of neurotherapy will depend on a person’s specific symptoms.\n\nWhen PCS is diagnosed, the doctor will ask about the affected person’s sleeping experiences, to screen for sleep disturbances. They will ask about: Difficulties falling or staying asleep, i.e. short-term or chronic insomnia (persists beyond two months) Unusual events during sleep, such as nightmares or unusual bodily functions such as gasping or choking. This may, but will not necessarily, indicate that the person is affected by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) . Daytime tiredness, which can, but will not necessarily, indicate that the person is affected by circadian rhythm sleep wake disorder (CRSWD) If a person is affected by difficulties relating to sleep, the appropriate treatment plan will depend on the particular nature of their problem(s). A focussed sleep assessment will be conducted, in which the doctor will ask many questions to establish the exact circumstances surrounding a person’s sleep routine, the effects of their sleep-related problems on their quality of life and will ascertain if a person is affected by any comorbid conditions, such as headaches or tinnitus (ringing in the ears), which may interrelate with their sleep problems, and may need additional treatment. People undergoing treatment for sleep-related problems are recommended to keep a sleep diary, recording their sleep and wake times and any problems encountered during sleep, as well as any tiredness experienced during the day. This will help to demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment, which can be adjusted as needed. Treatment for sleep disturbances may involve: Practicing good sleep hygiene. Avoid stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine in the hours before bed, create a calm and relaxed sleeping space with a cool temperature and minimal light and noise, make efforts to go to bed and get up at the same time each day. Managing exposure to stimuli. Remove electronic devices from the bedroom, avoid looking at computers, television screens and smartphones before going to sleep, engage in relaxing activities in the evening; rather than ones which may be very stimulating, or intellectually or emotionally charged. Medications. Non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs may be prescribed to promote sleepiness at night time, for a course of between two weeks and one month. Antihistamines, antipsychotics and melatonin receptor agonists are not usually recommended to treat short-term insomnia. Good to know: Activities which require full alertness, such as driving, should be avoided the day after taking non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic medications. This is because the number of hours that they take to wear off varies between people.\n\nPCS can significantly impact upon a person’s quality of life, their ability to do day-to-day activities as normal and their work and personal relationships. This is due to the range of cognitive, behavioural and emotional difficulties that it presents. Stress, overuse of certain parts of the brain and physical activities which risk further impact to the head are all considered to aggravate the risk of persistent PCS and slow down a person’s recovery. There are some steps that a person can make in order to create the best conditions for their treatment to be effective. These include: Seeking help from a medical professional to educate friends and family about PCS and what to expect. This will help to minimise the affected person’s feelings of stress in situations where their cognitive, behavioural and/or emotional changes are evident. Informing school teachers or colleagues following a diagnosis of PCS; certain activities such as looking at computer screens for long periods are not recommended or may be challenging, especially during the early stages of recovery. Lifestyle adaptations, such as working from home or taking some time off, may be necessary. Lifestyle adaptations that may be recommended during recovery from PCS include: Giving the damaged parts of the brain a chance to heal and rest, by avoiding looking at smartphones and/or screens for long periods of time Avoiding situations which foreground cognitive difficulties, such as driving and grocery shopping, until treatment such as vestibular rehabilitation therapy has been effective Practicing mindfulness-based meditation, as an adjunct to CBT therapy in order to overcome the psychological symptoms of PCS Practicing low-intensity exercise such as yoga, rather than high-intensity sports and contact sports, which are not recommended whilst in recovery from PCS. Gentle exercise promotes feelings of calm and relaxation, and may help improve problems with balance and coordination.",
    "prevention": "Most people who are affected by a concussion ‒ those who do not go on to develop post-concussion syndrome ‒ feel themselves to be fully recovered after around two weeks. However, to prevent PCS, a person may be advised by their doctor to continue refraining from certain activities  for a longer period of time, such as high-intensity or contact sports, and activities which are compromised by their PCS symptoms. The purpose of this is to promote the full healing of any internal bruising and bleeding related to the causal injury. Diagnosing and treating the possible symptoms of PCS as early as possible can prevent PCS from developing and/or lessen its extent. For this reason, it is always recommended to seek medical attention after two weeks, if any symptoms of concussion remain present.",
    "post_concussion_syndrome_faqs": "What are the signs of PCS in children? A: When toddlers and older children develop PCS from a concussion, the possible symptoms that they may experience are broadly the same as adults may experience. These persist for, or develop after, more than two weeks following the primary injury. Children, especially toddlers, may lack the language to communicate how they are feeling. Therefore, it is especially important that they are closely monitored for symptoms of PCS during the two-week period after the initial injury and beyond. Common post-concussive symptoms in children include nausea and sleeping more than usual. These should get better in the initial two-week period following their head injury when post-concussion syndrome is not present. In spotting PCS, it can be particularly helpful to look out for the child encountering problems completing activities as normal at school : these may be signs of cognitive impairment related to PCS. In children younger than 6 or 7, signs such as difficulty remembering words and lack of concentration may not be a cause for concern or indicate PCS. In older children, where these abilities will be more developed, beginning to experience such problems may indicate PCS, and a medical opinion should be sought. 18 Read more about signs of concussion in children » Immediate medical attention should be sought in all cases where a toddler or child has sustained a head injury, followed by regular medical check-ups to monitor for the development of PCS. Q: What factors make it more likely that children will develop PCS? A: Research indicates that children are at increased risk of developing PCS following an MTBI if: 19 They experience loss of consciousness immediately after the primary injury The primary injury resulted from a motor-vehicle accident The brain imaging scan taken immediately following the primary injury reveals abnormalities Hospitalization is required to supervise their initial rest and recovery following the primary injury Q: What are the signs of PCS in babies? A: Signs of concussion in babies may include: A bump or bruise to the head Changed sleeping habits; sleeping more or less can both be indicators of concussion Crying when the head is moved Vomiting Changes in mood, especially increased irritability Difficulty feeding In all cases where a baby has sustained an injury to the head, immediate medical attention should be sought. The baby should be monitored closely after the injury, and their symptoms should get better within two weeks of the primary injury, where PCS is not present. In babies, PCS may be indicated by the loss of newly-learned skills, such as babbling, sitting up or pointing. A baby may also cry more than normal or become a pickier eater. Usually, these symptoms resolve of their own accord within weeks or months; lost skills will return, and a baby will not be affected by any ongoing problems. 18 Good to know: After a baby has been affected by an MTBI, there should be no changes to the shape of the head, other than the possibility of slight swelling related to bruising, at the site of the injury. If the baby’s head appears to stop growing in the days or weeks following the injury or there is any bulging of the anterior fontanelle (the soft spot on top of the baby’s head), this may indicate a more serious type of injury and a medical opinion should be sought. 20 Q: Is an affected person usually entitled to workers’ compensation, following a diagnosis of PCS? A: A person who has sustained a concussion and is experiencing long-lasting post concussive symptoms may be entitled to workers’ compensation, particularly if the primary injury was work-related. However, due to the fact that many of the symptoms of PCS are self-reported rather than demonstrable in diagnostic tests, it is not uncommon for people affected by the condition to encounter difficulties in gaining adequate compensation and support from their workplace, especially if the primary injury occurred elsewhere. Many people seek legal advice in order to ensure the best possible outcome when negotiating the terms of their recovery period from PCS with their workplace. Q: When can I resume playing sports after a diagnosis of PCS? A: A graded exercise assessment will be taken periodically in order to monitor a person’s recovery from PCS; this will feature activities designed to reveal the impact of a person’s symptoms on their ability to complete various movements and tasks. People who are considered to have made a full recovery by the medical professionals involved in treating their condition can be granted permission to return to play. 21 However, in cases where symptoms of PCS have been severe, a person may be discouraged from returning to playing contact sports, particularly of the type that caused the initial concussion. This is because the risk of developing PCS following a sports-related head injury is heightened in people who have already been concussed and/or been affected by PCS. Good to know: Return-to-play permissions cannot legally be granted without a person completing a graded exercise assessment and/or other tests to establish the extent of their recovery. It is considered gross negligence to grant someone permission to return to play after PCS on the sole basis of their self-reported loss of symptoms. 22 Q: What is the Post-concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS)? A: Although there are no standard diagnostic tests for PCS, the Post-concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) may sometimes be used. This is a self-assessment questionnaire, which requires the affected person to give their symptoms a numerical rating, resulting in a total score. The PCSS questionnaire is usually filled out several times in the two-week period following a person’s primary injury, often with the objective of determining when they will be ready to return to playing sports. While its results can provide useful information about a person’s perception of their persisting or diminishing symptoms, its medical validity as a diagnostic test for PCS is contested. This is because the information it provides is subjective, revealing only the viewpoint of the affected person and no new neurological or physiological information. 23 Q: What does vision therapy (VT) for PCS involve? A: Although the term exercise is usually associated with strengthening muscles, the aim of vision therapy exercises is different: the purpose of VT activities is to help a person develop new neural connections, in order to overcome the vision problems associated with PCS. Common vision problems associated with PCS which can be treated with vision therapy include: Convergence insufficiency : difficulty focussing at close range, with a tendency to exophoria, i.e. the visual axes of the eyes diverge away from one another, rather than working together Accommodative insufficiency : difficulty focussing or sustaining focus at close range Saccadic dysfunction : difficulty shifting the eyes from one point to another A visual rehabilitation programme will then be devised, often consisting of sessions with the optometrist, combined with regular practice of certain vision exercises at home. 24 Due to the great variability between recovery times from PCS, one person may need a longer treatment programme of vision therapy than another. On average, a complete course of treatment includes 15 sessions. 25 Q: What does vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) for PCS involve? A: When a person undergoes VRT, an exercise routine will be devised by a doctor specializing in vestibular disorders, which a person can practice daily at home. This will primarily consist of exercises including: Habituation. Movement exercises, often focussed on transitioning between sitting, standing and lying down. These exercises are designed to treat symptoms of dizziness that occur due to motion and/or visual stimuli. Gaze stabilization. There are two possible aims of gaze stabilization exercises. They can be used to reduce vision problems related to head movement, such as the view appearing to bounce around when a person turns, sits or stands. Gaze exercises can also be used to help a person develop visual capabilities, as compensation for damage to the vestibular system. Balance training. These exercises help a person regain their steadiness and/or overcome dizziness and vertigo associated with PCS. They may involve performing tasks while balancing, practicing movement routines and/or moving in response to visual or sound cues. Many people affected by vestibular symptoms of PCS recover within a few months of undergoing VRT, with daily practice. Due to the variable nature of PCS, the length and intensity of a person’s treatment programme will depend on their specific symptoms. Q: What does cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) for PCS involve? A: CRT aims to create new neural pathways and connections which can help a person overcome the difficulties posed by their symptoms of PCS. 26 A team of healthcare professionals with different neurological and psychological specialisms will usually be involved in delivering CRT, as this treatment is based on acknowledging the overlap between the cognitive, psychological and physical factors that contribute to PCS symptoms. 27 For example, the emotional distress that may be experienced as a result of failing to carry out an everyday task as normal, such as reading a map or book, can further impact upon their ability to do so by raising the level of activity in the brain. To discern the correct CRT treatment approach for a person, diagnostic tests such as a neurological exam and neuropsychological exam will be carried out, in some cases accompanied by imaging tests such as a CT scan of the head. A programme will then be devised which aims to build a person’s visual and auditory skills through exercises completed in CRT sessions, with a focus on restoring a person’s abilities to complete day-to-day tasks as normal. A CRT treatment plan may require certain lifestyle adaptations, including avoiding certain activities such as looking at computer screens or smartphones. These will be strategically reintroduced as a person responds to their CRT treatment."

    "what_is_post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is a disease of the kidneys which occurs after infection with certain strains of a bacterium called group A streptococcus (GAS). 1 Streptococcal bacteria can cause a number of different conditions. Symptoms of these conditions often affect the skin and throat, such as in scarlet fever and tonsillitis. 2 The most common symptom of PSGN is swelling around the eyes . 3 This swelling can also affect other parts of the body , such as the hands and feet. Dark or rusty colored urine is a possible early sign of the condition. 4 However, approximately half of people affected by PSGN will display no symptoms. PSGN is a knock-on effect of the infection in the kidneys. As a response to the infection, blood vessels in the kidneys become inflamed. This makes it harder for the kidneys to filter urine. 5\n\nThe disease is now very rare in high-income countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. Children are the age group most affected by the condition worldwide, but when it does occur in high-income countries such as the U.S., it is usually the elderly that are most affected. 6 PSGN usually resolves itself after a few weeks or months. Treatment is directed at controlling symptoms through medication and removing any infection left in the body with antibiotics such as penicillin. 5 A low-salt diet may be recommended to control swelling. The vast majority of people affected by PSGN will recover with no complications. However, in rare cases the condition can lead to long-term kidney damage, such as kidney failure. This is far more common in adults than in children. 1 4",
    "post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis_symptoms": "The severity of symptoms varies from person to person . Approximately half of people affected by PSGN display no signs of the illness . 3 When symptoms do occur, it is usually between seven and 21 days after the group A streptococcal infection begins. The most common effect of the condition is swelling that begins around the eyes. 3 The swelling can sometimes affect other parts of the body, notably the hands and feet. 5 Another symptom of the condition is dark-colored urine, sometimes described as rust-colored or cola-colored. This dark coloration is due to blood being present in the urine. 3 High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common effect of PSGN. However, this can often cause no observable symptoms. Other potential symptoms include: 1 4 3 Less need to urinate than usual Protein in the urine. This may not be visible, but when it is, the urine has a frothy appearance Increased tiredness due to anemia Abdominal pain A loss of appetite Fever Headache",
    "what_causes_post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "The kidneys are two organs that sit underneath the ribs in the back of the abdomen and that are responsible for filtering toxins from the blood. If the small filtration units of the kidney, known as the glomeruli, become inflamed and swollen, this is called glomerulonephritis. There are several other possible causes for this besides infection with GAS bacteria . These include autoimmune disorders - when the immune system mistakenly begins to attack the healthy body tissues - and various other medical conditions, including diabetes and some cancers. PSGN is not an infection and is thought to be the immune system’s reaction to the GAS infection. In other words, PSGN itself cannot be caught from other people. 4 Most group A streptococcal infections that lead to PSGN primarily affect the skin or the throat. These include: 2 Cobblestone throat (pharyngitis) Tonsillitis Scarlet fever Impetigo Erysipelas Cellulitis Pneumonia Children between two and 12 are the age group most at risk of developing PSGN. Six or seven years old is the age when the infection is most likely. Males are more likely to be affected than females, and the condition often occurs after a large outbreak of an infection, otherwise known as an epidemic. 6 PSGN is most common in tropical countries where skin infections are a regular occurrence. PSGN is now very rare in high-income countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. In these countries, it primarily affects those over 50, particularly men. The following are risk factors for developing the condition later in life: 1 6 Diabetes mellitus High consumption of alcohol HIV infection Tumors and cancers",
    "how_to_diagnose_post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms affecting a person who has recently been unwell with a bacterial infection . Several tests may be carried out to help with the diagnosis, including blood tests and urine tests for the following purposes: 5 7 To help confirm the diagnosis of PSGN To check on how well the kidney is functioning To find out if the group A streptococcal infection is still present An ultrasound , which is when sound waves are used to create an image inside of the body, may be carried out on the kidney. The organ is often visible in an ultrasound as slightly enlarged in people affected by PSGN. 7 In rare cases - usually where a person is not showing the typical signs of PSGN, or if serious complications are suspected - a kidney biopsy may be recommended. This is when a special needle is used to remove a few very small pieces of the kidney so that they can be laboratory tested. 7",
    "how_to_treat_post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "PSGN usually resolves itself in a few weeks or months. 5 By the time post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is diagnosed in most children, the body has already begun to recover from the inflammation. 8 . Medication and lifestyle changes can give some relief from the symptoms and address any complications that the condition may cause.\n\nOne of the first recommendations a doctor may give will usually be to restrict salt in the diet and to drink less water. 1 Temporarily eating less protein, i.e. cutting out meat and plant-based protein products, may be recommended. 8\n\nPenicillin may be recommended if there is any remaining evidence of group A streptococcal infection. Erythromycin may be given instead if the person affected is allergic to penicillin. 8 Loop diuretics, which increase urine production, may be recommended to reduce swelling and control blood pressure. 5 Other blood pressure medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers, may also be used as part of treatment for PSGN. 8",
    "prevention": "The best means of preventing PSGN is to prevent the spread of group A streptococcal infection. At present, there is no vaccine available to prevent group A streptococcal infection . 9 As a result, practicing good hygiene and ensuring that anybody affected by GAS or PSGN is treated are the best ways to prevent the condition. This includes: 10 Washing the hands thoroughly before eating or preparing food Covering the mouth or nose before coughing or sneezing Staying at home until after being treated with antibiotics for GAS infection or until after fever stops completely",
    "complications": "Most people affected by PSGN recover in a few weeks. However, there are several possible complications that may occur because of the condition. These complications are generally more common in adults than in children. They include: 5 6 High blood pressure, also known as hypertension Renal failure Anemia Pulmonary edema, a buildup of fluid in the lungs Hyperkalemia, an abnormally high level of potassium in the blood Heart failure is a rare but possible complication of PSGN.",
    "other_names_for_post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis Postinfectious glomerulonephritis",
    "post_streptococcal_glomerulonephritis": "Q: Is post streptococcal glomerulonephritis contagious? A: PSGN itself is not contagious. However, it develops in some people as a response to being infected with a bacterium called group A streptococcus, which can be caught from others. Practicing good hygiene and encouraging those around you to practice it, too, is currently the best way to avoid being affected by PSGN. Q: Do antibiotics stop post streptococcal glomerulonephritis? A: Antibiotics cannot be used to treat PSGN itself, but penicillin may be prescribed to treat any underlying group A streptococcal infection that remains in the affected person’s body at the time of diagnosis (see causes for more information). Treatment with antibiotics significantly reduces the risk of passing a group A streptococcal infection onto others. Q: How long does post streptococcal glomerulonephritis last? A: Most people recover from the symptoms of PSGN after a few weeks."

    "what_is_post_traumatic_stress_disorder_ptsd": "Post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD and sometimes written as post traumatic stress disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder, is a condition that sometimes develops after a person experiences or witnesses a life-threatening, terrifying or otherwise deeply traumatic event. 1 Examples include: 2 3 4 Combat Natural disasters like floods, fires or earthquakes Terrorist attacks Car accidents Physical or sexual assault Experiencing a heart attack 5 or the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one can also lead to PTSD in susceptible people. 1 After a trauma, it is normal to experience flashbacks, nightmares or intrusive memories. Many people may feel tense, scared or helpless, have difficulty sleeping and struggle to go about their daily activities. Within a few weeks, however, most people will start to feel better. If symptoms of a stress reaction persist, a person may be diagnosed with PTSD. 2 3 4 1 While post-traumatic stress disorder can affect people of any age and gender, it seems to be more prevalent among some groups. These include female victims of rape, refugees, firefighters, and teenagers who have experienced car accidents. 6 7 Generally, the outlook for PTSD is good, and most people will get better even without treatment. However, recovery without treatment may take months or even years. Treatment, which typically involves psychotherapy, sometimes with medication, may help to alleviate the symptoms and shorten the duration of PTSD. In a minority of people, PTSD may become a chronic condition. 2 1 6 7 8\n\nMost people will experience some of the symptoms present in PTSD soon, days or weeks after a traumatic event. If the symptoms dissipate within a month, the condition is called acute stress disorder (ASD) or acute stress reaction. 1 Treatment, if deemed necessary, may include psychotherapy and a short-term course of beta-blockers, to alleviate some of the physical symptoms, or other appropriate anti-anxiety medication. 9 Good to know: If symptoms persist for more than 30 days, a diagnosis of PTSD may be considered. 5 Read more about Acute Stress Disorder »",
    "ptsd_symptoms": "Symptoms of PTSD typically present soon after a traumatic event. Sometimes, however, a number of months may pass before symptoms appear. 2 1 Rarely, symptoms of PTSD may first be experienced more than a year after the event. 7 PTSD symptoms can be divided into four categories. Most people with PTSD will experience symptoms from each of the following categories for longer than one month: 2 1 6 7 Re-experiencing (reliving) symptoms. Recurring thoughts, bad memories, nightmares or flashbacks of the trauma. These are distressing. Avoidance symptoms. Avoiding situations or people that serve as reminders of the trauma or avoiding talking or thinking about it. Some people may spend unusual amounts of time on hobbies or work. 10 Conversely, others may ruminate excessively on the trauma. 7 Arousal symptoms. Feeling anxious or hyper alert, difficulty concentrating or sleeping, irritability and outbursts of anger, startling easily. Mood and cognition symptoms. Guilt, shame, negative thoughts, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, feeling that the world is dangerous, feeling numb or detached, difficulty remembering the trauma, derealization (feeling like one’s perceptions are not real), 11 an inability to feel optimistic, happy or loving. Physical symptoms of PTSD may also be present. These can include: Muscle pain Diarrhea An irregular heartbeat Headaches Some people experiencing PTSD may also act recklessly or impulsively 12 or abuse alcohol or drugs. 10 Good to know: If any symptoms have been present for longer than four weeks, are causing serious distress or are interfering with daily life, it is advisable to see a healthcare practitioner without delay. 2 If you think that you might have signs of PTSD, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "ptsd_causes": "Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop after a person of any age experiences or witnesses a deeply traumatic event – often one that is life-threatening or perceived as life-threatening. Examples include: 6 7 11 Natural disasters Serious accidents Sexual assault and other severe types of assault Combat Mass conflict Torture Terrorist attacks Seeing someone being killed Domestic violence, heart attacks, strokes, severe injury, sudden severe illness, hospitalization in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one may also lead to PTSD. 1 7 5 Less severe, but still serious traumatic events may also cause PTSD-like symptoms in certain people. 6 Good to know: Seeing a traumatic event on television or in other media is not typically considered a trigger for PTSD. 5 12",
    "ptsd_risk_factors": "Not everyone who experiences trauma will go on to experience PTSD. A number of factors may increase the risk of a person developing the condition. These include: 6 5 11 Being female Being in a racial or ethnic minority 6 13 Low levels of education Low socioeconomic status Being separated, divorced or widowed Childhood abuse or adversity Previous exposure to trauma Personal or family history of mental health conditions Severe additional stress after the trauma 1 Lack of social support Severity of initial reaction to the trauma In addition, certain types of trauma are thought to be more likely to lead to PTSD than others. These include traumatic events that are: 10 Sudden and unexpected Continue for a long time Allow no means of escape Are man-made Cause mutilation or multiple deaths Involve children Certain people are considered to be at higher risk than the general population of developing PTSD. These include: 6 7 Female victims of rape Refugees Asylum seekers Emergency response workers such as the police, firefighters and paramedics\n\nSoldiers and other members of the military may also have an increased risk of PTSD. The following factors are thought to contribute to the development of PTSD in military personnel: 7 5 Having a combat role in war Severe injury during combat, especially traumatic brain injury Serious accidents Low rank Low morale Low education Leaving the service Lack of social support Being unmarried Childhood adversity",
    "diagnosis": "After taking a person’s history and performing a physical examination, a healthcare practitioner will typically diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder using the following criteria: 1 5 12 Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence. This may involve direct experience of a traumatic event, witnessing an event, a close relative or friend directly experiencing an event, or exposure to traumatic events as part of one’s job. One or more intrusive, re-experiencing symptoms. This may involve recurrent distressing memories, nightmares, flashbacks or distress, when reminded of the trauma. One or more avoidance symptoms. This may involve avoiding people, places and other external triggers that may remind one of the trauma or trying to avoid thinking about it. Two or more arousal symptoms. These may include irritability and angry outbursts, reckless behavior, feeling hyper alert, startling easily, difficulty concentrating or sleep disturbances. Two or more mood and cognition symptoms. These may include inability to remember the trauma or aspects thereof, negative thoughts about oneself or the world, guilt, shame or other negative emotions, loss of interest in enjoyable activities, detachment or an inability to feel positive emotions like happiness or love. For a diagnosis of PTSD to be made, the symptoms should first appear after a traumatic event, persist for longer than a month, cause significant distress or marked difficulty in social and job situations and not be caused by substance abuse or another health condition. 5 The above criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD apply to anyone older than six. Diagnosis of PTSD in children younger than six may be based on different criteria (see the section titled PTSD in children below).",
    "ptsd_treatment": "A number of effective treatments are available for post-traumatic stress disorder. The primary treatment is psychotherapy, which is sometimes combined with medication. 3 If symptoms of PTSD are mild and less than a month has passed since the traumatic event, a diagnosis of ASD may be made and the condition managed accordingly. However, where symptoms are moderate or severe and persist, one or more of the types of treatment below will typically be recommended. 6 7\n\nWhile various types of psychotherapy exist, the following are considered to be most effective and are often recommended for the treatment of PTSD: Exposure therapy. This type of therapy allows people to confront their trauma in a safe, guided manner so that it can be processed emotionally, thereby lessening distress. 14 Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT). This type of therapy helps people to identify and change unhelpful thought patterns and behaviors related to the trauma, thereby aiding recovery. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a type of TFCBT that is widely used in the treatment of PTSD. 6 7 14 Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). A form of CBT that uses specific eye movements to help ease distress from trauma. 6 7 14 Depending on the individual, group therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction and other types of therapeutic intervention may also be considered. 6 10 14\n\nIf psychotherapy alone does not seem to be adequate for a person affected by PTSD, medication may be prescribed. PTSD medication may include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of PTSD by acting on chemicals in the brain. SSRIs typically require 2-4 weeks to start working and are taken for a number of months. Examples of SSRIs prescribed for PTSD include fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. 6 7 10 15 Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Similar to SSRIs, these antidepressants may reduce the symptoms of PTSD by altering chemicals in the brain. Venlafaxine is the SNRI typically prescribed for PTSD. 6 7 15 Other antidepressants. There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and other types of antidepressants in the treatment of PTSD. 15 However, these may be prescribed at the discretion of a doctor in certain situations. Anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepines like diazepam are sometimes prescribed to reduce the symptoms of anxiety, over-alertness and sleep disturbances in PTSD. However, because they are highly addictive, they should not be used for longer than a week or two. 6 10 15 Where treatment with an SSRI or SNRI is not effective or sufficient, other medications may occasionally be recommended. These include antipsychotics like quetiapine and risperidone, as well as other medications like clonidine and prazosin, which are sometimes used in the management of anxiety , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and PTSD (though their efficacy in the treatment of PTSD require more research). 7 15\n\nThough evidence of effectiveness is lacking, some people may find the following to be helpful as part of their treatment of PTSD: 10 11 16 Mindfulness and meditation practices Yoga Acupuncture Massage Service animals such as dogs Support groups 6",
    "prevention": "While it may not be possible to prevent the development of PTSD, the following interventions may be helpful: Support from family and friends. This may help a person to recover after a traumatic event. 3 Minimizing stress. Trying to avoid other sources of stress as much as possible may also aid recovery after a traumatic event. 3 Psychotherapy. Multiple (4-12) sessions of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) or certain other types of therapy may help people affected by PTSD to manage the condition. Single counseling sessions may do more harm than good. 13 Medication. Early studies suggest that prompt treatment with hydrocortisone after exposure to a traumatic event may reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. However, more research is needed. 13 Clonidine is another possible medication with this effect that requires more research. 6 In addition, post-deployment support may be useful for members of the military who have been involved in combat situations. Screening may be helpful for people who have experienced natural disasters, as well as for asylum seekers and refugees, as they are considered to have a relatively high risk of developing PTSD. Treatment can then be recommended where necessary. 6 7",
    "related_health_complications": "PTSD is associated with a number of possible physical and mental health complications.\n\nPeople with post-traumatic stress disorder seem to have a higher risk of developing a range of physical health conditions. These include muscle, joint and nerve pain; stomach and intestinal issues and problems with the heart and lungs. 7\n\nPTSD often seems to occur with other mental health conditions like depression or anxiety . There also appears to be a high rate of substance abuse among people with PTSD. 1 6 7 12 People affected by PTSD may have an increased risk of suicide. 17 If someone shows signs of crisis, it is essential to contact a suicide prevention lifeline or emergency services without delay.\n\nPTSD may also cause difficulties in relationships with partners, friends and family. A person with PTSD may experience challenges with trust, intimacy, communication and problem-solving. 4 Therapy may be recommended to help with this. In some cases, PTSD may become a chronic condition that lasts years. However, research suggests that Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) may be effective in treating even complicated cases of long duration. 7 12\n\nComplex PTSD has been proposed as a separate diagnosis for the symptoms that result from long-term, chronic, trauma such as ongoing domestic abuse. People who have been exposed to trauma of an extended duration may experience additional symptoms to those commonly reported in PTSD – one example being changes in identity. 12 18 While complex PTSD is not medically accepted as a separate diagnosis to PTSD, there seems to be an understanding that cases of prolonged trauma may require specialized treatment approaches. 12 18",
    "ptsd_in_children": "While people of any age can develop PTSD after a traumatic event, the symptoms may be different in children – particularly those who are very young. 19\n\nPTSD symptoms vary from child to child. While some of the symptoms may be the same as those experienced by adults, in children the following may also be present: 19 20 Repeated re-enactment of the traumatic event while playing Mixing up the order of the traumatic event False identification of signs predicting the trauma and belief that future trauma can be prevented by monitoring for similar signs Nightmares that are not obviously about the trauma Fear of sleeping alone Blaming of self or those close to them Tantrums and aggression towards others Separation anxiety Difficulties at school Good to know: In teenagers, symptoms of PTSD are usually similar to those of adults. However, they are more likely to act aggressively or recklessly as part of the condition. 20 If you think that you or a loved one might have signs of PTSD, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.\n\nThe causes of PTSD in children are largely the same as those in adults. Experiencing trauma in the form of animal bites, major surgery, emotional abuse, bullying and neglect may also be considered as potential causes of PTSD in young children. 21\n\nFactors that are thought to affect a child’s risk of developing PTSD include: 21 The severity of the trauma The child’s proximity and relationship to the trauma Being female 20 The duration of the trauma Recurrence of trauma Available support from caregivers\n\nThe criteria outlined above are used to diagnose PTSD in anyone over the age of six. In younger children, the following criteria are typically used: 19 Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual violence. This may involve direct experience of a traumatic event, witnessing an event or a caregiver directly experiencing an event. One or more intrusive (re-experiencing) symptom. This may involve recurrent, distressing memories of the event, these may be expressed as repeated re-enactment of the trauma through play, or sometimes drawing, which does not always seem upsetting to the child, 22 nightmares not necessarily specific to the trauma, flashbacks or visible distress when reminded of the trauma. One or more avoidance or mood and cognition symptom. This may involve attempting to avoid people, places and other external triggers that may remind the child of the trauma, more frequent negative moods, e.g. noticeable guilt, shame, sadness or similar emotions, loss of interest in enjoyable activities such as playing, being withdrawn or reduced expression of positive emotions like happiness or love. Two or more arousal symptoms. These may include irritability and angry outbursts (including tantrums), being hypervigilant, startling easily or being difficult to calm, 23 difficulty concentrating or sleep disturbances. Additional indications of PTSD in young children may include a sudden regression in developmental skills, e.g. bedwetting, thumb-sucking, making baby-talk, 24 25 the appearance of new or old fears, unexplained accidents, behaving recklessly, separation anxiety, e.g. clinging to a caregiver, and the reporting of physical ailments like stomachaches and headaches. Children may also become hyperactive and seem easily distracted. 26 For a diagnosis of PTSD to be made, the symptoms should first appear after a traumatic event, persist for longer than a month, cause significant distress or marked difficulty at school or in relationships with caregivers, siblings or peers, and not be caused by a substance or another health condition. 19 Caregivers are advised to monitor for significant changes in a child’s behavior, play and sleep patterns and consult with a child healthcare specialist, should anything seem amiss.\n\nChildren and teenagers affected by PTSD are typically treated in the same way as adults. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT), sometimes in combination with medication, may be recommended. 21 20\n\nWhile it may not be possible to prevent PTSD in children, steps can be taken to minimize the risk of them developing the condition. These include: 21 Teaching children to say no to anyone who threatens them or makes them feel uncomfortable. Ensuring that they have access to appropriate support in the event that they experience trauma.",

    "condition": "Preeclampsia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/preeclampsia/",
    "what_is_preeclampsia": "Preeclampsia, also spelled pre-eclampsia and formerly sometimes called toxemia, is a potentially serious condition that affects only pregnant women after the 20th week of pregnancy or shortly after delivery. 1 Its characteristic symptoms are sudden-onset proteinuria (protein in the urine) and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is not yet known for certain what causes preeclampsia, but it may have something to do with abnormalities of the placental blood supply. Preeclampsia may also occur alongside HELLP syndrome, which is very serious and may progress to eclampsia, which is also very serious and may be fatal. Preeclampsia affects only between about two and eight of every 100 pregnant women. 2 Severe preeclampsia affects only about one in every 200 pregnancies. HELLP Syndrome has a similar incidence, but around half of women with severe preeclampsia will develop HELLP Syndrome. Rates of eclampsia are low in most developed countries, with an incidence of around one in every 2000 pregnancies. However, the rate is considerably higher in developing countries. 3",
    "signs_and_symptoms": "Preeclampsia is often diagnosed during a routine visit to the doctor. The early signs of preeclampsia include: 1 4 Hypertension (high blood pressure). A blood pressure of 140 over 90 is considered a sign in women who do not have pre-existing hypertension. Proteinuria (protein in the urine). This is defined as 300mg or more of protein passed in the urine over 24 hours. Foamy urine is a sign of proteinuria. If a pregnant woman finds that her urine is foamy, she should consult a physician as soon as possible. Other symptoms which may appear as the disorder worsens include: 1 2 4 5 6 Headache that cannot be alleviated with painkillers Edema (swelling) of hands, arms, face and/or feet Blurred vision or blind spots Confusion or disorientation Nausea and vomiting Pain in the upper right abdomen, just below the ribs or behind the breastbone A pain feeling like heartburn that cannot be alleviated by antacids Feeling of great unwellness Oliguria (low urine output) of 500ml or less over 24 hours Being unable to feel the baby move as much as previously Shortness of breath, possibly due to pulmonary edema (excess fluid in the lungs) Stroke. This is very rare\n\nIf any of these symptoms appear, the affected person should receive medical help as soon as possible. Without treatment, preeclampsia may become eclampsia, which is very serious and may be in rarer cases even be fatal. This is very rarely the case in developed countries, however, and adequate prenatal care may make it even less likely. 7\n\nMany women have hypertension during pregnancy, without having preeclampsia. Hypertension that results from preeclampsia is normally distinguishable from pre-existing or chronic hypertension by its sudden onset. 4 Hypertension during pregnancy is also believed to be influenced by low magnesium intake, as well as other factors, and low calcium intake leading to low levels of calcium in the body. 8 Diets with a high-calorie intake may also play a role. It is possible for preeclampsia-related hypertension to happen at the same time as chronic hypertension. It may be quite difficult to diagnose preeclampsia in women with chronic hypertension. 6 It may be hard to diagnose preeclampsia-related proteinuria accurately in women with pre-existing proteinuria or renal diseases . One indication that preeclampsia-related proteinuria is present may be a sudden upward spike in the levels of protein being excreted. In all of these cases, if proteinuria is present, preeclampsia is also likely to be present.\n\nThe headache that accompanies preeclampsia is often described as dull and throbbing and has also been described as migraine-like. 9 Importantly, it does not respond to commonly used over-the-counter painkillers. 10\n\nAbout a quarter of women with severe preeclampsia and up to half of all women with eclampsia (see below) report visual problems, especially blurred vision. 11 Preeclampsia can cause eye problems such as: ref13 12 Hypertensive retinopathy , caused by high blood pressure damaging the retina or the eye Exudative retinal detachment, caused by inflammation causing fluid to build up under the retina Cortical blindness, caused by problems with the brain’s occipital cortex, which controls vision Types of visual disturbances caused by preeclampsia include: 11 12 Blurred vision Flashes of light Difficulty focusing or sudden/rapidly-developing inability to focus Blind spots Double vision Loss of vision in one or both eyes\n\nAbdominal pain is a common symptom of preeclampsia. It is classically felt in the upper-right abdomen, below the ribs – roughly where the liver is located, but can often also be felt below the breastbone, a region known as the epigastrium, and may at times also radiate towards the right hand side of the back. 13 There is some evidence that severe upper-right abdominal pain in  pregnant women indicates that the the liver has been affected, 14 which increases the risk of HELLP Syndrome developing. 15 Severe upper-right abdominal pain is an important sign that HELLP Syndrome may be developing.  If a pregnant person develops upper-right abdominal pain, they should contact their physicians as soon as possible.\n\nMost women with preeclampsia will not go on to develop severe preeclampsia if they are promptly treated. Signs and symptoms which can indicate severe preeclampsia include: 4 Worsening physical symptoms, as listed above Renal insufficiency due to kidney damage from high blood pressure Moderate to severe thrombocytopenia,  i.e. low platelet count of 100 000 or lower Twice the normal serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (enzymes found in the liver) In mothers with severe preeclampsia, the unborn baby usually suffers from reduced oxygen and nutrient supply, which can retard fetal growth. Babies can be measured by medical practitioners to determine whether they are small for gestational age.",
    "causes": "The cause of preeclampsia is not yet completely understood by doctors. It appears to involve inflammation of maternal blood vessels, particularly those in the kidneys. This may be due to abnormalities in the way that the placental blood supply develops, which can impact the effectiveness of the attachment of the placenta to the uterine wall. 3 An imperfect attachment may cause inflammatory substances to be released into the mother’s bloodstream. It is not yet known whether preeclampsia is caused by these abnormalities or whether these abnormalities and preeclampsia share a cause. There is some evidence that preeclampsia and heart disease share some risk factors, namely: 16 Endothelial dysfunction (dysfunction of the lining of the blood vessels and lymph glands) Obesity Hypertension Hyperglycemia Insulin resistance Dyslipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood). There also appears to be a genetic component that determines a person’s risk of developing preeclampsia. If a pregnant person’s mother and/or sisters have a history of preeclampsia, their risk of preeclampsia is higher than that of a person without such a family history. Having had a previous pregnancy with preeclampsia also increases risk. 17 In such high-risk pregnancies, there is some evidence that a daily low dose (81mg/day) of aspirin may have a protective effect. While the cause is uncertain, the risk factors for preeclampsia are well-known. Risk of preeclampsia is higher in women who: 1 2 4 Have diabetes (type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes) Are pregnant for the first time Are pregnant for the first time in 10 years Are having a multiple pregnancy of twins, triplets, etc. Have a BMI of 35 or greater, or body weight of 90kg or greater Are older than 40 or younger than 17 years old Have existing high blood pressure Have existing kidney disease Have existing vascular disorders Have existing clotting disorders Have a history of preeclampsia Have a family history of preeclampsia\n\nPreeclampsia is slightly more common among pregnant women from poorer communities, which may suggest that there is a connection between nutrition and preeclampsia. However, this theory has not been properly tested. A related theory is that overnutrition, especially obesity before and during pregnancy, as well as undernutrition, can both cause the risk of preeclampsia to rise. It has been suggested that low-protein diets, low-fat diets and low-energy diets may affect preeclampsia. Again, however, these hypotheses have not been proven. 18 There is some evidence that preeclampsia and atherosclerosis share risk factors, including: 18 Obesity Insulin resistance, a condition associated with type 2 diabetes , where the body does not respond to the hormone insulin, leading to high blood glucose levels Thrombophilia, a condition causing blood clots to form Hyperhomocysteinemia, abnormally high levels of the amino acid homocysteine in the blood African heritage The link appears to be that both conditions increase the number of oxidants in the body. Some studies have therefore suggested that antioxidants such as Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, or a Vitamin E-related compound such as tocopherol may be helpful in reducing the risk of preeclampsia. However, trials to test the efficacy of supplementing the diet of pregnant women with antioxidants like vitamin E and vitamin C to help reduce the risk of preeclampsia have been inconclusive. 19 It is also possible that taking antioxidants as supplements might have a different effect to absorbing antioxidants through food. This theory is yet to be fully proven. 18\n\nThe only things that are proven to have a positive effect on reducing the risk of preeclampsia are calcium supplements and low-dose aspirin. . A diet high in fruit and vegetables is also known to have a beneficial effect on overall health among pregnant women, therefore reducing the risk of conditions that increase the risk of preeclampsia. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and cutting out alcohol can also help. It is important to note that calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia is only effective in women who have low calcium intake in their diets: it does not make a difference if the pregnant person’s diet already had adequate calcium. 18 If a pregnant person is concerned that they may have low calcium, they can ask their doctor to run a test. Omega-3 supplementation may have a protective effect against preeclampsia, but this is not known for sure. It was also formerly thought that sodium (salt) intake should be restricted to prevent preeclampsia, and, while a low-salt diet will reduce the risk of hypertension, it should not be done if it affects adequate intake of protein, calcium and energy. 18\n\nPregnant women should not modify their diets or begin dietary supplementation without consulting their OB-GYN team or primary physician.",
    "complications": "Most cases of preeclampsia are relatively mild and can be treated without much danger to the mother or the unborn baby. However, in some cases the situation can become more severe. HELLP Syndrome and eclampsia are two serious complications of eclampsia.\n\nHELLP syndrome may be considered a very severe form of preeclampsia or a separate but overlapping disorder. The acronym HELLP stands for “hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count”, which refers to the main features of the condition. 2 HELLP tends to have a sudden onset with similar symptoms to preeclampsia. 20\n\nSigns and symptoms that may be immediately apparent include: 2 3 Nausea and vomiting Pain in the upper abdominal (stomach) region Headache Vision problems Bruising easily or purple spots on the skin Tender or swollen liver High blood pressure\n\nSigns that can be determined only by testing include: 2 Proteinuria Hemolysis (disintegrating blood cells) Raised enzyme levels Thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) HELLP Syndrome can occur at any point after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but is most common between 27 and 37 weeks. However, between 15 % to 30 % of cases of HELLP Syndrome occur only after delivery. Long-term complications can include: 3 Retarded fetal growth Placental abruption, i.e., separation of placenta from uterine wall before labor Blood clotting problems Eclampsia, i.e. seizures in pregnant women with high blood pressure Liver failure Placental abruption can reduce the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the unborn baby, increasing the risk of retarded fetal growth. In severe cases, the unborn child may not survive. 21\n\nEclampsia is a very serious complication of pregnancy and must be treated rapidly. 22 Despite advances in medical care, eclampsia is still a leading cause of maternal mortality. 23 Eclampsia is diagnosed when a pregnant person with preeclampsia begins to have seizures. 24 . In most cases, the person with eclampsia will have shown symptoms of severe preeclampsia, but in some cases, no prior symptoms of preeclampsia appear. If eclampsia is not treated rapidly, it can lead to maternal coma, brain damage, and death. 25",
    "treatment_and_care": "Deciding which treatment option for preeclampsia is best involves balancing the severity of the preeclampsia with the risks facing the baby. The only total cure for preeclampsia is to deliver the baby and placenta. If it is safe to do so for both the mother and the baby, the pregnancy will be maintained until the natural end of gestation, around 37 weeks. Only if the life of the mother or the baby is in danger will labor be induced early. However, if the baby is still too young to survive outside the womb, the medical care team will take steps to maintain the pregnancy until it is safe to deliver, if it is safe for the mother to do so. In cases of mild preeclampsia, a short period of initial hospitalization may be followed by home care as an outpatient, often extending until the baby is delivered. Home care includes: 4 Bed rest Regular blood pressure tests Regular fetal nonstress tests (NSTs) to check on the baby’s health Visits to a physician two or three times a week It can also be helpful to increase the amount of protein eaten, minimize salt intake and ensure that enough water is consumed to stay well-hydrated. 26\n\nWhen home care is not advisable due to the severity of the symptoms, women with preeclampsia will usually be hospitalized. The treatment concentrates on managing hypertension and monitoring for complications. Treatment includes: 2 27 6 Medication to lower blood pressure, such as hydralazine, labetalol and nifedipine Blood pressure tests at intervals of four hours, or, in severe cases, every 15 to 30 minutes Urine tests for protein Monitoring of hydration Blood tests to monitor platelet count, clotting factors, and kidney and liver function If preeclampsia occurs in late pregnancy, labor may be induced if the baby or the mother have blood pressure levels that cannot be controlled until the baby comes to full term.  In such cases, the baby may be delivered, vaginally or by cesarean section. In cases where the baby is only a few weeks premature, the risks to the baby’s health are low. However, if the baby is less than 34 weeks along, it is the severity of the mother’s preeclampsia that will determine whether the medical team opts to deliver the baby. 2 Outcomes for the baby may improve if the pregnancy is maintained, but treatment should not be at the expense of maternal wellbeing. In some cases, corticosteroids may be administered to boost the baby’s lung development in order to allow it to be safely delivered earlier. 25 If corticosteroid treatment is undertaken, the baby’s heart rate should be monitored very closely. 28 If they are not thriving in the womb and have a better chance of survival if delivered, labor should be induced. If HELLP syndrome is present, delivery will be induced regardless. 27 In cases of eclampsia, also, delivery should not be postponed unless the mother is in an unstable condition, in which case the mother should be stabilized before delivery is attempted. This should be done regardless of whether or not the baby is distressed. 6 In cases of eclampsia, the mother’s oxygen intake and seizures should be brought under control before delivery. Both baby and mother will need to be in a high-dependency unit for at least 24 hours after birth. 6 Seizures can be prevented with an intravenous dose of magnesium sulfate and may be broken using lorazepam or diazepam. 29 Magnesium sulfate can have serious side effects and should only be administered by a skilled practitioner.\n\nMost instances of preeclampsia happen before the baby is born, and subside soon after delivery. However, in a minority of cases, preeclampsia occurs only after delivery . If this happens, the affected person will be placed in a hospital high-dependency unit and monitored for signs of eclampsia. Once the medical team has established that they are not at risk of eclampsia, they will remain in hospital to be monitored for hypertension and further complications. 2",
    "preeclampsia_faqs": "Q: What are the long-term complications for women who have had preeclampsia? A: There is some evidence that women who had preeclampsia, eclampsia, or HELLP syndrome may be at increased risk of hypertension and heart disease in later life. 6 It may also increase the risk of stroke. Q: Will my preeclampsia have long-term effects on my child once they are born? A: Children born to mothers with preeclampsia may be at increased risk of endocrine and nutritional diseases, which can affect height and weight gain. 30 Q: Does low-dose aspirin help prevent preeclampsia? A: There is some evidence that aspirin in low doses can have a protective effect against preeclampsia in women who are at high risk of the condition, especially those who have had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy. The dosage range is between 75mg and 150mg a day. It’s not clear whether it’s safe to take higher doses during pregnancy. Do not begin taking aspirin without consulting a doctor."

    "overview": "Pregnancy describes the process from conception to giving birth Some signs you’re pregnant are spotting, sore breasts and nipples, morning sickness, tiredness and sudden cravings The first symptoms of pregnancy are often already noticeable before you find out you missed your period\n\nPregnancy symptoms can start during the first weeks of pregnancy and can vary from woman to woman. Recognizing the earliest pregnancy symptoms can help you find out you’re pregnant early on. In this guide by Ada’s medical team, you’ll find more information about the different stages of pregnancy, the signs of being pregnant, how soon you can feel pregnancy symptoms, and the possible risks and complications of pregnancy.",
    "what_is_pregnancy": "Pregnancy is a term describing the period in which a fetus develops inside the mother’s uterus. This period starts from the moment that a woman’s egg is fertilized until birth. This period lasts for about 40 weeks , which equals to just over 9 months. You can get pregnant from sexual intercourse or through other methods such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). 1",
    "what_are_the_different_stages": "Pregnancy is divided into three different trimesters . During each trimester, the fetus develops a bit more and you can notice different symptoms of pregnancy. The first trimester of pregnancy starts when the sperm penetrates the egg and fertilizes it. The fertilized egg will then travel to the uterus and implant itself. These cells will start to multiply and a placenta will form that provides nutrients and oxygen from the mother to the fetus. This trimester takes about 3 months. During the first trimester, you can experience some of the early symptoms of pregnancy. 1 During the second trimester , which lasts from week 13 to week 28, the fetus continues to develop. During this time, a mother will be able to feel the movement of her baby, and the sex of the baby can be determined. Most women find that they experience less symptoms of pregnancy during this trimester. 1 The third trimester of pregnancy lasts from week 29 to child delivery, which usually happens around week 40. During this trimester, your baby will continue developing until the delivery and you may experience some hindrances like difficulties in moving or sleeping comfortably  as your belly will continue to grow. 1",
    "what_are_the_signs": "Pregnancy signs can look different from woman to woman. After conception, you will notice that you’ve missed your menstrual period . There are however also other reasons to miss a period, so missing a period doesn’t always mean you’re pregnant. Most pregnancy symptoms will already show before missing your period. Some early pregnancy symptoms are: 2 3 Slight bleeding or spotting Sore, swollen breasts and nipples Fatigue Nausea, vomiting, and morning sickness Headaches Sudden cravings or aversions towards certain foods or smells Mood swings Frequent urination Heartburn Bloating Weight gain or loss During your second trimester , you can notice the same symptoms from early on in the pregnancy. You can also experience: 4 An increase in breast size Weight gain Vaginal discharge Braxton Hicks contractions Leg cramps The third trimester of your pregnancy can cause some other symptoms , such as: 4 Back pain Difficulty sleeping Braxton Hicks contractions Frequent urination Heartburn Bloating Constipation Hemorrhoids Some bleeding from the vagina Shortness of breath Swollen feet",

Once the test confirms your pregnancy, it’s important to visit your healthcare provider as soon as possible for further follow up. 5",
    "how_soon_do_pregnancy_symptoms_start": "The symptoms of early pregnancy start within the first few weeks after conception. Not every woman experiences the same symptoms. These symptoms also do not occur at the same time for everyone, so your symptoms could start a bit earlier or a bit later. Usually, women will start showing at week 12, although this can also vary from woman to woman. 6",
    "what_are_possible_pregnancy_complications": "Pregnancy can have complications in some cases. These complications can affect both the mother and her fetus. It’s important to follow up closely with your healthcare provider to manage conditions and to avoid serious complications. Some common pregnancy problems are: 7 High blood pressure Pregnancy diabetes Infections such as STIs can happen during conception and can pass from mother to the baby during the delivery Preeclampsia Preterm labor Miscarriage Stillbirth Depression and anxiety Severe nausea and vomiting Anemia Some groups of women have a higher risk of facing complications during pregnancy or delivery: Women suffering from underlying health conditions Women who are overweight Very young women or women over 35 Women carrying multiple fetuses Previous pregnancy complications: eg. a history of miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth may put a mother at higher risk in subsequent pregnancies. Cesarean delivery in the past - A previous C-section, especially if there were complications, may affect the current pregnancy and delivery risky lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol, or drug use during pregnancy. These can significantly increase the risk of complications, including birth defects and premature delivery. In case of a high-risk pregnancy, additional follow-up and early prenatal care is of the essence to deliver your baby without complications.",
    "how_to_prevent_pregnancy": "Pregnancy can be prevented through contraception . There are many different types of contraception, and it is helpful to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different methods with your healthcare provider or gynecologist. Some options are: 8 9 Oral contraceptives Male or female condoms Vaginal ring Intrauterine coils (a copper coil that sits inside the womb) Skin patches IUD Contraceptive injection Birth control implant Surgeries to tie or cut the fallopian tubes in women or the sperm duct in men",

    "condition": "Premature Labor",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/premature-labor/",
    "what_is_premature_labor": "Premature labor, or preterm labor, is labor that begins after the 20th week and before the 37th week of pregnancy. Labor is defined as the the beginning of regular contractions and the shortening of the cervix (opening of the womb). Most cases of premature labor occur between the 34th week and the 37th week. Premature labor is relatively common , taking place in roughly 7 in 100 single baby births. In pregnancies of twins or triplets, premature labor is even more common – the average delivery date for twins is the 37th week and for triplets, the 33rd week. 1 A variety of other factors, including smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, can also make premature labor more likely. Roughly 1 in 10 cases of premature labour will result in a premature birth. 2 In cases where the baby is sufficiently developed to survive after birth (usually babies older than 34 weeks), labor will generally be allowed to progress naturally. If the baby is less developed (pre-34 weeks), a variety of methods can be used to delay labor until the baby is sufficiently mature.",
    "causes": "In many cases, the cause of premature labor cannot be clearly identified. However, several factors are known to make premature labor more likely. Factors that make premature pregnancy more likely include: 1 3 Womb or cervical abnormalities Carrying twins or triplets Excess fluid in the womb (polyhydramnios) Placenta praevia (when the placenta attaches near or over the cervical opening) Cervical insufficiency (when the cervix begins to open prematurely) Fertility treatment (for the current pregnancy) Less than six months between two pregnancies Premature birth in previous pregnancy Premature rupture of membranes (waters breaking before labor has begun) in a previous pregnancy Late miscarriage in a previous pregnancy Factors concerning the pregnant woman’s health can also make premature labor more likely. These include: Having a urinary tract infection High blood pressure Preeclampsia , eclampsia or HELLP syndrome Problems with blood clotting Smoking Drinking alcohol during pregnancy Use of illegal drugs during pregnancy Stress Being under 18 or over 35 years old Vaginal infections may also make premature labour more likely. These include: Gonorrhea Chlamydia Syphilis Trichomoniasis Bacterial vaginosis Infections caused by Group B streptococci.",
    "symptoms_and_warning_signs": "The symptoms and warning signs of premature labor include: 1 The waters breaking (rupture of the membranes). The pregnant woman may feel a soft popping sensation, followed by a slow trickle or gush of clear or pinkish liquid from the vagina. In some cases, there may only be an increase in vaginal discharge. If the waters break, contractions may begin. These may be regular and are often painless. Other symptoms of premature labor include: An aching back Strong cramps (which may be painful) A need to urinate often Pressure in the pelvis Nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea The mucus plug in the cervix comes away These symptoms may also occur if an individual is not in premature labor. However, a pregnant woman experiencing any of these symptoms should contact their doctor or midwife urgently.",
    "premature_labor_diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms and a physical examination. This will involve a gynecological exam to see if the cervix (the opening to the womb) has opened as well as general checks on the health of the mother and baby. This may include: 1 Temperature, pulse and blood pressure checks A check of the baby’s heartbeat (to look for irregularities) A blood test and vaginal swab (to check for infection) An ultrasound",
    "premature_labor_treatment": "Treatment generally depends on how far along the pregnancy is and the general health of the mother and/or baby. Options available to doctors include: 1 4 Allowing labor to continue naturally. This is generally advised in pregnancies of 34 weeks or more, when the baby will be sufficiently mature to survive outside of the womb. Nevertheless, the birth should still take place in a hospital where specialist care can be administered should it be necessary. Artificially delaying birth to allow time for doctors to prepare the baby for birth (usually steroids will be used to mature the baby’s lungs) and transfer the mother to a specialist care unit. This option will generally be advised in pregnancies of under 34 weeks. Birth will normally be delayed for at least 48 hours, and ideally for longer if needed. Due to the possible complications, this option is usually avoided if possible. Accelerating delivery using medication or caesarean section. This option will typically be chosen if the mother and/or baby are unwell.",
    "premature_labor_prevention": "As the causes of premature labor are not always clear, prevention can be difficult. However, there are several steps a pregnant woman can take to help reduce the risk of premature labor. Being tested for and treating infections can help to prevent some cases of premature birth. Receiving treatment for STIs is important during pregnancy, as is avoiding food poisoning by not eating certain foods (such as raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurized milk and pâté) and maintaining high general hygiene standards (washing the hands regularly, for example). Certain lifestyle choices can also help reduce the risk of premature labor. Staying active through regular light exercise is generally advised for pregnant women – this will also boost overall wellbeing and help reduce the chances of conditions such as diabetes and preeclampsia, which can contribute to the onset of premature labor. 5",
    "premature_labor_complications": "The earlier a premature baby is born, the greater the risk of complications. Possible complications include: 6 Immature lungs are the main concern for babies born early. In most cases, a baby’s lungs are mature by roughly week 36 of pregnancy. Babies born earlier than this may be given steroids to help accelerate the maturation process. Immature lungs can increase the risk of further complications. These include: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): A condition involving irregular breathing and a lack of surfactant – a substance that helps prevent the lungs from collapsing – in the lungs. Transient tachypnea: A condition characterized by rapid shallow breathing. Pneumonia: An infection of the lungs that can cause breathing problems. Other possible complications include: Infection: Premature babies are at high risk of infection. For this reason, premature babies will be kept in an incubator to protect against bacteria. Jaundice : A yellowing of the skin caused by a lack of the substance bilirubin . See this resource on neonatal jaundice for further information. Anemia: A condition involving low levels of red blood cells in the blood.",

    "premature_labor_faqs": "Q: What happens if my waters break but I am not in labor? A: It is possible for the waters to break but for a woman to not be in labor, this is called preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes (P-PROM). If this happens, in most cases antibiotics will be administered to prevent infection (made more likely by the breaking of the waters) and steroids given to help mature the baby’s lungs. Doctors will generally aim to delay the birth until at least 34 weeks and after this induce labor artificially. 1"

    "condition": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd/",
    "what_is_premenstrual_dysphoric_disorder_pmdd": "Premenstrual dysphoric disorder, abbreviated to PMDD, is a severe type of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) . The majority of people who menstruate experience cyclical physical and emotional changes in the days leading up to their period, such as tender breasts and mood changes. The type and extent of premenstrual symptoms experienced varies from person to person; PMS may be very mild or more serious. In a small number of women, monthly PMS symptoms may be severe, possibly leading to a diagnosis of PMDD. 1 2 Symptoms of PMDD are generally similar to symptoms of PMS, but are significantly more intense. In PMDD, psychological symptoms may be more prominent. 2 Common symptoms of PMDD include: 3 ref4 Irritability Anger Anxiety Depression Tiredness Tension Bloating PMDD symptoms typically develop roughly 5-14 days before menstruation and generally interfere with a person’s wellbeing and daily life, for example by making interpersonal conflict more likely. Symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should go away within a few days of menstruating. 4 5 Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your symptom assessment in the free Ada app . The exact causes of PMDD are not clearly understood, though there is a clear link to the hormonal changes that a woman experiences as part of her monthly menstrual cycle. Some research suggests  that women who have PMS or PMDD may be sensitive to rising levels of the hormone progesterone , the level of which increases after the release of an egg from the ovaries (ovulation) each month. It has been suggested that fluctuating hormone levels, that occur during the menstrual cycle, may affect levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain and thus impact a person’s mood. 6 5 Treatment for PMDD is available. This may include one or more of the following: 2 Lifestyle changes Supplements and natural remedies Psychotherapy Antidepressant medication Hormone therapy, e.g. birth control pills Surgery With treatment strategies, most women are able to effectively manage the symptoms of PMDD. The condition may seem to come and go, and some months may be worse than others. PMDD will not be present after menopause. 6 5 7 PMDD is thought to affect an estimated 5-8 percent of women of all races and backgrounds. 4 2 8 Because many of the symptoms can be caused by – or mistaken for – other conditions, e.g. depression or thyroiditis , it is necessary to undergo a thorough health check before a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can be made. 6",
    "pmdd_symptoms": "Symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder may vary from person to person and from one menstrual cycle to the next, but commonly include the following: 3 4 2 6 5 7 8 9\n\nSevere irritability; this is often the most prevalent symptom 8 Extreme anger or aggression, rage Severe anxiety and/or tension Low self-esteem Lasting sadness Feelings of hopelessness Feeling overwhelmed or out of control Low mood or depression Mood swings Loss of interest in activities that are usually enjoyable Forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating Sleep disturbances, e.g. sleeping more or less than usual Appetite changes and/or food cravings\n\nTiredness Lethargy, lack of energy Breast swelling and tenderness or pain Bloating Nausea Diarrhea Weight gain Headaches Muscle and/or joint aches Swelling of the hands and/or feet While mild forms of these psychological and physical symptoms may be experienced in regular PMS, many of them are more extreme in PMDD. Symptoms are typically so severe that they interfere with the person’s ability to go about their daily life, for example, they may experience increased conflict with loved ones or difficulties focusing on work, causing great distress. 10 PMDD symptoms typically develop between a few days and two weeks before menstruation, worsening in the build-up to and peaking about two days before, the period. The symptoms tend to disappear within a few days after the beginning of menstruation and are absent until ovulation has once again occurred.",
    "pmdd_causes": "While it is not yet completely understood what causes symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome to develop in certain women, it is known that changing hormone levels play a key role. 6 5 It is thought that fluctuations in hormones following the release of an egg (ovulation) as part of the monthly menstrual cycle may affect the levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain, causing many of the psychological symptoms that characterize PMDD. Some women may be more sensitive than others to the effects of an increased level of progesterone in the body, which naturally occurs after ovulation, in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. 8 Today, it is generally agreed that PMDD is not caused by an “imbalance” in a person’s hormones, a theory that was once proposed as an explanation for the disorder. 6 5\n\nA number of factors may make a person more likely to develop premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It is thought that these may include: 6 8 11 9 12 13 Family history of PMS or PMDD Personal or family history of mental health conditions, e.g. depression or anxiety Stress Being overweight Being in one’s mid-20s or one’s 30s, which seems to be the average age range of onset; PMDD may worsen with age 14 15 16 History of early-life abuse",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can only be made by a medical professional, after careful consideration of the person’s symptoms. A doctor will usually begin by taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination. Though there are no specific laboratory tests for PMDD, blood tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions that may be causing symptoms, such as anemia or an underlying thyroid disorder . 3 8 The doctor will ask questions about the symptoms being experienced. To provide detailed information on when they occur and how often, it is recommended that anyone who is concerned that they may have PMDD, keep a daily symptom diary or chart for 2-3 months, including severity ratings of symptoms and dates of menstruation. 3 9 Details can be recorded in a notebook or by using a specialized app designed for people affected by PMDD, several of which exist. The free Ada app can also help track symptoms. Download the app or find out more about how it works .\n\nAccording to the criteria set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), for a PMDD diagnosis to be made, at least five of the following symptoms must be present cyclically during most menstrual cycles over the preceding year. These symptoms need to include at least one of the first four on the list. 8 Depressed mood, feeling hopeless, negative thoughts about oneself Anxiety, tension, feeling “on edge” Unstable emotions, e.g. suddenly becoming sad or a heightened sensitivity to rejection Lasting anger or irritability, or an increase in fighting with loved ones Loss of interest in activities that are normally enjoyed Difficulty concentrating Lethargy, becoming tired easily or lack of energy Appetite changes, eating too much or food cravings Sleep disturbances, including sleeping too much or insomnia Feeling overwhelmed or out of control Physical symptoms, e.g. tender breasts, headaches, body pain, bloating For a diagnosis of PMDD to be made, the symptoms need to be present most of the time during the week before menstruation and go away within a few days after menstruation begins, being absent in the week after the period. Additional criteria require that: 8 Symptoms must be so severe that they significantly interfere with the person’s daily functioning Symptoms must not be caused by another disorder, e.g. depression or bipolar disorder Symptoms must be documented and rated on a daily basis by the person, for a minimum of two menstrual cycles\n\nIn many cases, a person’s symptoms may be related to a different condition. Symptoms of major depression , anxiety , bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions may become worse in the build-up to menstruation, which may lead to them being mistaken for PMS or PMDD. This is called premenstrual exacerbation (PME) of symptoms. 9 17 It is generally possible to tell the difference between PMDD and another disorder by tracking symptoms over a few months. PMDD symptoms are expected to be cyclical and only present for a few days to two weeks before one’s period. However, symptoms of a mood disorder like depression are expected to be also present, to some degree, outside of that pattern. Furthermore, during pregnancy or after menopause , PMDD symptoms will not be present. Differentiating PMDD from other mental health conditions is important, as treatment approaches differ. 9 17 It is possible to have both PMDD and another condition, like depression. 17",
    "pmdd_treatment": "There are a number of possible treatments for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These include antidepressant medications, hormone therapies, lifestyle changes and other remedies. The most appropriate treatment strategy for a particular person will be determined after considering their symptoms, general health, circumstances and preferences.\n\nMedication recommended for the treatment of PMDD includes antidepressants, hormone therapy and painkillers.\n\nIn many cases, a doctor will recommend a low dose of an antidepressant for the treatment of PMDD. This will usually take the form of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), which may increase the levels of serotonin in the brain and provide relief from symptoms of PMDD, particularly mood symptoms. This type of medication does not suppress ovulation. While considered effective for many people, SSRIs may cause unpleasant side-effects in some women and might not be suitable for everyone. 6 5 8 11 9 14\n\nBirth control: Some women may find relief from PMDD symptoms with the use of a combined oral contraceptive pill which contains synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone, the hormones involved in the menstrual cycle. By preventing ovulation from occurring each month, these hormonal contraceptive pills may help to reduce premenstrual symptoms. However, they may cause unpleasant side-effects and may not provide relief for everyone, even worsening cyclical symptoms in some cases. 3 4 6 5 8 14 Estrogen patch: Another option is an estrogen patch, gel or implant, which also suppresses ovulation. However, this may cause unpleasant side-effects in some women, and those who have not had a hysterectomy will need to take a progesterone medication, too, to lower the risk of developing uterine cancer that may be otherwise associated with this treatment. 6 5 8 11 Good to know: Taking a progesterone-only supplement is not considered an effective treatment for PMDD and should be avoided, unless it forms part of a combined hormone therapy recommended by a licensed doctor. 5 11 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists: These medicines, which are usually administered in the form of an injection, trigger a temporary menopause, providing relief from PMDD symptoms. However, they can cause very unpleasant side-effects and are only recommended in severe cases of PMDD where other treatments have not worked. GnRH medicines typically need to be taken with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent the development of menopausal symptoms and to reduce the risk of bone weakening and osteoporosis that may occur with long-term use. 6 5 8 11\n\nBenzodiazepines: These anti-anxiety drugs may sometimes be recommended for relief from symptoms of PMDD, particularly anxiety. However, they are highly addictive and should be used with extreme caution, if at all. 9 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These and other types of painkillers may be recommended for relief from pain that occurs as part of PMDD. 4 8\n\nSome women may find talk therapy in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helpful in the management of PMDD symptoms. 6 5 14 CBT may be recommended as part of a combined treatment approach or, in some cases, on its own.\n\nReducing stress: Taking steps to lower one’s stress levels by using relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation, practicing self-care and carefully scheduling work and other commitments, may be helpful. Tracking one’s menstrual cycle using a diary or app may be useful in anticipating the onset of troublesome symptoms of PMDD and planning around them. 2 6 5 14 Diet: It is thought that reducing one’s intake of caffeine, e.g. in coffee and tea, as well as sugar, salt and alcohol in the lead-up to menstruation may help to improve premenstrual symptoms to some extent. Eating complex carbohydrates, e.g. whole grains and starchy vegetables, instead of simple carbohydrates such as white bread and pastries, may also be recommended. In addition, increasing consumption of high-protein foods and having small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals, may have a positive effect in some women. However, more research is needed on the relationship between diet and premenstrual tension. 10 5 8 11 18 Exercise: Getting regular exercise is often recommended as part of the management of premenstrual symptoms, and many women may find it helpful. However, while moderate exercise is generally considered beneficial in promoting good health, further research is needed to confirm how effective it is in relieving symptoms of PMDD. 2 6 5 8 11 14 18 Stopping using tobacco products: It is recommended that a person quit using tobacco products to help with the treatment of PMDD or PMS. 2\n\nBefore taking any supplement or natural remedy for PMDD, it is important to consult a doctor. Some supplements and natural remedies may cause side-effects, or interact or interfere with medications, and may not be suitable for everyone. Calcium: Taking a calcium supplement in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, i.e. the lead-up to menstruation, has been shown to help with many premenstrual symptoms, including low mood, tiredness and bloating. The dose used in studies was 500-1200mg of calcium daily, in the form of tablets containing calcium carbonate, taken from 7-10 days after the start of a period. Further research is needed on the efficacy of calcium supplementation in PMDD specifically. 8 14 18 19 Magnesium : Though the results of studies have been mixed, and further research is needed, it is thought that taking a magnesium supplement may help to relieve some premenstrual symptoms in some women, such as water retention. 8 14 20 Vitamin B6: Also known as pyridoxine, it is thought that vitamin B6 may help to relieve premenstrual symptoms in some women. However, further research is needed. If a supplement is taken, it should not exceed 100 mg/day, as very high doses of vitamin B6 can lead to peripheral neuropathy, damage to nerves in the hands and feet. 10 14 18 Chasteberry: Also known as vitex agnus-castus , it is thought that chasteberry may help to relieve premenstrual symptoms in some women. However, further research is needed. Due to the possibility of hormonal effects, chasteberry should not be taken by: 6 14 18 20 19 21 22 23 24 Anyone who is trying to fall pregnant or is currently pregnant or breastfeeding Anyone who is on hormone-related medication, such as a birth control pill or HRT Anyone who has a hormone-sensitive condition, such as breast cancer Furthermore, as chasteberry may affect the neurotransmitter dopamine, it should be used with caution and only under medical supervision in anyone who is on dopamine-related medication, such as antipsychotic drugs or drugs for Parkinson’s disease . St. John’s Wort: Also known as hypericum perforatum , St. John’s Wort is a herb that is known to have antidepressant effects and may help to provide relief from premenstrual symptoms in some women. However, further research is needed on its efficacy. St. John’s Wort is known to interact with many drugs, including SSRIs and oral contraceptives. 14 18 20 19 25 Ginkgo biloba: It is thought that ginkgo leaf extract may help to relieve premenstrual symptoms in some women. However, further research is needed. Ginkgo supplements can cause serious side-effects, including increased risk of bleeding. The substance also interacts with many medications. 14 20 19 Evening primrose oil: Though popularly seen as a natural remedy for premenstrual symptoms, particularly breast tenderness, evening primrose oil has not been found to be effective in scientific studies and is not recommended for the treatment of PMDD. 8 14 Bright-light therapy: Involving the use of a special lamp or light box that emits frequencies of light similar to those experienced in bright sunlight, this type of therapy  is believed to have potential in the treatment of PMDD, but further research is needed before it can be recommended by medical practitioners. 18 Acupuncture: Some women may report acupuncture as being of benefit in the relief of premenstrual symptoms. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend it. 18\n\nIn severe cases of PMDD where other treatments have not been effective or suitable, surgery may be considered. This takes the form of a major procedure in which the ovaries and often also uterus (womb) are removed. Because the surgery results in the onset of menopause , PMDD symptoms can be expected to disappear permanently. To prevent complications that can arise from early menopause, it is typically necessary to take estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after the surgery. Having a hysterectomy prevents a woman from being able to fall pregnant, so it is not considered an option for someone who may want to have children. Before recommending surgery, a doctor will typically suggest inducing a temporary menopause with (GnRH) agonists to see how well the person responds. 10 6 5 18 19",

    "pmdd_faqs": "Q: What are the main PMDD symptoms? A: While they vary from person to person, common symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder that lead a woman to see a doctor include: 6 Irritability Anger Anxiety Depression Tiredness Q: When are PMDD symptoms the worst? A: Symptoms tend to be most severe in the week before menstruation, peaking approximately two days before the period begins. 6 Q: Do I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)? A: If you think that you might have signs of PMDD, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult with a doctor. Only a licensed medical practitioner can diagnose a person with PMDD. Q: Are PMDD and PCOS linked? A: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder and polycystic ovary syndrome are not generally thought to be connected. The two are separate conditions and having one does not mean a person will also experience the other. PCOS is characterized by cysts on the ovaries and can cause irregular or absent menstruation, as well as other symptoms like excess hair growth and weight gain. It may also be associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety and/or sleep disorders. 26 If you think that you might have signs of PCOS, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult with a doctor. Q: Can PMDD cause depression? A: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder can cause symptoms of depression, which are expected to ease with menstruation each month. If depressive symptoms remain, it is advisable to consult a medical practitioner to rule out major depression and other types of depression, and other health conditions. Q: Can PMDD make you suicidal? A: Yes, in some cases PMDD can cause a person to have suicidal thoughts. They may feel overwhelmed and unable to cope, and struggle to see a way forward. However, it is important to remember that effective treatment is available. 27 If you are feeling suicidal, contact a helpline, doctor or emergency support services right away. Q: Can PMDD last all month? A: Because PMDD is related to the menstrual cycle, symptoms are not expected to be present all month. If symptoms of PMDD persist after menstruation and seem to be present throughout the menstrual cycle, it is advisable to consult a doctor about the possibility of other conditions being present, for example depression , bipolar disorder or a thyroid disorder . Q: Does PMDD affect fertility? A: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not thought to affect fertility, and has not been shown to be associated with infertility in a woman. 28 Q: Does PMDD get better after menopause? A: Yes. Because ovulation and the menstrual cycle cease after menopause, PMDD can be expected to disappear too. This is the case in menopause that occurs naturally with aging, as well as menopause that is induced by medication or the surgical removal of the ovaries in younger women. 10 Read more about Menopause »"

    "what_is_a_pressure_ulcer": "A pressure ulcer, also known as pressure sore or bed sore, is a wound caused by prolonged pressure on the skin. Typical locations for pressure sores are are the heels, ankles, hips and over the tailbone. Elderly people and bed- or wheelchair-bound are at risk of developing this condition. Symptoms may include pain in the area, red or purple skin, a break in the skin and, eventually, a wide-based sore which may get bigger over time. The diagnosis is usually easily based on the symptoms and appearance of the area of skin. Treatment involves taking steps to avoid pressure on the area, to keep the wound healthy and, if needed, to close the ulcer. If the wound is small, it may heal well, but large, complicated ulcers can take weeks to months to heal.",
    "risks_for_pressure_ulcer": "Pressure on the skin is the main cause of pressure sores. A common cause is lying on a certain part of the body for a longer time, although some people develop this condition due to something (such as a device or rough surface) rubbing repeatedly on the the skin. This persistent pressure on one area causes breakdown of the upper layers of skin. If the pressure continues, it can also cause damage to the fat and muscle layers underneath. Normally, the pressure causes discomfort long before the skin becomes damaged, and people turn or move to relieve the discomfort. This condition occurs most commonly in people who are either unaware of pressure causing discomfort, or who are unable to turn themselves to relieve the pressure. Elderly people and those people who are bed-bound are most at risk of this condition. People who have had a spinal cord injury or another neurological condition which affects movement and sensation are also at increased risk. People with conditions which affect blood circulation, such as diabetes or chronic venous insufficiency may also develop pressure sores more easily.",
    "pressure_ulcer_symptoms": "Typical symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, skin that is softer and thinner than the surrounding skin, a break in the skin, and an open sore with a wide base. These tend to occur in bony areas, such as over the tailbone, hips ankles and heels, although they can occur in other areas. There may be pain in the affected area, if the affected person does not have a loss of feeling which has contributed to the formation of the sore. If there is an infection, there may be pus in the sore, or it may have an unpleasant smell. Concerned that you or a loved one may have pressure ulcer?

    "condition": "Prostate Cancer",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/prostate-cancer/",
    "what_is_prostate_cancer": "Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate gland, a walnut-shaped gland which sits just below the bladder in males. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It tends to affect men over the age of 50, and becomes more common with age. Many people have no symptoms in the early stages, but when they occur, symptoms include difficulties with urination, weight loss and tiredness. As prostate cancer only causes symptoms as it progresses, screening (testing people without symptoms) can help to identify the cancer in the early stages. Treatment depends on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread at the time of diagnosis. This condition most often progresses slowly, and many people recover well with treatment.",
    "what_are_the_risks": "Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them and can spread to other parts of the body. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that sits snugly underneath the bladder. It forms the first part of the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the bladder) and produces secretions that make up semen. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. It tends to affect men after the age of 50, and becomes more common with age. Men with a family member who has had prostate cancer have a slightly increased risk of this condition. Men who have African heritage also have a slightly higher risk than men from other backgrounds.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "There may be no symptoms in the early stages of prostate cancer. Urinary symptoms are common as the cancer progresses, and include difficulty beginning urination, a weak stream of urine and dribbling at the end of urination. As the cancer further progresses, some people may experience unintended weight loss, tiredness and general signs of illness may be present.",
    "how_is_prostate_cancer_diagnosed": "The diagnosis may be suspected based on the symptoms and a physical examination where a hard, knobbly prostate is felt. Blood tests and scans (ultrasound or CT scan) are also done. The diagnosis is confirmed when a small sample of the prostate (a biopsy) is taken and shows signs of prostate cancer.",
    "can_prostate_cancer_be_treated": "There are multiple options for treating prostate cancer, depending on the size of the cancer and whether it has spread. The general health of the affected person also influences the choice of treatment. As prostate cancer often develops very slowly, a doctor may recommend regular check-ups with no other treatment for people with a small cancer, especially in older men or men in poor health. Prostate cancer which requires treatment often involves removing the prostate, along with hormonal therapy, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. If the cancer is not curable, people with prostate cancer are offered treatments which aim to improve their symptoms and quality of life.",

    "condition": "Prostatectomy (Prostate Surgery)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/prostatectomy-prostate-surgery/",
    "what_is_a_prostatectomy_prostate_surgery": "A prostatectomy is a major procedure, carried out by a urological surgeon (urologist), in which all or part of the prostate gland is removed in men. It can be ordered by your doctor to treat prostate cancer and as part of treating some of the other types of cancer that can affect the pelvic region. A prostatectomy can often cure prostate cancer if it has not spread outside the prostate gland. Prostatectomies are also performed in the treatment of non-cancerous conditions affecting the prostate, such as: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), when the gland becomes enlarged and causes urinary problems Prostatitis, in which it becomes inflamed (in rarer cases) There are several different types of prostatectomy . The prostate surgery option used depends on why the procedure is being performed: A radical prostatectomy will be carried out as a treatment for malignant cancer. The surgeon will remove the entire prostate gland as well as the vas deferens , the duct which conveys sperm from the testicals to the urethra, and the seminal vesicles , the glands which hold the liquid which mixes with sperm to make semen. A simple prostatectomy , in which only part of the prostate is removed, will be carried out to treat a more benign condition, such as BPH. Prostatectomies generally require general anesthesia , i.e. a kind of anesthesia where the person is asleep during the procedure and does not wake up till the surgery is entirely finished, and a hospital stay of two to three days on average. Recovery time after prostate surgery usually takes a total of around one to two months. Life after the procedure requires taking care to allow the surgery site to heal properly, which will involve using a temporary catheter ‒ a thin, flexible tube ‒ to assist with urination during recovery. Blood in urine is common during the early stages of recovery, particularly while the catheter is in place. Removal of the prostate may result in complications, including impotence, which in most cases is temporary. Several different types of treatment exist to help correct erectile dysfunction after the operation. This is called penile rehabilitation therapy.",
    "what_is_the_prostate_gland_and_why_is_a_prostatectomy_performed": "A prostatectomy is performed in order to treat a variety of conditions which can affect the prostate gland . This gland is the size of a walnut and is located inside the male body, beneath the bladder and between the bladder and the penis. Women also have a gland which is equivalent to it, commonly referred to in medicine as the paraurethral gland or Skene’s gland, but they are much less likely to be affected by problems in this area than men. In healthy males, the prostate gland produces prostate fluid , one of the main components of semen. It also contains muscle fibres. During ejaculation, it functions to push the semen into the urethra, the duct which conveys both urine and semen out of the body. Prostate problems most commonly develop in later life , predominantly affecting men over 50 years of age. Problems, which may be addressed by a prostatectomy, include prostate cancer, enlargement and inflammation (prostatitis). If you are concerned that you, or a loved one, may be experiencing problems related to the prostate, get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common type of cancer in American males, after skin cancer, affecting around 1 in 7 men in the U.S. at some point during their lifetime. 1 Typically, it does not show any specific signs in its early stages and is usually detected during screening tests. When present, symptoms that often relate to its more advanced stages may include: 2 Fatigue Loss of appetite and weight loss Inability to completely empty the bladder, i.e. urinary retention Hematuria: blood in urine, which is visible to the eye or microscopically visible Incontinence and erectile dysfunction Signs of late-stage prostate cancer may include pain in the lower back and/or bones, and lymphedema; localized swelling related to excess lymph-fluid-accumulation, due to blocked lymph drainage paths. The recovery rates for prostate cancer are more favorable than for many other types of cancer. This is because the condition progresses comparatively slowly, so it is often possible to identify and treat the cancer before it reaches a critical stage of advancement. In addition to prostate cancer, a prostatectomy may also be carried out to treat or manage other cancers that affect the pelvis, such as bladder cancer and rectal cancer. Good to know: Sometimes, prostate cancer returns after a prostatectomy. This may happen if the cancer had advanced to a later stage than was thought when the surgery was carried out. When a person redevelops prostate cancer after prostate surgery, it can affect the area where the gland used to be, the surrounding area or nearby, or even parts of the body that are farther away, which the cancer cells have spread to. Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is known as advanced prostate cancer.\n\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. It can be used initially as a treatment instead of surgery. If a person has already had all of their prostate removed (a radical prostatectomy) when their cancer returns, then non-surgical options may be recommended. These may include radiation therapy ‒ which may be referred to by doctors as salvage radiation therapy ‒ or radiation therapy combined with hormone therapy. 3\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia is also referred to as prostate enlargement. 4 Prostate enlargement is unrelated to cancer, and the likelihood of developing prostate cancer is not increased by having this condition. The enlargement of the prostate occurs as men age, and it can grow to the extent that it begins to exert pressure on the urethra. This can cause discomfort and precipitate problems within the urinary system, including: 5 Urinary urgency: A strong urge or perceived need to urinate, which may be accompanied by pain and/or fear of urine leakage. Urinary frequency: The need to urinate frequently, usually in small quantities, during the night (nocturia) and day. Hematuria: Blood may be present in urine. This is due to the fact that the enlargement of the prostate gland, that occurs during BPH, can increase the frequency of breakages in the blood vessels, particularly after physical activity. This often results in recurrent (repeating) episodes of hematuria, until BPH is treated. Problems associated with BPH can sometimes be managed by taking medication which reduces the size of the prostate and helps to relax the muscles in and around the bladder. In some cases, however, a prostatectomy is necessary in order to relieve the symptoms.\n\nThe definition of prostatitis is when the prostate gland becomes swollen and inflamed. Prostatitis often occurs as the result of a bacterial infection, caused by bacteria which enter via the bladder or urethra and then infect the prostate. The symptoms of prostatitis include difficulties urinating or starting to urinate, pain which occurs specifically when ejaculating and/or in the perineum (the area between the scrotum and the anus) and generalized pain in the genitals, buttocks and pelvis. Prostatitis can often be managed or treated using medication to shrink the prostate gland, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication called alpha-blockers . In chronic cases of prostatitis, where the symptoms cannot be managed or treated by medication, the prostate may be removed by a special type of prostatectomy called a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) .",
    "types": "There are several different methods for performing a prostatectomy and several different types of prostatectomy, each appropriate to the treatment or management of different prostate-related conditions. The main types of prostatectomy are: Radical prostatectomy Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) Before a person undergoes the procedure, their urologist will discuss the intended route of surgery, and they will decide together on the best method. It is always important to find out whether or not the prostatectomy is intended to be nerve-sparing, an approach which ideally preserves the ability to have an erection, and general sexual function.\n\nThis type of operation is generally performed on people who are affected by prostate cancer . It involves removing the prostate gland in its entirety. If there is a possibility that prostate cancer has advanced to these areas, the surgeon may also remove the surrounding tissues, lymph nodes (small pieces of tissue which should filter and clear liquid waste transported in so called lymph fluid) and the seminal vesicles.\n\nProstatectomies can compromise a man’s ability to produce or sustain an erection. A nerve-sparing prostatectomy is an innovation on the usual surgical procedure for a radical prostatectomy, in which the surgeon takes special care to spare the two cavernous nerve sheaths . These are clusters of nerves which lie to the sides of the prostate gland. Their function in healthy males is to produce erections. 6 In this type of surgery the surgeon will stimulate the nerves electrically and measure erectile functionality using a machine called a penile plethysmograph 6 which measures the blood flow to the penis. This helps the surgeon to perform the surgery without cutting the nerves responsible for erectile function. It is not always possible to carry out a nerve-sparing prostatectomy successfully. The surgeon’s technical skills and experience will greatly impact the chances of preserving erectile function. Also crucial to the success of this procedure are the age and previous erectile abilities of the male undergoing the procedure.\n\nTURP is predominantly used for people who are affected by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) , a non-cancerous enlargement of the gland. By removing parts of it that press on the urethra, TURP may reduce problems related to urination. This operation is specifically designed to remove the inner part of the gland which surrounds the urethra. Rather than cutting the skin to perform the operation, the urologist will insert an instrument called a resectoscope into the penis through the tip and extract the relevant tissue by burning it off with an electrical current or vaporizing it. Unlike BPH, it is not possible to cure prostate cancer using the TURP procedure. However, the operation is sometimes recommended for men who are experiencing the advanced stages of prostate cancer.",
    "surgical_methods_for_performing_a_prostatectomy": "Traditionally, prostatectomies are carried out by open surgery , in which the surgeon makes a single, long incision in the skin and then removes the prostate gland and any other required surrounding tissues. However, due to technological advancements, it has become possible to carry out a prostatectomy using less invasive methods such as laparoscopic surgery (keyhole surgery) , or its subtype, robotic prostatectomy. Good to know: In cases where only part of the prostate is to be removed, it is possible to perform the procedure without cutting into the surrounding skin at all. For example, a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) can be performed by inserting a thin tube called a resectoscope into the bladder through the urethra to remove the prostate tissue. The three main surgical methods of prostatectomy are:\n\nThis surgical technique is also called bandaid surgery or minimally invasive surgery (MIS) . It is a modern method of performing operations through small incisions in the body, near the surgery site. One of the instruments will feature a video camera, which facilitates the surgeon seeing inside the body. Laparoscopic prostatectomies can usually be performed through incisions no bigger than 0.5 to 1.5 cm, and surgeons can perform this type of surgery by hand.\n\nRobotic prostatectomies are a type of laparoscopic prostatectomy. Rather than performing the operation by hand, a robotic arm is used to hold the surgical tools. This kind of prostatectomy may offer several advantages over the traditional laparoscopic prostatectomies, including: Clinically superior results Fewer complications Faster recovery Minimal scarring\n\nA radical prostatectomy can be performed using open surgery. This involves the surgeon making an incision into the lower belly in order to reach the prostate. This is called a retropubic approach . A retropubic radical prostatectomy is the most commonly performed type of prostatectomy. It is also possible to perform a prostatectomy through an incision made into the perineum (area between the scrotum and the anus). This is called a perineal approach and is associated with a shorter recovery time than the retropubic approach. 7\n\nRobotic prostatectomy is a fairly new method, meaning that it is not yet fully possible to make definitive comparisons between its results in the long-term and those of open surgery. However, research that has been carried out suggests that it is: 8 As effective as removing cancer as other types of surgeryLikely to result in less bleeding and scarring than open surgeryOften associated with a shorter hospital stay and a shorter postoperative (after surgery) recovery time, due to being less invasiveGenerally associated with a shorter period of postoperative urinary incontinence",
    "preparing_for_a_prostatectomy": "The time between a prostate condition being diagnosed and a prostatectomy being scheduled varies depending on the particular person and the advancement of their specific condition. In cases where a prostatectomy is being carried out because of prostate cancer, there is often an interval of six or more weeks between the diagnosis – which involves taking a biopsy – and the scheduling of the operation. This is to allow any inflammation, that has occurred as a result of the biopsy, to heal. These actions and forward-planning measures are helpful in preparing to undergo a prostatectomy: Kegel exercises : Schedule an appointment to learn Kegel exercises before the operation. These strengthen the muscles around the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) and will assist the process of regaining normal urinary function after the catheter, which is regularly administered after surgery, is removed. They should be practiced before and after prostate surgery. Hospital stay : A prostatectomy is an inpatient procedure that will require a hospital stay of two to three days, in general, after which it is possible to return home. Preparing for this, logistically and emotionally, will make this period run as smoothly as possible. Time off work : Recovery time after a prostatectomy is variable, but it will usually be necessary to book up to several weeks off work. Some people return to non-physical work such as a desk job after only a few days. However, it can take up to six weeks or, in rare cases, even longer to recover sufficiently to return to work after open prostate surgery. The recovery time for returning to work after a laparoscopic prostatectomy is usually shorter, often between two and three weeks. Avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) : Certain painkillers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, may affect blood clotting . Using them before surgery can result in excessive bleeding. If needed, acetaminophen (Tylenol or Paracetamol) may be suitable to prevent minor aches and pains. However, no painkiller products should be used in the period before surgery, without first consulting a doctor to check that they are suitable. These medicines and dietary modifications are helpful preparations for the day before the surgery is due to take place : Bowel preparation : In order for the surgery to be performed properly, it is vital that the bowel is empty and clean. The doctor will prescribe a bowel preparation to be taken the day before the surgery in order to help remove waste from the area. Avoid solid food : To prevent the body from creating more feces and compromising the cleanliness of the bowel, it is important to avoid solid food for the day before the surgery and ingest only clear liquids . Avoid eating or drinking on the day of the surgery : Because general anaesthesia will normally be used to do a prostatectomy, it is important to avoid ingesting anything for a certain time frame before the surgery takes place. Generally, the recommended time frame varies a bit between medical practices; drinking small amounts of  clear fluids like water is generally considered to be fine, up two to three hours prior to the surgery. People are usually recommended to avoid eating after midnight or earlier the night before the surgery takes place, but, in each case, always follow the specific guidelines given by the surgeon or anesthesiologist .",
    "during_the_procedure": "Prostatectomies, depending on the type, usually take about one or two, and, in rarer cases, for more complicated open radical prostatectomies, three hours for the urologist to perform, with the whole surgical procedure, including sedation and waking up, usually lasting two to four hours in total. Immediately after the surgery, a temporary subrapubic catheter (a thin tube) is inserted through the penis or, alternatively, through an incision in the abdomen, in order to streamline the process of urination during recovery. The catheter serves to prevent urine coming into contact with the healing area and often stays in place for about seven days, but this may also vary greatly, depending on the procedure performed or the patient’s specific recovery progress.",
    "life_after_prostate_removal_postoperative_care_and_recovery": "The duration of time people stay in hospital after their prostatectomy varies, though it will usually be between two and three days. However, if open surgery is performed this timeframe may rise to seven or more days in hospital, depending on which hospital and country the surgery is performed in. After this, it will be necessary to spend some recovery time at home while the surgery site heals; the length of this may vary depending on the type of operation. It is possible, particularly if the procedure was a laparoscopic prostatectomy, to recover sufficiently to return to work after a period of two to three weeks. Nearly everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy recovers sufficiently to return to work after six weeks. As soon as the operation is complete, and while the person undergoing the procedure is still in the operating room, a temporary suprapubic catheter will be inserted to assist them in urinating during the immediate recovery process. A suprapubic catheter is a hollow, flexible tube which is inserted into the bladder through an incision in the stomach above the navel (tummy button). The catheter is left in place for one or two weeks and helps drain the urine from the bladder whilst the area, which has undergone surgery, is healing. In some cases, instead of the suprapubic catheter, a transurethral catheter leading from the exit of the urethra at the tip of the penis to the bladder may be inserted. People who have undergone a prostatectomy should expect to see a small amount of postoperative bleeding after the catheter has been removed; this is during urination in the days after the surgery and lasts for up to a maximum of six weeks after surgery. While the catheter is still in place, some blood and/or blood-like debris are likely to be visible in the urine collection system; this is normal, especially during the first few days after surgery. In addition to the catheter, a range of devices and techniques are recommended to promote healing during the immediate recovery period :\n\nPostoperative pain when sitting can be avoided by using a circular cushion with a hole in the middle, and which is called a donut cushion ; this allows the wearer to sit down without putting pressure on the surgery site.\n\nThis will help ensure that the urinary system functions as healthily as possible while it is recovering from surgery and will also keep the body hydrated. Taking care to stay hydrated is also necessary, because the affected person will be using stool softener in the postoperative period to avoid constipation.\n\nIt is normal to be affected by constipation after undergoing surgery. The doctor will prescribe a suitable stool softener to help maintain healthy bowel function. Good to know: Stool softener can cause dehydration as many types work by drawing liquid from the body into the stool; it is therefore especially important to stay well hydrated. A person’s healthcare team can advise on the right amount of water to drink, relative to the type of stool softener they are using.\n\nThese should be practiced before and after the operation to keep the pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder and urine flow, operational as directed by a doctor. The three areas which are strengthened by Kegel exercises are the bladder which holds the urine, the pubococcygeus muscle which supports the bladder and rectum, and the sphincter urethrae, which helps open and close the urethra. Kegel exercises can help a person to recover from the incontinence caused by undergoing a prostatectomy, which is temporary in most cases.\n\nOther than the Kegel exercises, it is advisable to limit other physical exercise and heavy lifting during the recovery period. Walking around gently at intervals during the day is recommended, however, to prevent blood clots forming in the groin and legs.\n\nUrologists advise people who have undergone a prostatectomy to explore the resumption of sexual activity as soon as they feel ready. Even if it is not immediately possible to produce an erection sufficient for performing full sexual intercourse, stimulating the area will help the nerves and muscles involved in producing an erection become used to doing so. Men who have had a successful nerve-sparing prostatectomy tend to recover their erectile abilities quickly. </br>For men who have had a non-nerve-sparing or unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomy, the process of regaining erectile function can take longer. Medications and/or devices can be prescribed in these cases. In the rare event of a prostatectomy resulting in chronic impotence , surgical procedures such as the insertion of penile implants can help.\n\nMost people will experience some pain in and around the area which has undergone surgery, as well as some pain related to wearing the catheter. The doctor will prescribe suitable painkillers and give advice on how frequently to take them.\n\nPeople who have undergone a prostatectomy will be taught how to operate the catheter before they leave hospital after the operation. The operation of most catheters is relatively similar and involves collecting the urine in a drainage bag, which can then be emptied into the lavatory. The drainage bag must be changed at appropriate intervals. All men normally experience some level of incontinence (leakage of urine) after the catheter has been removed, particularly after involuntary bodily actions such as sneezing or laughing. It is also common to experience sudden impulses to urinate while the catheter is in place. This is called a bladder spasm . Bladder spasms should ideally not be particularly painful or occur very often. Therefore, it is wise to consult the doctor if they occur frequently enough to be bothersome or are accompanied by acute pain. For most men, urinary problems are temporary and are effectively resolved by practicing pelvic floor and Kegel exercises regularly, as recommended by the doctor. Pads should be worn whilst urinary leakage is occurring and changed throughout the day as needed. Very rarely, men who have undergone a prostatectomy develop a permanent kind of urinary incontinence called chronic urinary incontinence . If urinary incontinence remains a problem after the catheter has been removed, further surgical procedures will be considered to treat the incontinence. For example, the insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter, a device which regulates the release of urine from the bladder, may need to be considered as an option.\n\nAll prostate surgery procedures disrupt the nerves and blood vessels that control the way erections form. For this reason, all prostatectomies will compromise erectile function, at least initially. Up to 50 percent of men who have had a successful nerve-sparing procedure, i.e. the nerves were left untouched as planned during the procedure, regain their pre-prostatectomy (before surgery) erectile functionality within one year. For men who have not had nerve-sparing procedures, it is usually still possible to recover most or the entire extent of their pre-treatment erectile capability. Prostate surgery can alter the sensation of the male orgasm . In some men, the orgasm ceases to be as intensely pleasurable or ceases to be pleasurable at all. This change in sensation is principally caused by the fact that, in radical prostatectomies, both the glands which make seminal fluid and the vas deferens (the sperm ducts) are no longer operational, so the male orgasm must occur without the ejaculation of semen. Sometimes, especially common after TURP surgery, the semen ejected, will not leave the body, but be transported into the bladder; this is called retrograde ejaculation. Occasionally, men who have undergone a prostatectomy report experiencing pain when orgasming after they have recovered. It is possible for the pain – which usually affects the perineum and pelvis – to occur either occasionally, at regular intervals or every time the affected person engages in sexual intercourse. The incomplete removal of the seminal vesicles during the prostatectomy procedure is thought to be a principal cause of postoperative pain on orgasming. 9 Prostate removal effects on erectile function are influenced by factors including : 9 The skill of the urologist or urological surgeon : The greater their surgical experience and success rate at preserving sexual function, the more likely a given procedure is to conclude with this outcome. Age of the patient : Younger men are more likely than older men to keep or regain their erectile abilities. Previous sexual profile : The greater a man’s ability to produce erections before the procedure, the more likely he is to keep or regain it after the procedure. Doctors will usually encourage postoperative patients to consider resuming sexual activity as soon as the catheter is removed in order to preserve their penile function. The sooner after surgery a man begins exploring his erectile abilities, the more likely he is to regain most or all of his normal sexual functionality. This process is called penile rehabilitation . 10 The success of penile rehabilitation depends foremost on whether or not a man has undergone a nerve-sparing prostatectomy. Non nerve-sparing prostatectomies and unsuccessful nerve-sparing prostatectomies damage the two bundles of nerves associated with producing erections. If both bundles of nerves are sufficiently damaged, it may no longer be possible for a man to have spontaneous erections without the aid of devices or medications that assist the bodily process in cases when it can no longer happen naturally. However, in cases where spontaneous erections are no longer possible, there are several possible treatment options which may help with overcoming erectile dysfunction after a prostatectomy. These include: 11 12 13 Topical medications, such as Vitaros© Oral medications, such as Viagra® Vacuum devices Implants All of these medications work by increasing blood flow to the penis, causing an erection . See this resource for more information on erectile dysfunction .",
    "risks_and_side_effects": "As with any major surgical procedure, a prostatectomy carries certain risks and possible side effects. These include problems that can occur immediately after the surgery, such as an allergic reaction to substances in the anesthetic medication, as well as problems which can occur later on, for instance, the formation of blood clots or infections developing near the surgery site. Complications which can arise from the procedure can include :\n\nAll prostatectomies disrupt the normal flow of urine from the bladder and out of the penis through the urethra. For this reason, everybody who undergoes a prostatectomy will experience a period when they have difficulties controlling the speed and flow of their urination in the immediate aftermath of the procedure. Most men regain their bladder control after several weeks or months after the catheter is removed, particularly in cases when there are no other complications and Kegel exercises are practiced as recommended. Kegel exercises are designed to strengthen the muscles around the bladder, leading to better bladder control. Some people do not recover their bladder control. This is called continuous incontinence , which may be treated with further surgery and/or by using devices to regulate the flow of urine and control the bladder, such as an artificial sphincter .\n\nBecause all prostatectomies involve cutting internal tissue, and, in most cases, also external tissue, there is the potential for problematic bleeding to occur after the procedure has been performed. It is important to consult the doctor as soon as possible if bleeding, especially fresh blood occurs beyond the initial recovery period (see passage above) or if the bleeding is very strong in the initial period. Either circumstance may indicate a hemorrhage, and should therefore should be investigated. 14 If bleeding does continue after the catheter is removed, then it might be a sign of internal bleeding after surgery, and medical attention should be sought immediately.\n\nBlood clots that d evelop after the surgery tend to form in the legs or less commonly the groin area. Loose blood clots can then cause pulmonary embolism , a life-threatening condition in which the blood clot travels to the lungs and causes a blockage in the pulmonary artery, the blood vessel which carries the blood from the heart to the lungs. Walking around and consistently practicing pelvic floor exercises in the initial recovery period is an effective way to help prevent clots from forming.\n\nThis can occur in the event of a surgical error. Urologists are careful to perform the procedure as precisely as possible so as to minimize the risk of causing damage to the surrounding area. However, in rare cases, injury to the surrounding tissue and organs can still be sustained.\n\nIf a person has a history of swelling of the face or generalized itching, it is important to inform the anesthetist before the procedure because, although allergic reactions to anesthesia can be mild, involving only wheezing or some skin irritation, it is also possible to experience an anaphylactic response which can be life-threatening. Somebody suffering from an allergic reaction to an anesthetic may display signs like breathing difficulties, low blood pressure, rashes, hives and swollen skin around the eyes or mouth and throat. It is possible to perform tests prior to the surgery to identify which chemicals trigger an allergic reaction and if necessary an appropriate alternative anesthetic solution can then be chosen. 15 Other adverse reactions, such a muscle soreness, a sore throat from the breathing tube or nausea and vomiting after the surgery are a lot more common than allergic reactions. Around 10 percent of people will experience some kind of adverse reaction to anesthetic drugs 16 , and anesthetists are trained to recognise and treat reactions as and when they occur during or after surgery.\n\nThe parts of the body which are most likely to be infected after surgery are located in the abdomen (the belly). Infections after prostate surgery, if they occur, are usually due to the intestine being injured during surgery, which is more common in cases where the operation has been carried out by keyhole surgery than when an open approach has been used.\n\nThis is a rare complication of removing the lymph nodes around the prostate during prostate surgery. Removing any of the body’s lymph nodes can affect the lymphatic system. Functioning normally, the lymph nodes act as a drain for lymph fluid which circulates around the body. When this protein-rich fluid cannot drain out through the lymph nodes, it can build up and stagnate in the area of the body where the lymph nodes were removed, and infection-causing bacteria can pose a risk. 17 Common symptoms of lower-body lymphedema may include: 17 18 Heaviness and achiness in the genital area or legs Reddening of the skin in the genital area or legs Changes in the size and shape of the legs Swollen skin Reduced muscle and joint flexibility Always consult a doctor if lymphedema is suspected. If lymphedema is left untreated, the growing pool of undrained lymph can spread to surrounding areas of the body, such as the back and legs. 19 Treatment for lymphedema focuses on redistributing this buildup of lymph within the body, so that it can be drained by other, functioning, lymph nodes. This may involve: 20 Applying a compression system, such as a special bandage, to the affected area Manual lymph drainage, a specific type of massage performed by a doctor or occupational therapist Stretching exercises Deep breathing exercises A manual pump to use at home\n\nPelvic lymphocele is a possible complication of prostate surgery, most commonly associated with undergoing a radical prostatectomy . A lymphocele occurs when the local lymphatic system is compromised due to surgery as a result of which, a buildup of lymph drains into a nearby cavity, rather than being drained from the area where the lymph nodes were removed. 21 When lymphocele occurs after surgery, the buildup of lymph is usually found in the retroperitoneal space, i.e. behind the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and covers the abdominal organs. Lymphocele can be symptomless, and can resolve spontaneously, without the need for treatment. When symptoms of lymphocele do occur, they may include: Abdominal pain A sensation of fullness Reddened or swollen skin Constipation Urinary urgency or the need to urinate frequently Edema (swelling) of the genitals and/or legs Seek prompt medical attention if symptoms of lymphocele are present. The presence of symptoms indicates that the lymphocele has grown to a size, at which treatment will be required in order to remove it. Left untreated, lymphocele can cause other problems to develop, including obstruction of the urinary tract, obstruction of the blood flow to the surgery site and/or compression of nearby blood vessels, which will slow down the post-surgical healing process. In addition to a physical examination, an ultrasound or CT scan may be carried out in order to diagnose lymphocele. Treatment for symptomatic lymphocele may involve: 22 Marsupialization: This is a surgical technique which involves cutting a slit into the area occupied by the lymphocele and suturing it into an open position, creating a pouch shape and thereby allowing the buildup of lymph to drain freely out of the previously enclosed space. It is usually carried out as an outpatient procedure. Laparoscopic marsupialization has recently become the first line treatment for pelvic lymphocele, although it is also possible to perform marsupialization via open surgery. In laparoscopic marsupialization, a very small incision is made in the skin near the lymphocele; marsupialization can then be carried out robotically, using image guidance. 23 Percutaneous drainage: This procedure is carried out under local anesthetic and takes around one hour to perform. A small incision will be made in the skin near the site of the lymphocele. Doctors will use image guidance to insert a needle attached to a catheter into the lymphocele, and the fluid will then be drained out of the body, via the catheter, into a drainage bag. 24\n\nPerforming surgery other than TURP weakens the layers of pelvic tissue and muscle tissue of the lower belly where the incision was made. This can cause internal parts of the body, such as parts of the intestine, to gravitate from their normal location, causing pain and a distinctive bulge to form in the groin area. Men are ten times more likely to experience an inguinal hernia than women 25 , and their chances of developing the condition later on are significantly increased by having undergone an open surgery prostatectomy.\n\nGood to know: An additional, less common, post-surgical complication is Peyronie's disease . This condition causes a shortening and curvature of the penis and primarily affects men in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Peyronie’s disease shares this characteristic with most prostate-related conditions that require a prostatectomy, but there is little evidence to support or refute the idea that they are necessarily linked. 26 However, the shortening of the urethra, that can occur as a result of the surgery, can cause the penis to shorten and curve in a manner that is hard to distinguish or is even indistinguishable from the curvature caused by Peyronie’s disease.",
    "prostatectomy_faqs": "Q: Can a prostatectomy cause a change in penis length? A: Yes. It is very common for the penis length to decrease after prostate surgery, due to the fact that a portion of the urethra is often removed. Radical prostatectomies generally cause the greatest decrease in penis length. In most cases, the length of the penis is most diminished immediately after the procedure and the difference between its postoperative length and original length decreases as the person recovers. 27 Q: Can a prostatectomy cause loss of fertility? A: Radical prostatectomies are the type most commonly associated with a loss of fertility. This is because they involve cutting and/or removing the vas deferens , meaning that the sperm no longer have a conduit to travel from the testicles and out of the body in seminal fluid. A man who has had this type of surgery, can no longer father a child naturally, but can choose to save (bank) his sperm for future use before the operation. 28 It is important to talk to the doctor before the procedure is carried out and make arrangements if this is needed. Q: Is it possible to drive a car during the recovery period from a prostatectomy? A: One should avoid driving completely whilst the catheter is in place. After the catheter is removed, it is nevertheless advisable to avoid certain activities such as driving for two to four weeks after the operation and to confirm with one’s doctor that one is fit to resume them on a follow-up visit. Q: What precautions should I take to keep clean and promote healing while the temporary catheter is in place and after its removal? A: The subrapubic or transurethral cathether is a thin, flexible tube; a temporary device which is inserted after surgery in order to streamline urination during recovery. It is usually worn for around one or two weeks, during which time a person should keep the surrounding area as clean and dry as possible. This can be achieved by washing the rest of the body with a sponge or flannel, rather than bathing or showering fully. Drinking plenty of water is advised in order to keep the urinary system functioning normally. It is not unusual to experience some pain and/or irritation in the urethral area due to the presence of a transurethral catheter or some discomfort in the lower belly area if a suprapubic catheter is used. Suitable painkillers to take during the recovery process will be recommended by one’s doctor, and any irritation should clear up on its own once the catheter is removed. Some people may experience temporary urinary incontinence after the removal of the catheter. If this occurs, urinary pads should be worn until normal urinary function is restored."

    "condition": "Pulmonary Embolism",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/pulmonary-embolism/",
    "what_is_a_pulmonary_embolism": "A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a medical condition which occurs when one or more arteries in the lungs become blocked. When a pulmonary artery becomes blocked, blood flow can be restricted between the heart and the lungs. This can cause serious complications, such as low levels of oxygen in the blood, strain on the heart and damage to the lungs. 1 A blood clot is the most common cause of the blockage. 2 Blood clots most often form in the deep veins of the legs, from where they can detach and travel through the bloodstream towards the lungs, potentially causing a pulmonary embolism. Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can arise suddenly or progress gradually over a period of time. 3 If not treated quickly, a significant pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. The most common symptoms include: 1 4 Chest pain that often gets worse when taking deep breaths Shortness of breath Feeling faint Coughing up blood Treatment for pulmonary embolisms involves removing the blockage, usually through blood-thinning medications, which work to dissolve the blood clot. Surgery may also be recommended in specific cases, such as when medication hasn’t worked or if the person is at a high risk of death from the pulmonary embolism. 5 A pulmonary embolism is a serious condition that can result in significant complications and, in the most severe cases, death. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, most people make a full recovery. 6 If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have a pulmonary embolism , contact a doctor without delay. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "types": "Almost all cases of pulmonary embolism result from a blood clot that originates in the legs or pelvis. 7 However, in rare instances, other types of material can also cause a blockage, including: 1 4 Air bubbles in the bloodstream, which can occur through activities such as underwater diving, surgery and catheterization Fat, which can enter the bloodstream from bone marrow, usually during surgery or injury Amniotic fluid, which can enter the mother’s bloodstream during a complicated childbirth Cancer cells, which may clump together and enter the bloodstream. This is known as tumor emboli Foreign substances, which may enter the bloodstream, often due to intravenous drug use Good to know: A blood clot that forms in a vein is also known as a thrombus. An embolus describes any unattached material that travels through the bloodstream. 1",
    "causes": "The pulmonary arteries carry blood from the heart to the lungs. In the lungs, blood is oxygenated before it returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, where it is then pumped throughout the rest of the body. A pulmonary embolism is caused when one or more of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs become blocked. This blockage can be solid, liquid or gaseous in nature, but is most often caused by a blood clot. 2\n\nAlmost all pulmonary embolisms are caused by a blood clot that originates in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. 7 When a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the legs or pelvis, this is a condition known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A pulmonary embolism is caused when a blood clot, or part of a blood clot, breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, eventually causing a blockage in the arteries of the lungs. 4",
    "symptoms": "The severity of a pulmonary embolism generally depends on a number of factors, including: 1 2 4 8 The size of the blockage Where in the pulmonary arteries the blockage is The overall health of the affected person The age of the affected person The gender of the affected person The main symptoms that may indicate pulmonary embolism are: 1 2 4 Chest pain that often gets worse when taking deep breaths Shortness of breath Fast breathing Fast heart rate Feeling faint and dizzy Further possible symptoms of pulmonary embolism can include: 1 2 3 4 7 Coughing, including coughing up blood Feelings of anxiousness Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension Fever Fainting Painful leg swelling, if the cause is a clot in the leg Symptoms typically appear over a number of hours or days and can vary in frequency and intensity. 9 Some people with a pulmonary embolism may even be asymptomatic, i.e. not experience any symptoms at all. 3 7 Significant pulmonary embolisms can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. It is recommended that any person who suspects they have a pulmonary embolism contact their doctor immediately. Good to know: Because the signs of pulmonary embolism are so variable and many of the symptoms are shared with other conditions, diagnosis can be difficult. A doctor may suspect a pulmonary embolism after monitoring a person’s symptoms and noting any risk factors , but will then rely on a number of tests to help diagnose the condition. 1 Worried that you or a loved one may have a pulmonary embolism? Always contact a doctor when a pulmonary embolism is suspected. You can also download the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "risk_factors_for_pulmonary_embolism": "It is estimated that pulmonary embolisms affects around 350,000 people in the United States every year. 7 Because pulmonary embolisms are so often caused by blood clots, the risk factors for developing blood clots and experiencing a pulmonary embolism are often shared. It is estimated that 40-50 percent of people with deep vein thrombosis develop a pulmonary embolism. 10 Risk factors for pulmonary embolism include: 1 ref2 5 9 11 12 13 Age over 60 years old Prolonged periods of inactivity, that may be due to reduced mobility, such as after surgery or long travel Certain medical conditions, such as cancer and blood clotting disorders Family history of blood clots or embolisms Previous instances of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Major surgery or injury within the last four weeks Pregnancy Smoking Obesity Estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills have been linked to an increased risk of developing blood clots. However, the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to oral contraceptive pills is low, particularly in young, non-smoking people.",
    "diagnosing_pulmonary_embolism": "A doctor may suspect a pulmonary embolism based on a person’s symptoms and a physical examination, but further diagnostic tests are typically needed to confirm the diagnosis. 4 Many diseases and illnesses that affect the heart and lungs share at least one symptom with pulmonary embolisms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath or increased heart rate. Therefore, doctors will need to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as temporary lung changes that can happen after surgery, pneumonia and acute heart failure . 14\n\nWhen considering the diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism, a doctor will typically check a person’s symptoms against a points-based clinical criteria known as Wells criteria. According to this criteria, certain symptoms and circumstances receive a specific numerical point score. Examples include: 2 Clinical symptoms of deep vein thrombosis – score of 3 Previous instance of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis – score of 1.5 Coughing up blood – score of 1 The final score a person receives helps a doctor to assess the overall likelihood of a pulmonary embolism. In turn, this can influence which diagnostic tests may be most suitable for them. 3\n\nA definitive diagnosis of pulmonary embolism can often be made through a CT scan. 2 A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays in multiple layers to gain a view of the inside of the body. A version of this, called CT angiography, is the imaging test most often used to diagnose a pulmonary embolism because it can generate a detailed view of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. During CT angiography, a contrast dye is injected into the person’s veins. Once the dye has traveled through the bloodstream to the blood vessels of the lungs, a CT scanner will be used to generate an internal image of the body. Because the dye shows up clearly on the scan, any evidence of an obstruction in the pulmonary arteries is usually very apparent. 1 Other imaging tests that might be suggested include: 1 2 4 15 Pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scans, also known as a V/Q scan, are often suggested as an alternative to CT angiography when CT angiography is not available or appropriate. A V/Q scan measures the air and blood flow in the lungs. It involves imaging the lungs with a special device after a person has inhaled a radiolabeled gas and once a radiolabeled dye has been injected into a person’s veins. Radiolabeling is a technique whereby a gas or liquid is joined by a radioactive substance, allowing its passage through the human body to be tracked. Chest X-ray is not often used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. However, it can be useful in ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms, such as pneumonia . Pulmonary angiography is usually only conducted if CT angiography is not available. It involves threading a catheter into the pulmonary artery via a small cut in the skin. A dye is then injected into the artery through the catheter, and X-ray images are taken to monitor flow through the pulmonary artery.\n\nBlood tests are sometimes recommended as a diagnostic method for a suspected pulmonary embolism. Blood tests usually cannot confirm a diagnosis, but they may help to support or exclude a diagnosis. 3 For example, a blood test that measures a substance called the D-dimer is often suggested for people who are thought to have a low to moderate probability of a pulmonary embolism. If the level of the D-dimer in the blood is normal, then the likelihood of pulmonary embolism is very low and diagnosis can often be ruled out. 2\n\nFurther diagnostic tests that may be suggested to help support or exclude the diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism include: 1 2 3 4 Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG uses sensors attached to the body to monitor the heart’s electrical activity Echocardiogram uses soundwaves to generate an image of the heart Ultrasound tests can use sound waves to detect clots in the legs, which are the usual source of a pulmonary embolism Good to know: A CT angiography is considered the gold standard test to definitively diagnose a pulmonary embolism. While the majority of other tests may help to support a diagnosis, they typically cannot be used to confirm or rule out the condition. Therefore, a doctor may recommend a combination of diagnostic tests, guided by the affected person’s symptoms, history and score in the Wells criteria for pulmonary embolism.",
    "treatment": "** A pulmonary embolism is often a medical emergency.** Treatment depends on the severity of the blockage, but usually focuses on three stages: Making sure the affected person is stable by treating the most serious symptoms first. For example, providing oxygen to someone with trouble breathing Treating the blockage, which is usually accomplished by medications Taking steps to prevent future clots, including lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication\n\nPulmonary embolisms can cause potentially life-threatening symptoms, such as breathing problems and dangerously low blood pressure. Therefore, immediate treatment for a pulmonary embolism often focuses on treating these symptoms with treatment methods such as: 1 2 16 Additional oxygen, often given through a face mask or nasal tubes, to increase the amount of oxygen that reaches the lungs and raise the levels of oxygen in the blood Extra fluids, often through an intravenous drip, to help raise blood pressure Mechanical ventilation to assist breathing. It may be necessary if respiratory failure develops Pain-relief medication, such as acetaminophen/paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen\n\nOnce a person has been stabilized, doctors will usually move onto treating the blockage itself. This is usually done through attempts to either dissolve or physically remove the blockage.\n\nIf the cause of the blockage is a blood clot, immediate medication is generally required to thin the blood and dissolve the clot. Such medication is typically delivered intravenously and in hospital. The medication prescribed depends on the severity of the blockage, but usually falls into one of two categories: 1 5 17 Anticoagulants. Also known as blood-thinners, anticoagulant medication helps to prevent any existing blood clots from enlarging and also prevents new blood clots from forming. Different anticoagulation medications can be used for initial treatment as well as for longer-term therapy. Anticoagulants are often prescribed for at least three months following a pulmonary embolism. 2 At first, anticoagulant medications are usually administered intravenously, which means the medicine is injected directly into the veins or subcutaneously, which means injected just under the skin. However, long-term anticoagulant medications are often taken orally as a tablet. Thrombolytics. Also known as clot-busters, thrombolytic medication is only prescribed for life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism. Thrombolytics work quickly to dissolve blood clots. However, they carry the risk of causing significant bleeding, which is why they are only administered in emergency situations. Thrombolytic medications are usually administered intravenously. Good to know: In recent years, a device called the <em>EkoSonic Endovascular System</em> has been shown to be effective at accelerating thrombolytic therapy in a procedure called ultrasound-accelerated thrombolysis (UAT). This procedure uses a catheter that emits ultrasound waves in conjunction with the release of thrombolytic medication. The ultrasound waves are believed to help the drugs to penetrate and dissolve the clots more easily. 7 18 This technology can also possibly be used, without medication, in treatment of a pulmonary embolism in high-risk patients with active bleeding, who may not be suitable for thrombolytic therapy.\n\nPulmonary embolisms rarely require surgery, as medication is typically sufficient to treat the condition. However, in emergency situations where other treatment methods are either unavailable, unsuitable or have been unsuccessful, surgery to remove the clot may be suggested. This procedure is known as an embolectomy and can be conducted in two ways: 2 5 Surgical embolectomy, where an incision is made into the pulmonary artery and the blood clot is surgically removed. Catheter embolectomy, where a catheter is threaded into the blood vessel via a small incision in the skin. Attempts to break up and remove the clot can then be made by using instruments or suction pads attached to the end of the catheter.",
    "preventing_pulmonary_embolism": "A pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition and therefore, preventive measures are often recommended to people who are believed to be at higher risk of developing the condition. Certain medications and lifestyle changes can be beneficial in helping to prevent pulmonary embolisms. The precise measures suggested by a doctor will depend on the person themselves, their specific risk factors and overall health of the person. 1\n\nPeople who are at risk of developing blood clots, or deep vein thrombosis, may need to take blood thinning medications, known as anticoagulants. An oral anticoagulant called warfarin, also known as coumadin, is often prescribed for this purpose as it can reduce the likelihood of blood clots from forming. 1 The use of medication as a preventive measure against any health condition is called prophylactic treatment. As the majority of pulmonary embolisms occur in ill people, it is particularly common for anticoagulant prophylaxis to be recommended within the following groups: 1 17 Hospitalized people who are at high risk of developing pulmonary embolisms, e.g. those with reduced mobility or who have had blood clots in the past Hospitalized patients who have recently undergone major surgery, particularly surgery to the legs People suffering from cancer People with certain medical conditions, such as blood clotting disorders\n\nIf medication is not an option or has been unsuccessful, a filter may be placed inside the large vein that carries blood from the lower body to the heart as treatment for a pulmonary embolism. This is known as an inferior vena cava filter. An inferior vena cava filter works by trapping any blood clots that have formed in the lower body and are circulating through the bloodstream, thereby preventing them from reaching the lungs and potentially causing a pulmonary embolism. Blood can continue to flow freely through the filter. Good to know: Use of IVC filters is not routine, but they can be used to both prevent and treat pulmonary embolisms in people who cannot take anticoagulation medication, who have developed pulmonary embolisms despite of the use of anticoagulants, or those who have experienced complications of an anticoagulant. 11 17\n\nA number of lifestyle measures can also be used to help prevent the likelihood of a blood clot forming. These include: 1 4 5 17 Physical activity. Getting up and moving around, particularly in people who are prone to clotting. Even light activities, such as sitting, standing and walking can be beneficial. Compression socks. Wearing elastic compression socks can help aid blood circulation by placing light pressure on the blood vessels in the legs. Air compression devices. An inflatable cuff that wraps around the leg or foot can also place external pressure on the blood vessels and aid circulation. Stopping smoking, because smoking increases the risk of developing blood clots.",
    "complications": "With swift diagnosis and treatment of a pulmonary embolism, most people make a full recovery. However, a severe pulmonary embolism can cause significant complications, particularly to the lungs and heart. Potential complications of a pulmonary embolism include: 2 9 11 Cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating and pumping blood around the body Heart attack , where the blood supply to the heart muscle becomes blocked, often by a blood clot Heart failure , where the heart cannot pump blood around the body effectively Obstructive and cardiogenic shock, both of which occur when the heart cannot pump sufficient oxygenated blood around the body Lung infarction, also known as pulmonary infarction, where part of the lung dies due to blocked blood supply Pneumonia , an infection in the lungs, which can arise following lung infarction Atelectasis, where the air sacs in the lung, also known as alveoli, collapse and cannot expand properly. This is, however, very commonly reversible once the blockage is removed and the person is breathing normally again Lung effusion, also known as a pleural effusion, is a buildup of fluid around the lungs Pulmonary hypertension, high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries Irregular heartbeat, also known as a heart arrhythmia Hypoxemia, low levels of oxygen in the bloodstream Once a pulmonary embolism has occurred, there is a high rate of recurrence if preventive measures are not taken. Without anticoagulation treatment, it is believed that the recurrence rate is 10 percent the year after the initial pulmonary embolism and 5 percent per year after. 2 Good to know: Prompt diagnosis and treatment is very important in cases of pulmonary embolism, as it can cause a number of serious health complications and even result in death. It can also make other existing health conditions, such as heart failure , worse. Always contact a doctor immediately if a pulmonary embolism is suspected.",

    "pulmonary_embolism_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between a pulmonary embolism and a deep vein thrombosis? A: A pulmonary embolism is when a blockage occurs in the pulmonary arteries, the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. Often, the blockage is caused by a blood clot that has formed elsewhere in the body and then traveled through the bloodstream to the lungs. A serious blockage can be life-threatening if not treated quickly. A deep vein thrombosis is when a blood clot forms in one of the deep veins of the legs or pelvis. This can lead to swelling and discomfort in the legs. However, if the blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream and reaches the lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism. Deep vein thromboses are the most common cause of pulmonary embolisms. 4 Q: Can a pulmonary embolism occur during pregnancy? A: Yes. Pregnant people are around 10 times more likely to develop a blood clot than non-pregnant people. 19 However, the overall prevalence of blood clots in pregnancy is still low, only occurring in approximately 1 in every 1,600 pregnancies. 20 If a pulmonary embolism is suspected during pregnancy, the preferred diagnostic method is usually a pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan), where a contrast dye is injected into the bloodstream, and the lungs are scanned to visualize any blockages. 19 Q: How is pulmonary embolism treated during pregnancy? A: The blood-thinning drug, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is typically used to treat pulmonary embolism in pregnancy. This is generally administered as an injection, and treatment may continue for at least six weeks after birth. LMWH is a commonly used anticoagulant and is considered safe to use during pregnancy. 19 Q: What is a saddle pulmonary embolism? A: A saddle pulmonary embolism is a large clot that lodges in the pulmonary trunk, the main blood vessel that carries blood out of the heart to the lungs. This large clot straddles the area where the pulmonary trunk splits into the right and left pulmonary arteries. A pulmonary embolism typically only occurs in one pulmonary artery at a time. However, in a saddle pulmonary embolism, the blockage can extend into both pulmonary arteries and is known as a bilateral pulmonary embolism. Saddle pulmonary embolisms are rare and are usually medium to high-risk. 7 21 22"

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/reactive-arthritis/",
    "what_is_reactive_arthritis": "Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a rare inflammatory disease of the joints that occurs in reaction to an infection occurring in another part of the body. It sometimes is referred to as Reiter’s syndrome, Reiter’s disease, or Reiter’s arthritis. However, these terms only describe a small group of people living with ReA. The condition tends to occur in young adults and more frequently in men than women. Read more about arthritis The initial infection is caused by certain groups of bacteria infecting the gastrointestinal or urinary system . After an interval that could last for days to weeks (typically), the arthritis occurs. In most cases, it only affects one or a few joints of the legs. The diagnosis depends on the typical symptoms, clinical findings, course of disease, and the exclusion of other causes for arthritis. Initial treatment consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). ReA can vary in severity and normally occurs as an isolated illness with no further problems and a good prognosis. However, some people may experience persistent symptoms. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 If you think that you might have reactive arthritis, you can try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Reactive arthritis (ReA) is an inflammatory disease of the joints that occurs in reaction to an infection occurring in another part of the body. Typically, reactive arthritis is triggered either by bacteria causing a urinary tract infection or an STD, such as chlamydia , or by bacteria causing gastroenteritis , which is also known as food poisoning – such as campylobacter . The triggering infection may have been so mild that it went unnoticed. ReA is not an infection of the joints, and the severity of the initial infection is not related to the severity of the ensuing arthritis. It is not known why exactly these symptoms develop outside the areas of the body that were or are still infected. Reactive arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, in which the body produces antibodies attacking healthy tissue that causes inflammation. 3 , 6 , 4 Risk factors Reactive arthritis (ReA) is always brought on by an infection elsewhere in the body. The most common infections to trigger reactive arthritis are: 3 , 5 Urethritis an infection of the urethra, the tube which passes urine from the bladder often caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI) , most commonly chlamydia . Gastroenteritis infection of the gut, commonly from food poisoning certain groups of bacteria, such as shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, and yersinia Chlamydia pneumoniae bacteria – which can cause a lung infection Other infections including Group A streptococci, acute tuberculosis , and some viral infections. It is not known exactly what predisposes a person to develop ReA in response to infection. Certain factors that are more common in people with the condition include being: 1, 3, 5, 6 aged roughly 20 to 40 years old male a carrier of the HLA-B27 gene HIV positive.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms of reactive arthritis (ReA) usually begin two to four weeks after the previous infection. They can range from mild to severe, often appear suddenly and tend to last for several months – fluctuating in severity during that time. Signs and symptoms normally stop within about six months. They can be separated in different groups and include: 1 , 2 , 3 Musculoskeletal symptoms: Arthritis: acute-onset only one or a few joints asymmetric often lower extremities, particularly the knees Enthesitis: an inflammation of the site where bone connects to ligaments, tendons, or other connective tissue pain, swelling, and local tenderness most commonly affecting the back of the heel or sole of the foot Dactylitis: swelling of the fingers – which look like sausages Low back pain Additional symptoms include: itchy, red eyes, known as conjunctivitis painful urination caused by a urinary tract infection genital discharge caused by a sexually transmitted disease diarrhea caused by gastroenteritis painless mouth ulcers scaly rash on the palms or soles of feet nail changes sore rash on end of the penis known as balanitis possibly weight loss and fever However, none of the symptoms above are specific to reactive arthritis. The combination of painful urination, conjunctivitis, and arthritis is sometimes called Reiter's syndrome. Only one out of three people living with reactive arthritis show all of these signs. 1 If you think that you might have reactive arthritis, you can try using Ada to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_is_the_diagnosis": "Diagnosis is generally done after a referral is made to a rheumatologist, which is a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or fibrous tissue. Unlike other types of arthritis, there is no specific test which can diagnose reactive arthritis. Instead, a rheumatologist must gather information to rule out other conditions and hone in on the cause of a patient’s symptoms. 1 , 3 , 7 The three cornerstones of diagnosis are: 3 typical musculoskeletal symptoms (see above)* history of urethritis or diarrhea previous to arthritis (May not have been noticed. Only in every second person with ReA the underlying germ can be identified. This is therefore not required for making a diagnosis.) other infections are possible as well, although less commonexclusion of other forms of arthritis crucial for diagnosis. In order to achieve this, the doctor will obtain the following information: 3 , 8 , 9 , 4 , 10 Interview any recent or ongoing infections? any joint pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms ? where? for how long? etc. Physical exam any swollen joints, swollen fingers and toes, and/or tender areas? any skin or eye inflammation? any symptoms of sexually transmitted infection? (see above) laboratory tests Routine laboratory blood test to analyze the person’s blood for signs of acute inflammation or certain systemic conditions. This includes: complete blood count acute phase reactants (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate), C-reactive protein (CRP)) renal and liver function HLA-B27 testing as people who carry this gene are more likely to develop reactive arthritis. This gene can be detected with a blood test. However, only 30 to 50 percent of people with ReA have it, and it is not specific to ReA. Serologic testing for rheumatoid arthritis Analyzing the person’s blood for rheumatoid factor \"Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody\". This is only obtained in people with arthritis in multiple joints. These antibodies are usually absent in people with ReA. Arthrocentesis drawing fluid from an affected joint with a needle performed if the joint is swollen detects if joint is infected by analyzing white blood cell count and identifying bacteria can rule out septic arthritis Tool cultures analyzing the person’s stool for certain groups of bacteria performed if the person has diarrhea Urine sample a) analyzing the person’s urine for signs of a urinary tract infection b) analyzing the person’s first portion of the urine specimen. This is performed if: an infection of Chlamydia trachomatis is suspected The person doesn’t report diarrhea or symptoms typical of urinary tract infection or STD. Vaginal swab will be performed if: an infection of Chlam ydia trachomatis is suspected The woman doesn’t report diarrhea or symptoms typical of urinary tract infection or STD. Medical imaging x-rays of affected joints and entheses (connection between bone and soft tissue) performed to detect changes in the joint can be necessary in order to rule out other causes of joint pain, such as certain forms of arthritis and stress fractures",
    "what_is_the_best_treatment_for_reactive_arthritis": "The treatment of reactive arthritis can vary depending on the underlying infection that triggered the condition in the first place. Also, the treatment can differ depending on the symptoms present and on how the affected person reacts to the initial medication. 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 Treatment generally covers these three areas: 3 treatment of the infection treatment of arthritis treatment of other symptoms. Treatment of the infection: 3 , 5 For some people with ReA, it is necessary to take antibiotics to treat the underlying infection that triggered the condition. This may apply if: There is an ongoing urinary tract infection or STD (particularly if it’s caused by chlamydia) There is an ongoing gastroenteritis that is caused by certain groups of bacteria It affects an old person It affects a person with a weakened immune system. This does not apply if the underlying gastroenteritis has passed is mild is caused by a virus. It is generally not recommended to take any antibiotics if there is no clear reason to do so. Treatment of arthritis: The treatment of the arthritis itself aims at reducing inflammation and suppressing the body’s autoimmune reaction. Two stages can be distinguished: 1 , 3 , 5 a) treating an acute ReAb) treating a chronic ReA lasting six months or longer not reacting to previous treatment efforts. a) treating an acute ReA: Fortunately, in most cases reactive arthritis will resolve by itself and does not result in any joint destruction. Therefore, the treatment goal is to relieve the symptoms.Initial treatment consists of: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Diclofenac (Blood count, as well as liver and kidney function, should be checked before and during treatment). Glucocorticoids (which are either administered as a tablet or directly into the affected joint) This is only required in people who did not react to NSAIDs. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (These reduce inflammation and prevent any destruction to the joint. This is only required in people who did not react to NSAIDs and Glucocorticoids. b) treating a chronic ReA If the ReA lasts six months or longer and has not reacted to previous treatment, it is considered to be chronic. A specialist will advise on how to proceed. 3) Treatment of other symptoms: 3 , 5 People with ReA who show symptoms affecting their eyes, mouth, or skin may require further treatment. In these cases, a specialist should be consulted who will assess the severity and necessity for treatment.",
    "can_reactive_arthritis_be_prevented": "This depends on the underlying infection that triggered the reactive arthritis. If it’s a urinary tract infection or STD caused by chlamydia, antibiotic treatment of the acute infection can prevent ReA from developing.There is no evidence suggesting that ReA resulting from gastroenteritis or chronic ReA can be prevented by antibiotic treatment. 5",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_reactive_arthritis": "The course of disease can differ from person to person. In about half of all people with ReA, the symptoms will resolve within six months. However, in some people, the condition may persist and become chronic. 3 , 4 For people who have the HLA-B27 gene, recurrence may occur.  ref1",

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury/",
    "what_is_repetitive_strain_injury": "Repetitive strain injury, also known as RSI and repetitive motion disorder, is a term for damage to tissues caused by repeated physical actions. These actions are often work-related, such as typing or performing manual labor. The tissues affected are often in the upper body. There are a number of conditions that can be classed as repetitive strain injuries, including: 1 2 Carpal tunnel syndrome, which affects the median nerve in the wrist Tendonitis in the wrist and hand Tendinosis Tenosynovitis, which affects the membrane surrounding a tendon Bursitis in the wrist, knee, elbow or shoulder Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis Cubital tunnel syndrome, which affects the ulnar nerve in the elbow Ulnar tunnel syndrome , also known as Guyon canal syndrome, which affects the wrist Trigger finger or trigger thumb, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis Iliotibial band syndrome\n\nPeople with these conditions experience symptoms ranging from a gentle ache to sharp pain in the affected area or limb that limits their ability to work and perform everyday actions. Repetitive strain injuries usually affect people of working age. Because of the range of conditions and injuries involved, it is difficult to know exactly how many are affected by the condition. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that carpal tunnel syndrome affects around 1.9 million people in the United States. With appropriate treatment, repetitive strain injuries will recover over a period of several months, depending on their severity. Some injuries, particularly those which cannot be alleviated by changes at work, may persist. 2\n\nRead more about sprains of ligaments and tendons.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of repetitive strain injury in the affected limb can include: 2 3 4 5 Tingling Tightness Weakness Swelling Throbbing Loss of sensation Tenderness Burning sensation Numbness Cramping Ache Sharp pain Shooting pain Difficulty moving certain fingers, especially the thumb or index finger Clumsiness Body parts commonly affected by repetitive strain injuries include: Hands Wrists Arm Neck Shoulder Back Knee",
    "causes": "The common factor in all types of repetitive strain injuries is repetitive movements causing injury to body parts. The tissues in these body parts, usually limbs in the upper body, gradually become worn and damaged with overuse. Repeated stresses and strains cause small tears and signs of degeneration which, over time, create symptoms in the person with the condition. Repetitive strain injuries can be caused by: 3 Small, frequent movements Vigorous movements containing a lot of force A lack of movement, such as holding a limb in an unnatural position Examples of activities that can cause repetitive strain injuries are: 3 Using a jackhammer or other vibrating power tool Bending the neck to hold a phone handset Holding tools with small/narrow handles, such as sewing needles or knives Holding tools that are too large Stretching and twisting, such as when painting or cleaning Lifting heavy loads, such as boxes or building materials Gripping a steering wheel Performing the same action repeatedly, such as scanning items at a checkout Holding limbs without support, such as typing with no wrist support Sitting in a cramped position for extended periods of time Some of these activities can also cause pain in other parts of the body, such as the back. Read more about pain the lower back »",
    "types": "Repetitive strain injuries are divided into two categories: Type 1 and Type 2 RSI. Type 1 RSI is where the symptoms can be categorized as a specific condition, such as carpal tunnel syndrome or tennis elbow. Type 2 RSI, or diffuse RSI, is where the symptoms are not easily recognized as a specific condition. Symptoms may be vague or shifting, with few or no visible or measurable signs, such as swelling or nerve damage. 2 6 Some of the Type 1 RSI conditions are listed below.\n\nThe carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligament and bone. The median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the hand, passes through the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused when the median nerve becomes compressed or squeezed. If the carpal tunnel or the surrounding tendons swell, it can compress the median nerve. Numbness and pain in the hand can result. 7 4 Repetitive strain injury is one possible cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Repeated hand and wrist movements can irritate the wrist tendons. Read more about Carpal Tunnel Syndrome »\n\nTendinopathy describes when tendons, which connect muscles to bone or other body parts, become injured. There are two types of tendinopathy: 8 Tendonitis, which is when the tendon becomes inflamed. This can be caused by a sudden injury or by overuse Tendinosis, which is when the tendon does not become inflamed. Tendinosis is typically due to a buildup of small injuries that fail to heal. This is usually caused by overuse Tendonitis or tendinosis can be considered a repetitive strain injury when overuse is the cause. There are tendons all over the body and all are capable of developing tendinopathy. Areas of the body that are commonly associated with tendinopathy include: Heel Wrist Elbow Thumb Read more about Tendonitis »\n\nTendons are surrounded by a protective sheath called the synovium. This sheath may become inflamed, resulting in a condition called tenosynovitis. 9 Tenosynovitis can be caused by injury, infection and/or overuse. When tenosynovitis is caused by overuse and strain, it can be considered an RSI. Any tendon sheath may be affected, but tenosynovitis commonly affects tendons in the: Ankles Feet Wrists Hands\n\nStenosing tenosynovitis, commonly called trigger finger or trigger thumb, occurs when the sheath surrounding tendons in the fingers become damaged. There are bits of fibrous tissue that function as pulleys along the tendon sheaths that help fingers to bend. Stenosing tenosynovitis occurs if the pulley at the base of the finger (known as the A1 pulley) becomes inflamed or thicker than normal. 10 11 Symptoms of stenosing tenosynovitis include: Pain when moving the finger A popping or catching feeling when moving the finger A lump at the base of the finger Affected finger becoming locked in a bent position Stenosing tenosynovitis can be caused by various conditions, such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis , but can also be caused by repeated gripping actions. Where the condition is caused by overuse, it can be considered a repetitive strain injury.\n\nOne of the most common forms of tenosynovitis is De Quervain’s tenosynovitis, sometimes known as gamer’s thumb. This is when the tendons around the base of the thumb and/or the synovium become swollen. De Quervain’s causes pain on the thumb side of the wrist, which gets worse with any gripping or grasping motion. The swelling may be visible. A diagnostic process known as Finkelstein’s test can help diagnose this type of tenosynovitis. This involves placing the affected thumb into the palm of the same hand and making a fist around it. Once the hand is in this position then the wrist should be bent towards the little finger, as if the person is pouring a jug of water. If this increases the pain, then it is likely the person has De Quervain’s tenosynovitis.\n\nBursitis is a form of repetitive strain injury that can affect the knee, elbow, wrist or shoulder. When bursitis affects the shoulder, it can also be referred to as a rotator cuff injury. 12 When the condition affects the area in front of the kneecap, it is sometimes known as housemaid’s knee. 13 A bursa is a small sac filled with fluid that cushions bone and muscles, tendons or skin. Bursitis occurs when a bursa becomes inflamed. The affected area can become swollen and painful. 14 15 Prolonged and repeated movement and pressure on the joint can cause bursitis. These movements can include: Kneeling Using picks and shovels Raising arms Leaning on elbows\n\nTennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is a form of tendinosis that affects the tendons attached to the outside of the elbow. Overuse or trauma can result in degeneration of the tendon’s attachment, which causes pain. Activities that can lead to overuse include: 16 17 Repetitive gripping, such as cutting meat, painting or using a screwdriver Playing racket sports, such as tennis In most people, it affects the dominant arm. If the pain is felt on the inside of the elbow, it is known as medial epicondylitis or Golfer’s elbow. 8\n\nCubital tunnel syndrome is a form of repetitive strain injury where the ulnar nerve, which travels from the neck to the hand, becomes compressed or irritated at the elbow. Numbness and tingling in the hand and fingers, particularly in the ring and little fingers, can result. 4 Repeatedly stretching or bending the elbow, or keeping the elbow bent for long periods of time, can cause the ulnar nerve to become compressed. People who regularly sleep on their elbow, for example, are more likely to be affected by cubital tunnel syndrome.\n\nUlnar tunnel syndrome, also known as Guyon’s canal syndrome, is a form of repetitive strain injury where the ulnar nerve becomes compressed at the wrist. The ulnar tunnel, or Guyon’s canal, is a canal in the wrist which the ulnar nerve passes through. If the ulnar nerve is compressed at the wrist, numbness and tingling in the  ring and little fingers can result. 18 19 Ulnar tunnel syndrome is less common than cubital tunnel syndrome. It is most often caused by a benign cyst, but can also be caused by repetitive movement or pressure to the hand. Activities that can cause such pressure include: Gripping a bicycle handlebar Using a jackhammer or other vibrating power tool Typing",
    "iliotibial_band_syndrom": "Iliotibial band syndrome is another injury that can happen to the knees as results of overuse of the connective tissues on the outer side of the knee. This condition usually affects long-distance runners or cyclists. Poor mechanical balance in the back, hips, and knees increases the risk of developing this condition. The injury can become disabling and may come with following symptoms: sharp pain on the outside of the knee, which may spread up or down the leg, and occasionally up towards your hip. knee swelling, knee tenderness.",
    "diagnosing_repetitive_strain_injury": "There is no specific test to diagnose repetitive strain injury as the condition takes many forms. A complicating factor is that some conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, can have several causes. Repetitive strain injuries are diagnosed by taking a medical history and performing a physical examination. Symptoms may be the result of other conditions, and diagnostic tests may be ordered, such as: 2 4 Blood tests , to check for diabetes or inflammatory joint disease X-rays, to check for arthritis or fractures Other tests can investigate damaged tissues, and include: 2 20 Nerve conduction studies (NCS). This test checks the function of nerves by applying small electrical currents and recording how well the nerve conducts electricity. The test causes a mild tingling and is not painful. Electromyography, also known as Needle EMG. This test checks the function of muscles by inserting small needles into them to measure electrical signals. There may be a small amount of pain or discomfort during this test. Scans. Medical imaging can reveal whether a person’s condition requires surgical treatment.",
    "treatment_for_repetitive_strain_injury": "Treatment for repetitive strain injuries generally follow the same guidelines, whatever the cause or location of the injury. There is some debate about which treatments are effective, but none are actively harmful.\n\nStopping the activity that has caused the repetitive strain injury gives the body tissue time to heal itself. If this is not possible, for example where the activity is part of a job, discussions should be held with the employer about changing work patterns or modifying equipment.\n\nPainkillers can be helpful in the short term for repetitive strain injuries. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help manage pain. NSAIDs are available over the counter or can be prescribed by a medical professional, but carry risks when used in the long term. NSAIDs may be helpful for bursitis, which is caused by inflammation of a bursa. 12 There is some evidence that other painkillers, such as paracetamol, can also be helpful in managing pain. 2\n\nCorticosteroid injections into the site of the repetitive strain injury can provide short-term pain relief. Injections are administered by a medical professional and can provide relief for up to 48 hours. Steroid injections have few side effects, but may briefly worsen the pain. They work by directly reducing inflammation at the site of the injury. Steroids should not be taken for long periods of time as they can damage tissues and lead to other complications, such as cushing’s syndrome . Corticosteroid injections may be helpful for carpal tunnel syndrome, bursitis and tennis elbow. 4 14 21\n\nWearing a brace or splint can prevent further pressure on the affected body part and allow it time to heal. A brace may be helpful for repetitive strain injuries such as: 4 18 Cubital tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Ulnar tunnel syndrome\n\nSurgery is an option for repetitive strain injuries which do not respond to non-surgical treatment or cause particular pain and disruption. Surgery may be helpful for severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow and cubital tunnel syndrome. Surgery for tennis elbow removes the damaged part of the tendon. 21 For cubital tunnel surgery, the roof of the tunnel may be opened or widened,  or the nerve may be moved to a new position at the front of the elbow. 22\n\nCarpal tunnel release surgery is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States, with between 300,000 and 500,000 surgeries performed each year. Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome is performed as a day procedure under local anesthesia. The ligament that forms the top of the carpal tunnel is cut, creating more space for the nerve and releasing pressure. Symptoms should disappear over time, though severe cases may not be completely cured. 4 Read more about the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome\n\nTherapy to strengthen and improve mobility in body tissues may be helpful for repetitive strain injuries such as tennis elbow and bursitis. A physiotherapist can identify the best exercises for a particular injury and demonstrate how to perform each exercise so as to minimize the risk of further damage. 12 21 Physiotherapy will also be recommended after any surgery.\n\nCooling the affected area with ice is a common home remedy for repetitive strain injuries. Ice can numb the skin and provide short-term pain relief. 14 However, evidence to show whether using ice is helpful for long-term tissue repair is lacking. 23",
    "preventing_repetitive_strain_injury": "Repetitive movements are the main cause of repetitive strain injuries, so taking steps to prevent the injury or stopping it getting worse is important. Many repetitive strain injuries happen at work, and workplaces should be equipped to do an ergonomic assessment of the work environment. Ergonomics is the study of how people interact with objects and their surroundings in the safest way. Preventative measures that may be recommended include: 24 25 Using wrist rests or adjusting a computer keyboard for typing Adjusting a chair and desk, so feet rest flat on the floor Using an appropriate chair, if sitting for long periods of time Taking breaks from repetitive tasks Using padding or gloves to reduce the effects of vibration from power tools Using a headset for prolonged telephone use Maintaining good posture Avoiding standing or sitting in one position for long periods of time Using less force when carrying out tasks The U.S.’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has a step-by-step guide to evaluating and addressing workplaces for ergonomic best practices. Repetitive strain injuries can also be caused by playing sport or taking part in hobbies. Preventative measures can include: Doing warm up exercises before playing sport Changing equipment, such as a tennis racket with a properly fitted grip and flexible strings Improving or changing technique Being aware of ergonomic factors in the home and with hobbies Taking regular breaks from repetitive movements during activities such as knitting or woodworking",
    "repetitive_strain_injury_faqs": "Q: Can I get compensation for repetitive strain injury? A: Repetitive strain injuries are often caused by poor practices in the workplace. Whether your workplace is liable to pay compensation will depend on the laws of the country you are working in. In the U.S., the extent of the injury, how severely it affects your activities, and whether the employer took steps to prevent the injury are taken into account. Q: Is repetitive strain injury permanent? A: Repetitive strain injury can be cured with appropriate treatment, which may range from rest to surgery. Some severe cases may not be entirely cured. Effective treatment should be complemented by changing the activity that caused the injury. See Treatment for repetitive strain injury above. Q: Which types of repetitive strain injury affect the wrist? A: Of the types of repetitive strain injury mentioned in this resource, the ones that can affect the wrist are: Carpal tunnel syndrome, which affects the median nerve in the wrist Tendonitis or tendinosis Tenosynovitis Bursitis Ulnar tunnel syndrome Type 2 or diffuse RSI, where the injury cannot be classified into a specific syndrome, can also affect the wrist. Q: Which types of repetitive strain injury affect the thumb? A: Of the types of repetitive strain injury mentioned in this resource, the ones that can affect the thumb include: Trigger thumb, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis De Quervain’s tenosynovitis Tendonitis or tendinosis Type 2 or diffuse RSI, where the injury cannot be classified into a specific syndrome, can also affect the thumb. Q: Which types of repetitive strain injury affect the shoulder? A: Of the types of repetitive strain injury mentioned in this resource, the ones that can affect the shoulder are: Bursitis, sometimes known as a rotator cuff injury when the shoulder is affected Tendonitis or tendinosis Tenosynovitis Type 2 or diffuse RSI, where the injury cannot be classified into a specific syndrome, can also affect the shoulder.

A: Of the types of repetitive strain injury mentioned in this resource, the ones that can affect the elbow are: Tennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis Golfer’s elbow, also known as medial epicondylitis Bursitis Tendonitis or tendinosis Tenosynovitis Type 2 or diffuse RSI, where the injury cannot be classified into a specific syndrome, can also affect the elbow. Q: Which types of repetitive strain injury affect the forearm? A: Of the types of repetitive strain injury mentioned in this resource, the ones that can affect the forearm are: Carpal tunnel syndrome Cubital tunnel syndrome Bursitis Tendonitis or tendinosis Tenosynovitis Pain from De Quervain’s tenosynovitis can sometimes travel up the forearm, even if the injury only affects the base of the thumb. Type 2 or diffuse RSI, where the injury cannot be classified into a specific syndrome, can also affect the forearm. Q: Can repetitive strain injury cause arthritis? A: Arthritis is the name for a number of conditions in which a person’s joints, the connections between the bones in their body, become inflamed. A repetitive strain injury is a term describing damage to tissue, such as tendons and muscles, through overuse. While the tissue damage itself cannot cause arthritis, the reasons behind the RSI, e.g. certain work environments that place specific stresses upon the body, may make it more likely that a person develops arthritis.

    "condition": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/restless-legs-syndrome/",
    "what_is_restless_legs_syndrome": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) , also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a chronic condition that causes strong, unpleasant feelings in the legs, resulting in an overwhelming need to move them. Moving the legs relieves the unpleasant sensations. 1 2 RLS is considered a condition of the nervous system, sometimes referred to as a neurological disorder. Because RLS can seriously affect some people’s sleep patterns, it can also be classed as a sleep disorder. 3\n\nAround eight percent of the population of the U.S. 4 is thought to be affected by RLS. Symptoms often begin at around 40 to 45 years of age, more often affecting women than men. This is known as late-onset restless legs syndrome. Early-onset restless legs syndrome is when the condition appears before the age of 45, with symptoms rarely starting as early as during childhood. Early-onset restless legs syndrome appears to be more likely to run in families than the late-onset version of the condition. People affected by other conditions, such as iron deficiency anemia 1 or Parkinson’s disease 5 may also show symptoms of restless legs syndrome. These symptoms can also sometimes appear during pregnancy. Restless legs syndrome cannot be cured. However, various treatments, including home remedies, lifestyle changes, and natural treatments, can lessen the severity of symptoms. If RLS is triggered by a specific condition or medication, treating that condition can eliminate RLS.",
    "symptoms_what_does_restless_leg_syndrome_feel_like": "The main symptom of RLS is an overwhelming urge to move the legs because of uncomfortable and unpleasant feelings in one or both legs. The sensations in the legs and, in severe cases, the arms are variously described as: 1 7 8 Crawling Itching Aching Throbbing Pulling Burning Painful Fizzing Tickling Tingling Feeling the urge to move Cramping Restlessness Creeping Causing discomfort Tenseness Having an electric current Some people may experience the feelings as painful, but most people feel the sensations as an ache rather than a sharp or sudden pain.\n\nSymptoms occur when the person is at rest or inactive, such as: 4 7 Lying down Sitting In bed In a restricted space, like on a plane or at the movies As a person is more likely to be at rest in the afternoon and evening, those are the parts of the day when RLS symptoms are usually at their worst. For some of those affected by RLS, the symptoms may only occur occasionally, while for others they are present every day. Symptoms tend to improve in the mornings with getting up, and whenever the person starts to move or walk around. 1 Moving around as a remedy can cause problems when the person is trying to go to sleep. Symptoms can vary in severity, from mild discomfort to being so disruptive and painful they affect day-to-day life. Sleep can be so disturbed that people have difficulty functioning during the day, which can commonly lead to depression and anxiety. 1 9 8\n\nPeriodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS), also known as periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) 2 , is experienced by about 80 percent of people with restless legs syndrome. 10 Periodic limb movement in sleep causes limbs, commonly the legs but also sometimes the arms, to jerk or twitch involuntarily during sleep. It can be so severe as to wake the sleeper and disturb anyone sharing the bed. Involuntary limb movements may also occur during waking hours, when it is known as periodic limb movement during awakening (PLMW or PLMA). 10 Most people with restless legs syndrome have PLMS, but many people with PLMS do not also have restless legs syndrome.",
    "what_causes_restless_leg_syndrome": "In most cases, it is not known what causes restless legs syndrome . This is called primary, or idiopathic, RLS. Sometimes restless legs syndrome is caused by another health condition. This is known as secondary RLS.\n\nPrimary restless legs syndrome tends to begin slowly, around the age of 40. This is earlier than most secondary RLS cases. RLS also runs in families, suggesting a genetic link. 9 There is research that suggests restless legs syndrome may be connected to problems with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia, which uses dopamine to control muscle movement. If transmission of dopamine signals in this part of the brain becomes impaired, it can result in muscle spasms and jerky movements. 1\n\nThere are a number of factors that appear to be linked to restless legs syndrome. These may include:\n\nA lack of iron in the body, leading to iron deficiency anemia 12 , appears to be linked to restless legs syndrome. 13 Iron plays a role in the functioning of  dopamine and other neurotransmitters’ function in the brain. Read more about iron deficiency anemia »\n\nPregnant women may develop restless legs syndrome , with symptoms more common in the final trimester. Between 10 percent and 25 percent of pregnant women are thought to experience symptoms. 14 Nobody is quite sure why pregnancy can trigger restless legs syndrome. There are suggestions it may be connected to: 14 Low iron levels Low folate levels Circulation problems Increase in estrogen Restless legs syndrome that develops during pregnancy very often goes away within a month after birth. 1\n\nThere are several conditions that can lead to restless legs syndrome as a complication, or have been linked to it, sometimes without yet fully understanding the mechanisms behind the link, such as: 8 End-stage kidney disease, particularly when needing dialysis Nerve damage. This includes peripheral neuropathy, which may itself be a complication caused by diabetes Spinal cord disease Multiple sclerosis Fibromyalgia Parkinson’s disease Rheumatoid arthritis\n\nMany medications and other substances can make restless legs syndrome worse, or rarer even cause it, these include such as: Certain antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Metoclopramide, an anti-nausea medication Certain antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol and phenothiazines Lithium is used to treat bipolar disorder or sometimes for severe depression Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, found in cold and allergy medications Calcium channel blockers, used to treat high blood pressure Beta-blockers, used to treat blood pressure and heart conditions Caffeine and alcohol Smoking tobacco",
    "diagnosis": "These are the diagnostic criteria for RLS, published by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). All five criteria are required for the diagnosis: 8 An urge to move the legs, usually caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs. Sometimes the urge to move is present without the sensations, and sometimes the arms or other body parts are involved as well as the legs. The urge to move or sensations in the limbs begin or become worse while resting. The urge to move or sensations in the limbs are partially or totally eased by moving. Relief lasts as long as the movement continues. The urge to move or sensations in the limbs are worse in the evening or night or only happen in the evening or night. Symptoms are not explained by another medical or behavioral condition. Check whether this matches your symptoms with the Ada app . A doctor will diagnose based on a description of symptoms and triggers. A physical and/or neurological exam may be done, a family history taken, and possibly blood tests to look for underlying factors or other treatable conditions. A sleep study may be helpful to check for sleep disruption and periodic limb movement in sleep. The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation 4 produces an RLS Symptom Diary 15 which can be printed off and used to track symptoms, activities, and sleep patterns. RLS-UK also has a tool to help affected people monitor symptoms and medication. 16",
    "restless_leg_syndrome_in_children": "There is thought to be a genetic link with restless legs syndrome, especially with primary restless legs syndrome . The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation reports that 35 percent of people with the condition say they first experienced symptoms before the age of 20, and that 1.5 million children and adolescents in the United States are believed to be affected. 17 Children with RLS are likely to be tired during the day, due to disturbed sleep. This can affect their performance in school, social functioning and interactions with peers and family. RLS is usually diagnosed based on a person’s description of their symptoms. However, it can be difficult for children to express what they are experiencing and accurately report their symptom history. Children exhibiting twitching and fidgeting may be mistaken for having ADHD. There is research to suggest 25 percent of children with RLS or periodic limb movements in sleep may be misdiagnosed as having ADHD. 18",
    "treatment": "There is often no cure for  primary restless legs syndrome, though its symptoms can be managed to make the condition easier to live with. If restless legs syndrome is caused by a condition or medication, symptoms may go away and not return if the condition is cured or the causative medication is stopped. For example: RLS caused by pregnancy typically ends within four weeks after giving birth Treating iron deficiency with iron supplements may cause an associated RLS to go away RLS caused or made worse by a medication may be treated by stopping or changing medication, after consultation with a medical professional\n\nWhere restless legs syndrome is thought to be caused by an iron deficiency anemia, a lack of iron and/or ferritin in the body, treatment with iron supplements is advised. A blood test, physical examination, and discussion with a doctor will establish the appropriate amount of iron supplements per day, possibly taken alongside supplements of vitamin C to help absorption. If this does not affect iron levels, less commonly, an intravenous infusion may be necessary. 1 7 Side effects of taking more than 20mg of iron a day can include: 19 Constipation Stomach ache Nausea and vomiting Taking extremely high doses of iron can be dangerous. Although iron supplements are commonly available, treating restless legs syndrome with iron should be supervised by a medical professional.\n\nIf the symptoms of restless legs syndrome are mild, lifestyle changes may be the only treatment needed. In these cases, there are plenty of natural treatments and home remedies that can be tried. 1 20 Adopting good sleep practices can help a person with restless legs syndrome get enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep can be one of the most disruptive consequences of RLS. Good sleep habits can include: Going to bed and waking up at regular times, even on the weekends or days off Not napping during the day Make sure the bedroom is dark, cool, quiet, and comfortable Taking electronic equipment, such as TV and phone, out of the bedroom Changes to diet may also help with reducing symptoms of restless legs syndrome: Avoid stimulants, like caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol, particularly before bed Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration Certain activities can ease restless legs syndrome symptoms, such as: 20 Regular, moderate exercise Avoid being confined in places, for example, choose an aisle seat at the movies or on a plane Massaging the legs Taking a warm bath RLS-UK suggests hot-cold therapy, a shower of alternating hot and cold water Simple leg stretches or getting up and walking a little as often as possible may help in confined spaces like a plane, as well as in daily life when e.g. working a desk job sitting all-day\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved devices to treat restless legs syndrome 1 , including a foot wrap 21 and a vibrating pad. This pad, called Relaxis®, has been found to improve quality of sleep. 22\n\nIn more severe cases of RLS or when other treatments do not improve symptoms sufficiently, a medical professional may recommend medication for the condition.\n\nA class of drugs called dopamine agonists works by mimicking dopamine in the brain to stimulate a response. They are also often used to treat Parkinson’s disease. 23 Multiple types of dopamine agonists have been approved to treat restless legs syndrome, among them: 1 Bromocriptine Ropinirole Pramipexole Rotigotine, taken as a skin patch Side effects of these drugs can include: Nausea Sleepiness Headaches Dizziness Fainting when standing up\n\nLevodopa is a drug that the body converts into dopamine. It is usually taken alongside a drug called carbidopa, which stops levodopa from being converted into dopamine before reaching the brain. 24 25 Sudden drowsiness and falling asleep can be a side effect of taking levodopa. It is advisable not to drive, operate machinery, or take part in potentially dangerous activities until it’s clear how levodopa affects the person taking it. 25 Levodopa is not recommended for long-term use as it can make restless legs syndrome symptoms worse. It’s generally prescribed for occasional, short-term use, e.g. when people feel symptoms coming on.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved gabapentin enacarbil for treating restless legs syndrome. Two other anti-seizure medications, pregabalin and gabapentin, are being trialed, but not currently approved by the FDA for RLS treatment. 7 A long-release form of gabapentin enacarbil is used to treat restless legs syndrome. The medication decreases the uncomfortable, creeping feelings in the legs. 1 26 Possible side effects, which lessen over time, of gabapentin enacarbil include: 26 Fatigue is a strong physical tiredness Feeling dizzy Feeling sleepy Gabapentin enacarbil appears to be as effective or better at treating symptoms of restless legs syndrome as the dopamine agonist pramipexole. It seems to be of particular benefit to people with RLS, who are: 7 8 In pain Experiencing disturbed sleep as the primary symptom Having difficulty with impulse control\n\nOne of the most disruptive effects of restless legs syndrome can be lack of sleep. Medication from the benzodiazepine class of drugs, also known as hypnotics, may be prescribed as a short-term solution to help induce sleep. Benzodiazepines can include: 1 7 Temazepam Clonazepam Lorazepam Zaleplon Eszopiclone These drugs are not recommended for long-term use because of their various side effects, which include: 1 Feeling sleepy during the day Lack of concentration Feeling sluggish Causing or worsening sleep apnea High risk of addiction\n\nThere are complications associated with dopamine medication used for treating restless legs syndrome. Augmentation is the name for symptoms worsening under long-term use of certain medications for restless legs syndrome. People experiencing augmentation often find that symptoms start earlier in the day, start quicker once they rest, and the symptoms become more severe or spread further than previously. 7 Augmentation is more common with long-term levodopa use, seen in possibly up to 80 percent of cases as opposed to longer-term dopamine agonist use, where this is generally seen in less than 30 percent of cases. It tends to occur around six months after starting a particular treatment. 27 Ending the treatment will likely relieve signs of augmentation. However, coming off the drugs may be difficult as withdrawal symptoms can occur. Good to know: To date, gabapentin enacarbil, an alternative to dopamine medication, has not been shown to cause augmentation. 7 Rebound occurs when restless legs syndrome symptoms appear in the morning or late at night and are related to a dose of the drug wearing off. It is differentiated from augmentation by lacking a worsening in severity of symptoms and of symptoms recurring at a different time of day; rebound often occurs in the morning as opposed to during the evening, as seen in augmentation. 27 As with augmentation, rebound can be halted and reversed by stopping taking the medication. Rebound can also be counteracted with longer-acting medication formulations.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any medication for treating restless legs syndrome in children. The long-term effects of treating children with medication approved for adults are unknown. 28 Benzodiazepines, such as clonazepam, are not recommended for children because they can increase the risk of collapse of the upper airway. Up to 20 percent of children taking levodopa and carbidopa develop a side effect of feeling nauseous. 28 Good sleep habits are recommended for treating restless legs syndrome in children, as is avoiding caffeine and antihistamines. Vitamin and mineral supplements may help when taken in consultation with a doctor. 18 28",
    "restless_legs_syndrome_faqs": "Q: Is restless legs syndrome painful? A: Not generally. People tend to describe the sensations caused by restless legs syndrome as uncomfortable, such as feelings of crawling or itching. In severe cases, people may report feeling pain. Q: Does restless legs syndrome get worse with age? A: Primary restless legs syndrome has no cure. Although symptoms may worsen with age, treatment and therapy can bring symptoms under control and minimize disruption to everyday life. 1 Q: What vitamins help restless leg syndrome? A: Sometimes restless legs syndrome is caused by an iron deficiency, in which case iron supplements can ease or reverse symptoms. If a person has a healthy and balanced diet, there is usually no need for supplements. A medical professional can assess whether symptoms of RLS are caused by a vitamin or mineral deficiency and can recommend supplements where necessary. Q: Does magnesium help restless legs syndrome? A: Although some people with restless legs syndrome report that products like magnesium oil spray have been helpful, and others report magnesium supplements helped with insomnia, 29 30 , Harvard Men’s Health Watch notes that studies on magnesium and sleep have, to date, been small and of short duration. 31 A well-grounded scientific basis for using magnesium to help with restless legs syndrome is currently lacking. Q: What essential oils help with restless legs syndrome? A: Although some people report that symptoms are reduced by using essential oils, there is no scientific evidence that they have any effect. Any benefit is likely to be from massaging the legs or the placebo effect. Q: What home remedies and natural treatments work for restless legs syndrome? A: There are some lifestyle changes, such as good sleep hygiene, avoiding stimulants and taking exercise, that can ease symptoms of restless legs syndrome. There are reports that drinking quinine tonic water, or placing a bar of soap under a bed sheet at night, will help; however, there is no scientific evidence for these activities, and any benefit is likely to be the placebo effect. Q: What causes restless legs syndrome? A: Nobody quite knows what causes primary restless legs syndrome. In some cases, restless legs syndrome can appear as a secondary condition, such as when someone is pregnant, has end-stage renal disease, or has an iron deficiency. Q: What’s the best treatment for restless legs syndrome? A: The best way to treat restless legs syndrome will depend on whether a cause can be found and how severe the symptoms are. For example, if  RLS is being caused by an iron deficiency, the treatment will be to take iron supplements. If a person has primary RLS, but symptoms are mild, they may be able to manage them without medication. If symptoms are severe, there are various medications. A doctor can help to find the appropriate treatment. Q: Will my restless legs syndrome develop into Parkinson’s disease? A: Restless legs syndrome will not develop into another neurological disorder, such as Parkinson’s disease. However, there may be serious complications of long-term sleep deprivation, which can include developing depression, anxiety, and a higher risk for diabetes. Q: Can you have restless legs syndrome in your arms? A: Yes. In severe cases of restless legs syndrome, symptoms can affect the arms, face, and trunk of the body. Q: What exercises can I do for restless legs syndrome? A; Regular, moderate exercise has been shown to lower the severity of restless legs syndrome symptoms. Walking and stretching have also shown benefits, particularly a non-strenuous walk in the evening."

The most common rheumatic fever symptoms are: fever joint pain chest pain uncontrollable movements, such as jerking, in the hands, feet and face feeling short of breath fatigue small lumps under the skin Rarely, people with rheumatic fever may get a rash, which appears as pale pink rings. 1 2 3",
    "how_is_rheumatic_fever_diagnosed": "There is no single test for rheumatic fever. A doctor may ask you questions about your health and perform an examination to reach a rheumatic fever diagnosis. Often, a throat swab will be taken to check what bacteria is causing the infection. 1 5 After that, further investigations may be done to see what organs are affected. Common investigations include an echocardiogram or electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for any damage to the heart. It may be necessary to have blood tests done, to confirm if there are signs of infection or inflammation in the body. 1",
    "how_is_rheumatic_fever_treated": "Rheumatic fever treatment focuses on treating the underlying bacterial infection with a course of antibiotics. It is important that these are taken correctly to reduce the chance of the infection returning. 6 It may be necessary to take antibiotics for several years to prevent rheumatic fever coming back. Most people recover within about 3 months, but this can vary depending on the severity. 2 Rheumatic fever symptoms are treated with a variety of medicines. These may include: painkillers to ease chest or joint pain steroid injections medication to prevent uncontrolled movements anti-inflammatory medications If rheumatic fever leads to long term effects, life-long medication may be needed to support heart function. 2",

    "what_is_rheumatoid_arthritis": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term, inflammatory arthritis, which develops gradually and is caused by an autoimmune reaction. This means that the immune system mistakenly forms proteins which are meant to fight infections, known as antibodies, that attack the body tissue instead. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis occur in episodes or flare ups of pain and swelling in the joints, with periods of remission in between. Usually the joints are affected symmetrically, especially the hands, wrists and feet, and many joints may be inflamed. It can also affect other parts of a person’s body, including the lungs, heart and eyes. Onset may include symptoms such as fever and fatigue. The prevalence of RA varies between populations around the world, from 0.1 percent in rural Africans to 5 percent in some Native American groups. Women are affected two to three times more often than men. 1 The age of onset for rheumatoid arthritis is usually over 35, and the likelihood of developing the condition increases as a person gets older. Onset is highest among adults in their 60s. However, the condition can occur at any age from the age of 14, when it may be called early-onset rheumatoid arthritis. 2 Rheumatoid arthritis is normally a lifelong condition that worsens with age. If RA is not treated early, it can cause irreversible damage to joints, leading to disability. However, it can normally be well-managed with medications to slow down the immune system, thereby slowing the progression of the disease, as well as pain medications for relief of symptoms. There is currently no specific cure for rheumatoid arthritis. By definition, rheumatoid arthritis appears in adults and not in children. However, a related condition may sometimes appear in children, which is known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis , previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis . Juvenile idiopathic arthritis may clear up by the time adulthood is reached. Many children with this condition also experience regular fevers.

    "rheumatoid_arthritis_symptoms": "In most people, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms begin very subtly, and it may be many weeks or months before they become troublesome enough to seek medical attention. Early signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: 1 2 Joint stiffness, often in the hands and feet, usually worse in the morning Joint pain and swelling Fatigue Muscle pain Low-grade fever Numbness and tingling in the hands Good to know: Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the small joints first, such as the first two joints of the fingers and the first joints of the toes. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in the hands occur rarely in the distal or outermost joints. RA can also start in one large joint, such as the knee or the shoulder, and may move from one joint to another or disappear for a long time before recurring. Worried that you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? Try the Ada app for a free assessment.",
    "causes": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, which means that it is caused by abnormal functioning of the immune system. In a healthy immune system, the body attacks foreign bacteria and viruses. In the case of autoimmune disease, the body accidentally attacks healthy tissue instead. In rheumatoid arthritis, the body attacks its own joint tissue. Healthy joints are needed to absorb shock and allow for smooth movement between the bones. People with RA produce an excess of white blood cells in the synovial membrane, also known as the synovium, the tissue that lines the cavities of joints, causing inflammation. This can lead to joint erosion, loss of motion and occasionally damage to other associated parts of the body, such as the lungs, heart, blood vessels and eyes. If RA is left untreated, pannus tissue may form, in which there is excess, uneven tissue growth in a joint, which can further erode and damage cartilage and bone.",
    "risk_factors": "It is not certain what causes rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but some possible contributing factors have been identified, including:\n\nSpecific variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are associated with a higher risk of developing RA. These variations make the white blood cells attempt to correct abnormalities in the joints more quickly than usual, which may be what leads to the inflammation and associated tissue damage that results from rheumatoid arthritis. However, rheumatoid arthritis is not an inherited condition; not everyone with RA has a variant HLA system and not everyone with a variant HLA develops RA. Genes do not cause the condition, but affect the risk of it developing. 3 Other non-HLA genes have also been linked to RA. 4\n\nCertain microbial infections are believed to play an important role in triggering and worsening RA. These may include: 5 A gum infection, specifically P. gingivalis A urine infection, specifically P. mirabilis The Epstein-Barr virus, best known as the cause of mononucleosis\n\nResearch has shown that exposure to certain irritants in the air may play a role in a person’s risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, including: 6 7 Tobacco smoke Silica dust, mainly affecting people in the mining industry Certain mineral oils, such as found in hydraulic oil Good to know: Once rheumatoid arthritis has developed, using tobacco products can also increase the severity of rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and interfere with rheumatoid arthritis medication. Using tobacco products, particularly smoking, may also cause a debilitating increase in heart rate and breathing rate, which may lead to a loss of will to exercise, in turn leading to further joint weakening. Tobacco smoking can also increase the risk of complications if surgery is needed for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is far more common in women, who make up about 70 percent of people diagnosed. It is not known exactly why women are more likely to develop the condition, but hormonal factors are thought to play a part. The condition tends to decrease or disappear during pregnancy and people with the condition may experience flare ups in the weeks after giving birth. 8 It has been suggested that this may be due to production of prolactin , the milk production hormone, having an inflammatory effect. 7\n\nPhysical trauma has been linked to rheumatoid arthritis onset, such as with sports injuries. Physical trauma can trigger inflammation, which it is thought may contribute to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, possibly at a much later date. However, it is not known why this might be. Some people may have a predisposition to such inflammation. 9\n\nResearch has found that obesity may have an impact on the development of the condition. 10 11 It is not known why this is, but one reason postulated is that fat cells release proteins called cytokines, which create inflammation throughout the body. 12 Good to know: Obesity may also have a negative impact on the effectiveness of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, particularly with some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 13 It can also lead to earlier deterioration of the main joints, such as the knees, due to increased pressure.",
    "rheumatoid_arthritis_and_covid_19": "People with rheumatoid arthritis are more susceptible to infections, including an infection with the coronavirus. If you have rheumatoid arthritis and COVID-19 , you may be at risk for severe complications , hospitalization, and even death.",
    "diagnosing_rheumatoid_arthritis": "Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is generally confirmed after referral to a rheumatologist, a type of doctor specializing in inflammation and pain in the joints, muscles, or fibrous tissues. RA can take a long time to diagnose as its early onset can be subtle and present similarly to other, less long-term conditions, such as flu, also known as influenza . It also often presents similarly to other types of arthritis, such as reactive arthritis . Unlike other types of arthritis, there is no specific test for rheumatoid arthritis. Instead, a rheumatologist relies on gathering information to rule out other conditions and identify the cause of a person’s symptoms. Diagnosis may be made from a combination of reported medical history and symptoms, a physical examination, laboratory tests and medical imaging. Try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.\n\nIt is important that a person describe any joint pain and other symptoms, as well as how long they have been going on for. A doctor will look for signs of rheumatoid arthritis, such as swollen, tender, warm joints with painful or limited movement, and rheumatoid nodules (see complications ). They may also ask for family medical history; if another member of their family has the disease, then a person has a higher risk of having the condition themselves.\n\nIf a doctor suspects rheumatoid arthritis, one or more blood tests may be done to help make a diagnosis. These include: 14 Testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies: RF is a protein that attacks healthy tissues. If it is present, there is about an 80 percent chance that a person has or may develop rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory disease. Anti-CCP antibodies indicate that a person is very likely to develop RA. Measuring inflammatory markers: Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) C-reactive protein (CRP) Good to know: The presence of anti-CCP antibodies in the blood indicates that a person with RA may be more likely to develop severe symptoms, requiring more intensive treatment. Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nA doctor may also recommend an X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the affected joint. This can help to rule out other conditions that present with similar symptoms, such as gout. However, at an early stage of rheumatoid arthritis, any characteristic damage caused by the condition may not be apparent. 14",
    "treating_rheumatoid_arthritis": "It is very important to start treatment as soon as possible to prevent any permanent joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can usually be effectively managed with early, appropriate treatment. There is currently no rheumatoid arthritis cure, and it is usually a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment. The main aims of treatment for RA are: 15 16 To prevent joint damage To minimize pain and other symptoms, and maintain quality of life To prevent the development of associated conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease There are three main aspects of rheumatoid arthritis treatment: Medication Physical therapy In some cases, surgery\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is usually treated with a combination of medications. The five main types of drugs used for rheumatoid arthritis are: 16 Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate. These work by blocking the effects of chemicals released by the immune system, which can damage nearby bones, tendons, ligaments and cartilage. Biologic agents: Also known as biologic response modifiers, these are a newer class of DMARDs. Biologic DMARDs are most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD. Biologics may be administered intravenously or by injection Steroids: These quickly improve symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness and swelling and are generally recommended where rheumatoid arthritis severely limits a person’s ability to function normally, until slower acting joint damage-preventing DMARDs begin to work. These may be administered by injection to provide targeted pain relief. Painkillers. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen or celecoxib can offer pain relief while also reducing inflammation, though they won’t prevent RA from getting worse over time. Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, and codeine have no effect on inflammation, but may be helpful in relieving pain, for example in the case of a badly damaged joint that cannot be replaced with surgery.\n\nPeople with rheumatoid arthritis often become inactive due to joint pain and stiffness. However, inactivity can lead to inflexibility, muscle and tendon shortening, and muscle weakness. In turn, weakness further increases fatigue and decreases stability of the joints. A physiotherapist can recommend safe exercises to strengthen muscles, restore joint range-of-motion joints and ease symptoms. An occupational therapist may recommend ways to approach day-to-day activities without putting too much strain on the joints. They may also recommend splints if needed for hand and wrist support. A podiatrist may work with a person on ways to ease problems with the feet and ankles, such as by using appropriate footwear. Some people find that yoga helps to relieve symptoms, although currently there is not strong medical evidence to support this. People with RA must do yoga with proper supervision to ensure that it is safe.\n\nOccasionally, surgery is needed to treat joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis. These can be minor surgeries, such as to release a nerve or tendon or more major surgeries such as hip, knee, shoulder and elbow replacements.\n\nThere are no clear-cut answers as to what diet to follow with rheumatoid arthritis, as there is a lot of conflicting evidence, and different diets may affect people in different ways. However, it is generally recommended that a person eat: 17 18 A balanced and varied diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, fish, pulses, nuts and olive oil to get all the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other nutrients you need Omega-3 fatty acid-rich food regularly, such as oily fish, seaweed and walnuts Calcium-rich food, such as dairy products and calcium-enriched non-dairy products Vitamin-D-rich food, such as eggs Iron-rich food, such as dark green vegetables Weight loss may be recommended for overweight people to reduce stress on affected joints. However, sometimes people with rheumatoid arthritis lose their appetite, and dietary therapy may be recommended to help ensure that an adequate amount of calories and nutrients are consumed.\n\nNatural treatments have not conclusively been shown to stop or slow rheumatoid arthritis progression, but certain treatments may help with pain relief when used in conjunction with prescribed rheumatoid arthritis medications, including: Supplements for rheumatoid arthritis containing gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) have been shown to modestly improve joint pain, stiffness and grip strength. 19 This includes evening primrose oil or borage oil, especially when combined with fish oil, which reduces the synthesis of inflammatory by-products of GLA. 20 Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be recommended if not enough is consumed through diet. These can help to minimize bone loss , which is associated with steroid therapy. 16 Some people find that home remedies, such as essential oils and turmeric help to relieve symptoms, although there is currently no strong medical evidence to support these. Good to know: Rheumatoid arthritis should never be treated exclusively with natural supplements or without seeing a doctor.\n\nSome people find it helpful to discuss their condition and treatment in support groups. There are many local support groups which meet up in person, as well as online forums, such as on The Arthritis Foundation or myRAteam .",
    "complications": "As the condition progresses, further signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may develop, such as: 1 21 Rheumatoid arthritis in hands: The swelling associated with rheumatoid arthritis causes some people to develop carpal tunnel syndrome . This is the compression of a nerve running through the wrist, characterized by tingling, numbness and weakness in the hand. Certain permanent bone alterations can also occur with long-term rheumatoid arthritis, such as swan neck deformities, boutonniere deformities, ulnar deviation and the bowstring sign. Rheumatoid arthritis in knee: Inflammation of the knee is associated with difficulty bending the knee, damage to the bones that meet at the knee, and excessive looseness of the supporting ligaments of the knee. This may cause the development of a Baker’s cyst, a cyst which fills with joint fluid in the hollow space at the back of the knee. Rheumatoid arthritis in feet: Pain in the feet may cause a person with rheumatoid arthritis to stand with weight on the heels and the toes bent upwards. The top of the foot may be red and swollen, and the heel may be painful. Rheumatoid arthritis nodules: These are firm lumps which develop under the skin, usually near joints which are inflamed or near pressure points.  Common locations include the underside of the forearm, the elbow, and the fingers and knuckles of the hands. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause inflammation of tissues other than the joints, for example: 1 Rheumatoid arthritis in the lungs: may cause shortness of breath and a dry cough. Rheumatoid arthritis in the cervical spine, the bones of the neck: Although RA normally affects other joints, it can also affect the spine, causing back pain and, in severe cases, destruction of the joints. Inflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis: may cause a characteristic rheumatoid arthritis rash of spots which look like ulcers, and a wide variety of other symptoms, depending on the location of the affected blood vessels. Inflammation of the skin, leading to multiple skin disorders, such as chronic hives, a rash also known as urticaria. Inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart, known as Pericarditis : may cause chest pain and shortness of breath.",
    "prevention": "While there is no known way to prevent the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, there are a few known ways in which a person can reduce the risk. These include: Quitting tobacco smoking Being physically active and eating a healthy diet Taking steps to maintain a healthy weight It is also important to see a doctor as soon as symptoms develop, as early treatment can greatly minimize the rheumatoid arthritis progression, as well as any permanent damage caused by flare ups.",
    "rheumatoid_arthritis_faqs": "Q: Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis – what is the difference? A: Both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are types of chronic, untreatable arthritis which may be confused due to having the similar symptom of joint pain and inflammation. However, they have different causes. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease typically with a sudden onset of symptoms and occurs in episodes of inflammation on symmetrical joints of the body. OA is a “wear and tear” condition associated with factors such as older age, injury or obesity. It develops slowly, caused by continuous use of particular joints. RA tends to involve additional symptoms such as fever and fatigue, whereas OA only affects the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis onset tends to occur from 30 to 60 years old, while OA tends to develop later in life. 22 Q: Is rheumatoid arthritis hereditary? A: Rheumatoid arthritis is not hereditary but a person’s genetics can increase the chances of developing the condition, and a number of genetic markers have been identified that increase this risk. However, not everyone with RA has these, nor does everyone who has such genetic markers develop RA. Many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in whether a person develops rheumatoid arthritis. 23 Q: Is rheumatoid arthritis a disability? A: If RA is not treated early, it can cause irreversible damage to joints, leading to disability. However, it can normally be well managed with medications to slow down the immune system, as well as pain medications for relief of symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis is not usually categorized as a disability in itself. However, it may qualify a person for benefits and other disability rights in certain countries, such as the U.S., if the person experiences significant limitations in their abilities due to the condition. Q: Are there different types of rheumatoid arthritis? A: Some researchers believe that rheumatoid arthritis may actually be a collection of conditions, with genetic differences affecting the features of the disease. The most recognized differences in rheumatoid arthritis are between the seropositive and seronegative versions of the condition. Seropositive RA has anti-CCPs and/or rheumatoid factor present (see laboratory tests , while seronegative RA does not. Distinguishing between types may help doctors to find the best possible treatment. 24 Q: What are the 4 stages of rheumatoid arthritis? A: Sometimes doctors divide RA up into four stages of progression, as this helps them to consider what treatment will be best. The four stages are as follows: 25 26 Stage 1: Early stage RA involves swelling of involved joints and pain with motion. There is generally not very much X-ray evidence of joint destruction. Stage 2: Moderate RA involves destruction of cartilage and narrowing of the joint. Stage 3: Severe RA involves pannus formation (see causes . Loss of joint cartilage exposes bone, leading to evident changes on X-ray, and joint deformities may become evident to the naked eye. Stage 4: In terminal or end stage RA the inflammatory process has subsided, and the formation of scar tissue and/or fusing of bone results in ceased joint function. There may be nodule formation (see complications ). Q: Is rheumatoid arthritis fatal?** A: No. However, complications of the condition may shorten lifespan by a few years in some people. Those with RA may have a higher risk of developing lung or heart problems, as well as infections, cancers and stomach problems, which may be life-threatening. Recent improvements in control of RA are likely to mean that the average lifespan of people with RA will improve. 27 Q: What are the signs of rheumatoid arthritis vs osteoarthritis in the hands? A: Arthritis in the hands normally manifests differently in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The first signs of rheumatoid arthritis, which normally manifests in many joints throughout the body, are often in the hands, possibly causing dactylitis, an inflammation of the finger, in which the knuckles may disappear, giving the fingers the appearance of sausages. In osteoarthritis, arthritis develops gradually over a long period of time, and early signs may go unnoticed or ignored. It is often associated with a deep pain under the base of the thumb. Q: What causes rheumatoid arthritis flare ups? A: Some flare ups are unpredictable, without a known trigger. Others may have a known trigger. These may include: 28 29 Physical activity Poor sleep Stress An infection Q: What does rheumatoid arthritis feel like? **A: The main symptom of rheumatoid arthritis is stiffness, swelling and pain in the joints, particularly first thing in the morning. Typically, this affects the hands and feet and is symmetrical. Many people also experience fatigue or flu-like symptoms. One of the main factors to point to a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis is loss of function, i.e. one’s normal abilities, such as finding buttons difficult to fasten. If you are wondering whether your symptoms point to a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis, try the Ada app for a free assessment. Q: Can rheumatoid arthritis be cured? A: There is currently no rheumatoid arthritis cure, and it is usually a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment. However, early treatment and lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and quitting smoking, can reduce the risk of joint damage, disability and reduce inflammation, pain and swelling. Q: Can rheumatoid arthritis go away? A: No, it is a lifelong condition. However, with treatment some people have long periods of remission, in which symptoms are not felt, and the progression of the condition is halted. Q: Psoriatic arthritis vs rheumatoid arthritis – what is the difference? A: Both are types of long-term inflammatory arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is associated psoriasis, a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin with silvery scales, known as plaques . While rheumatoid arthritis normally occurs in symmetrical flare ups, psoriatic arthritis normally occurs in asymmetric flare ups. People with rheumatoid arthritis may also have psoriasis without having psoriatic arthritis. Read more about the different types of arthritis » ]",

    "condition": "Rickets",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/rickets/",
    "what_is_rickets": "Rickets is a bone disease in children and adolescents. A vitamin D or calcium deficiency weakens the bone substance, making the bones soft and curved. Children with rickets can suffer from bone pain and can grow slower than other children. Rickets can be successfully treated by taking sufficient vitamin D and calcium in the form of a balanced diet and/or vitamin supplements. If left untreated, it can lead to prolonged growth problems and severe bone deformities. A similar disease can also occur in adults and is referred to as osteomalacia 1 . If you think that you might have rickets, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_causes_rickets": "Rickets can have different causes, which include: vitamin D and/or calcium deficiency hereditary disease running in families underlying systemic diseases.\n\nA vitamin D deficiency is by far the most common cause of rickets. It can also cause a calcium deficiency because the absorption rate decreases. It’s fairly rare, but there could also be the case where too little calcium is ingested through food. For a sufficient supply of vitamin D to the body, it is important that the skin is exposed to daylight in addition to a balanced diet.For the large majority of children, this already ensures a sufficient supply. 2 , 3 , 4 Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in children include: 5 Dark skin type Dark skin contains more melanin than light skin. This means that  more sunlight is needed for the production of vitamin D. Lack of sunlight Children who spend most of their time indoors or who are not     exposed to sunlight for other reasons produce less vitamin D.     Particularly during the winter months and especially in countries far from the equator, the sunlight is not strong enough for the body to produce sufficient vitamin D. This is especially true for children who spend most of their time indoors or are otherwise not exposed to sunlight. Breastfeeding Children who are exclusively breastfed and have a darker skin type and/or if the mother herself has a vitamin D deficiency have an increased risk. However, as breastfeeding has many health benefits, it should not be avoided. A doctor can help you develop an optimal breastfeeding plan.\n\nIn rare cases, rickets can be genetically inherited. The most common hereditary form is called hypophosphatemic rickets. This form is based on mutations in several genes relevant for phosphate metabolism. As a result, the kidneys lose their ability to retain the body’s phosphate and therefore increasingly excrete it in the urine. Since phosphate plays a central role in bone formation and development, a deficiency causes rickets. 6 , 7\n\nCertain diseases such as celiac disease , Crohn's disease , liver , or kidney disease can affect the way the body absorbs or metabolizes vitamins and minerals. This can lead to vitamin D, phosphate, and/or calcium deficiency. 6",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of rickets can be: 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 Growth and developmental disorders Children with rickets can be significantly lower than average in growth and development due to their impaired bone metabolism. Pain The bones can be painful, especially when pressure is exerted on them or if strained. Sometimes affected children avoid walking or standing up from a seated position. Some children will walk in a gentle gait. Bone fractures The bone substance is often diminished and thus weakened, which leads to an increased probability of fractures. Dental problems This can be accompanied by defective enamel, slower tooth development, and an increased risk of tooth decay. Deformities The ankles, wrists, and knees may be thickened. The long bones of the arms and legs may be considerably curved. In addition, softening of the skull bone and – more rarely – curving of the spine are possible. Muscle weakness Muscle tension may be reduced – leading to delays in reaching certain developmental milestones such as sitting, standing, walking, and jumping. Epileptic seizures Reduced calcium levels can cause epileptic seizures. Susceptibility to disease Children with rickets are particularly susceptible to infectious diseases. If one of these symptoms is present, a doctor should be consulted immediately. Many of these symptoms may also occur in adults with osteomalacia . However, adults with osteomalacia most often complain of bone pain than children with rickets. Good to know:\n\nBow legs, also referred to as genu varum, is when a person stands in an upright position and his or her legs curve outward at the knees while the ankles touch.Many people first think of rickets when they see a person with this type of misalignment. However, there are a number of other causes for this type of malpositioning. These include certain blood disorders, congenital bone diseases, and small stature. However, in most cases, especially if the person has no further symptoms, bow legs are not pathological and are therefore completely unproblematic.\n\nIf you think that you might have rickets, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "how_is_rickets_diagnosed": "In order to diagnose rickets, the following information is usually obtained by a doctor: 6 , 9 , 11 Anamnesis The doctor asks questions about nutrition and daily exposure to sunlight as well as medical history. Blood tests The blood levels of vitamin D, calcium, phosphate, and parathormone are of particular interest. Liver and kidney function are also usually assessed. Urine sample Depending on the results from anamnesis and blood analysis, a urine sample can also be examined in some cases. X-rays X-rays are typically taken when rickets are suspected in order to detect skeletal changes or deformities. The child’s bone density can also be analyzed.",
    "what_is_the_treatment_for_rickets": "If rickets is caused by a lack of vitamin D or calcium, the intake must be increased accordingly. The affected person should seek medical advice. There are several approaches that should be considered: 12 Nutrition The affected person should eat more foods rich in vitamin D and calcium. These include oily fish, whole grain bread, oat flakes, and eggs for vitamin D, as well as green leafy vegetables, almonds, and dairy products for calcium. Food supplements Vitamin D and calcium can also be substituted using dietary supplements. Vitamin D injection An injection with a syringe into a muscle is usually only performed if no other options are available or have been successful. The injection should then be repeated at annual intervals. Exposure to sunlight Particularly if the person lives in countries far away from the equator and/or spends a lot of time indoors, sufficient sun exposure must be ensured. A doctor can help weigh sun protection against sun exposure. The treatment of hereditary rickets depends on the exact form. Hypophosphatemic rickets, the most common genetic form, usually requires treatment with phosphate and vitamin D supplements.",
    "can_rickets_be_prevented": "To ensure that the necessary amount of calcium and/or vitamin D is ingested through food intake or produced by the body, various measures can be taken: 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 A balanced diet that consists of foods rich in vitamin D and calcium These include oily fish, whole grain bread, oat flakes and eggs for vitamin D, as well as green leafy vegetables, almonds and dairy products for calcium. Spending sufficient time in the sun Take care to avoid sunburn and other complications caused by excessive exposure to sunlight. Depending on where you live, the season, your skin type and how much skin is covered by clothing, the time required to produce enough vitamin D will vary. Taking vitamin supplements This is an option after talking to a doctor about the individual needs and the most appropriate type and dose.",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_rickets": "The prognosis depends on the exact cause of rickets. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis of rickets is generally good. However, a complete recovery can take some time. Most children with rickets caused by vitamin D deficiency respond well to treatment with vitamin D and calcium. Most bone deformities caused by rickets can improve on their own during growth. However, orthopedic correction may be necessary. In very severe cases, surgery may be recommended. 16 , 17",
    "what_are_the_complications": "Side effects of vitamin D or calcium preparations: The administration of vitamin D or calcium supplements rarely leads to side effects. However, if the wrong dose of calcium is administered, this can lead to so-called hypercalcemia, in which too much calcium is present in the blood.

    "condition": "Rosacea",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/rosacea/",
    "what_is_rosacea": "Rosacea is a skin condition that affects the face. It is not contagious, but it is very common: in the United Kingdom, for example, about one in 10 adults are affected, 1 and, according to recent statistics, over 16 million Americans. 2 Rosacea is not a type of acne, and the term “acne rosacea” is misleading. However, acne and rosacea may occur together. Unlike acne, rosacea is more common among older people, particularly those aged between 40 and 60 years of age. 3 It is somewhat more common among women than men, but tends to be more severe in men. 4 Also, unlike acne, rosacea does not cause scarring. ref2 Rosacea usually affects the skin of the face, particularly the nose, cheeks and forehead. 1 In some cases, it can affect the skin of the neck, chest and ears, and rarely, it can affect the eye. Rosacea is not always itchy or painful, but may cause a stinging or burning sensation. It can also be unsightly and distressing to those affected by it. ref1 Its most prominent symptoms are facial redness and flushing. A rare effect of rosacea is rhinophyma, a thickening of the skin on and around the nose that leads to a characteristic red and bumpy appearance. 1 This is usually found in older male sufferers.\n\nThere are several subtypes of rosacea: 5 6 Erythromatotelangiectactic, characterized by skin redness and visible small blood vessels. Papulopustular, characterized by papules (small pimples) and pustules (small pimples containing pus). Phymatous (both mild and severe subtypes), marked by thickened skin . Ocular, affecting the eyes . Treatment depends on which sort of rosacea is present. People suspected of having rosacea, particularly those who suffer from ocular rosacea or from symptoms that are resistant to treatment, should generally be treated by a specialist such as a dermatologist or ophthalmologist.",
    "symptoms": "Because rosacea is common, most competent medical practitioners will be able to diagnose it based on the patient’s history and the appearance of their skin. In some cases, doctors may recommend that blood tests are done, in order to rule out other conditions that cause skin redness, such as systemic lupus erythematosus . 1 The symptoms of rosacea are distinctive. They include: 1 3 4 A tendency to blush or flush easily, leading to transient redness, also known as erythema Dilated and visible blood vessels under the surface of the skin, known as telangiectasia Red bumps, known as papules, and pustules, slightly resembling mild acne Thickened skin, known as phymatous changes Eye problems, such as sore eyelids and dry eyes. The symptoms of rosacea tend to begin mildly, but worsen with time. People affected will first notice an increased tendency to blush or flush, with skin redness taking longer and longer to fade. Over time, the redness will become permanent. The intensity of facial flushing can be affected by emotion, hydration, chemicals and stress. 7 In some cases of rosacea, small blood vessels under the skin become more prominent. Itching is sometimes present, and redness is often accompanied by a burning sensation. Affected people may find that their skin is hot to the touch during a flushing episode. If you are experiencing symptoms such as these listed here, you can find out more by doing a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time.\n\nOcular rosacea is a complication of the condition. Symptoms include: 3 5 8 Itchy, burning or stinging eyes. Dry, scratchy eyes. A feeling of grit or a foreign body in the eye. Photosensitivity (sensitivity to light). Inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), styes, or cysts. Chalazions, which are small, usually painless lumps on the eyelid, caused by blocked oil or meibomian glands. These are not to be confused with styes, which result from infection. Styes are painful and tend to occur near the eyelashes. Inflammation of the cornea, the transparent front covering of the eye, is rare but serious, and can affect vision. If corneal inflammation, also known as rosacea keratitis, occurs, seek medical help as soon as possible. 3",
    "causes": "The exact cause of rosacea has not yet been established. It is possible that it is an autoimmune response, a reaction to high skin pH, a response to undiagnosed food sensitivity or the result of a high number of demodex folliculorum mites on the face. 1 7 There may also be a genetic component. According to present knowledge, there is no way to prevent rosacea from beginning, and there is currently no way to entirely eliminate the condition. 1 There is some evidence that rosacea’s facial flushing is caused by the body’s sympathetic nervous system becoming stimulated. 7 The sympathetic nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is involved in activating the fight or flight response. It is activated by strong emotion or physical stress. Research has shown that rosacea can be triggered by various physical and environmental factors, such as weather conditions, exercise, cosmetics or certain foods. Many people with rosacea find it helpful to keep a diary of their outbreaks in order to narrow down what their particular triggers are. Some common triggers are: 1 7 9 Emotional stress Strenuous exercise Exposure to strong sunlight Hot weather Cold weather Wind High humidity Hot baths/showers Exfoliant, abrasive or astringent facial products Makeup containing oils Perfumed sunblocks Sunblock or skin preparations containing insect repellents Consumption of alcohol Very sugary foods Spicy foods, such as those containing chili Smoking Calcium-channel blockers, also known as calcium antagonists, such as dihydropyridine. Not all rosacea sufferers are vulnerable to all of these triggers. Many of these triggers, such as exercise, alcohol and calcium antagonists, cause the dilation of the blood vessels (vasodilation), which increases blood flow. Increased blood flow to the skin causes a distinctive appearance of redness. Some of these triggers, for example exposure to sunlight, wind, smoking and cold weather, cause inflammation of the skin, which also causes redness.",
    "treatment_and_management": "Although there is currently no total cure for rosacea, there are many treatment options. Treatment may need to be long-term, but it is easily manageable and very effective. Treatment for rosacea is mainly concerned with reducing inflammation and managing sensitive skin. 3 Treatment options include topical creams and ointments, oral medications, and lifestyle changes. People with this condition may find that some treatments, or combinations of treatments, work better for them than others do.\n\nTopical preparations, which are applied to the skin rather than taken orally, can help rosacea sufferers lessen the redness and inflammation they experience. Commonly-prescribed topical rosacea treatments include: 1 3 4 5 Brimonidine cream Azelaic acid cream Sodium sulfacetamide-sulfur cream Doxycycline ointment Metronidazole cream Some rosacea sufferers find that applying jojoba oil is helpful. 10 However, people with rosacea should never use acne preparations and should avoid topical corticosteroids, unless they are specifically prescribed by a specialist. While topical steroid preparations are helpful in reducing inflammation in the short term, in the long term they can make the problem worse. 3 In cases where the rosacea is mild, it may be possible to manage it with only topical creams and lifestyle changes.\n\nIn cases of severe rosacea, laser and light treatments are an option for the treatment of redness, inflammation, pustules and rhinophyma. Nonablative lasers that do not destroy tissue, in the 500 to 600 nanometer (nm) range, and long-pulsed pulse dye lasers, as well as 532nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate lasers can help alleviate rosacea symptoms. Intense pulsed-light devices in the 515 to 1200nm range are another option. 11 Phymatous rosacea, which causes thickening of the skin and may cause rhinophyma, can be treated with ablative lasers that destroy tissue, such as erbium or CO2 lasers. The object of this treatment is to remove the overgrowth of tissue from the area. 11\n\nIn severe cases, some people with rosacea find that a course of oral antibiotics helps reduce inflammation. This is true even though it is not known whether there are any particular bacteria involved in causing rosacea. Oral antibiotics that are sometimes used to treat rosacea include the tetracycline class: 3 Tetracycline Oxytetracycline Doxycycline Lymecycline Minocycline. A course of 40mg of oral doxycycline daily is often effective. If doxycycline is not an option, 100mg of oral minocycline daily has been found to be effective as well. 12 Other oral medications include: 3 5 6 Erythromycin Trimethoprim Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole Ampicillin Clindamycin Dapsone. Blushing and redness may also be managed by beta-blockers or clonidine. 3 Very severe rosacea, especially phymatous rosacea that may lead to rhinophyma, or thickening of the skin, may respond well to isotretinoin. 6 The length of time for which an individual may have to take antibiotics depends on how severe their rosacea is and how well they respond to antibiotic treatment. However, it is important that all courses of antibiotics prescribed for rosacea are completed in order to assess whether they were effective. In most cases, improvement can be expected within two to three weeks of beginning a course of antibiotics, but it may take several months to completely clear up symptoms such as papules and pustules. 1 Moreover, pustules and papules may return when the antibiotic course is over. If this happens, a longer-term course of maintenance doses of antibiotics might be effective. Antibiotics can have serious side effects, so the use of oral antibiotic treatments should only be considered when topical treatments and lifestyle changes have proved to be ineffective in reducing severe rosacea.\n\nOcular rosacea affects the eyes rather than the skin, and so the treatment program is quite different in some ways. It may cause inflammation of the eyelid (blepharitis), which is painful and may increase the risk of infection. 8 Styes, cysts and chalazions may also occur. 13 The first line of treatment for ocular rosacea is to improve eyelid hygiene. This is done by using: Artificial tears to moisten and lubricate the eye, and reduce irritation. Care should be taken to use only eye drops that mimic natural tears. Never touch the surface of the eyeball or eyelid with the nozzle of the bottle. 5 8 A warm compress, using a clean cloth soaked with very warm water held against each eye for five to 10 minutes. The cloth should be remoistened with warm water regularly. This reduces inflammation, cleans the eyelid and provides relief from stinging. 8 To remove irritants such as dust, grit and secretions from the eyelid and eyelashes, wipes with a physiological salt solution, i.e.one that mimics the eye’s natural moisture, can be used. Pharmacists can help if necessary. 8 Thereafter, antibiotics in several forms may be used: Topical antibiotic creams, gels or drops containing ciclosporin or metronidazole Oral antibiotics such as azithromycin or a tetracyline 5 A course of oral oxytetracycline followed by an eight-week course of topical metronidazole has been found to alleviate symptoms. 13 . Otherwise, oral tetracyline taken once daily, along with topical ivermectin and/or azelaic acid, may be helpful. People with ocular rosacea or irritated eyes as a result of rosacea should avoid eye makeup, rubbing their eyes and taking Omega 3 supplements. Wearing contact lenses may be uncomfortable with inflamed eyes. 8\n\nAside from using prescription antibiotics, people with rosacea can take easy steps at home to get relief from the discomfort of rosacea and the appearance of symptoms. For many people, this involves, learning to avoid triggers and removing irritants from their care regimes.\n\nGenerally, people with rosacea will find it helpful to avoid getting sunburned. If exposure to strong sunlight cannot be avoided, a strong sunblock should be used with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or more, as well as UVB and UVA protection. People with rosacea who regularly shave their faces, should switch from a traditional bladed razor to an electric razor. Electric razors do not come into such tight contact with the skin and are therefore less irritating. Cleansers used by people with rosacea should not contain abrasives, including organic abrasives such as crushed apricot kernels, alcohol or acetone. Perfumed soaps, moisturisers and washes should be avoided. Oil-based or waterproof makeup should be avoided. Insect-repellent facial moisturisers or sunblock should not be used. Hypoallergenic, non-greasy, non-perfumed emollient preparations can be used. Over-the-counter acne preparations are not helpful to people with rosacea. They may make the symptoms worse and should be avoided.\n\nPeople with rosacea, who smoke tobacco cigarettes or regularly consume alcohol, may find it useful to cut back their consumption. Smoking dries the skin, while alcohol widens blood vessels and therefore worsens the redness of skin. As stress is known to make rosacea symptoms worse, learning to manage stressful situations and general life stress is recommended by many rosacea groups, such as the International Rosacea Foundation and the National Rosacea Society . 7 10 Weight management can assist in the alleviation of redness, while maintaining good hydration by drinking enough water is believed to help lessen the redness and inflammation characteristic of rosacea. A diet low in processed carbohydrates may also be helpful in some cases, as carbohydrates cause blood glucose to increase, which can lead to vasodilation and thus redness. 10 In people who have severe rosacea, or feel that the appearance of their symptoms is negatively impacting their quality of life, learning to apply camouflage makeup may be helpful. Many regional health communities can arrange access to camouflage makeup tutorials and workshops.",
    "faqs": "Q: How do I know whether my skin condition is acne or rosacea? A: Both rosacea and acne are common inflammatory disorders of the skin. 14 Many people with papulopustular rosacea have pimples and spots that resemble the symptoms of acne. Moreover, people with rosacea may also have acne. However, one way to distinguish between acne and rosacea is to compare which areas of the body are affected. Acne can affect the face, neck, chest, back and shoulders, while rosacea mostly affects only the face. In acne, blackheads are often prominent, but they are seldom found in rosacea. Acne tends not to be accompanied by the reddening of skin that is rosacea’s most obvious characteristic. Acne very seldom causes inflammation of the eyelids or eye discomfort. 15 Age of onset for rosacea tends to be later in life than for acne; acne is more common among teenagers and young adults, while rosacea is more common among people approaching middle age. 16 If you are experiencing a skin condition, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time. If you are concerned about whether the condition affecting you is acne or rosacea, it is best to consult your primary care physician or a dermatologist. Q: Will over-the-counter preparations help my rosacea? A: No, they will not. In fact, some over-the-counter preparations, particularly those for the treatment of acne, may make rosacea worse. The best course of treatment for rosacea involves a very gentle skincare regime and learning to avoid triggers. In severe cases, prescription antibiotics may be used."

    "what_is_roseola_infantum": "Roseola infantum – also called roseola, three-day rash or three-day fever, exanthem subitum, pseudo-rubella or sixth disease – is a typically mild, self-limiting viral infection that mainly affects infants and toddlers. It causes a high fever, which is often followed by a rash on the trunk (torso) that may spread to the face, arms and legs. 1 The rash is typically characterized by small, painless pink or red spots that turn white when pressed firmly. The spots may be flat or raised and may be surrounded by a white ring. The rash can fade quickly, within a few hours of appearing, or remain for a couple of days. 1 2 Roseola is most common in children between six months and two years of age. Most children have been exposed to roseola before they are five years old and develop the antibodies to avoid repeat infection. However, roseola is occasionally contracted by older children, or adults who have not previously encountered it. If adults contract roseola, the symptoms are usually very mild. 3 4 It is possible to have roseola more than once, but this is unusual, unless the person has a compromised immune system. 5 Roseola is caused by two viruses in the herpes family: HHV, or human herpes virus, most often type 6 or occasionally type 7. The virus is spread via droplet infection, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact with an infected person or item that was, for example, sneezed on by an infected person. 4 This kind of herpes infection does not lead to herpes labialis or genital sores . 6 Most children make a full and fast recovery from roseola without any specific treatment other than rest and adequate hydration. 7 Over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Paracetamol or Tylenol), may be recommended to help with symptoms like the fever. ref1",
    "roseola_infantum_symptoms": "Following exposure to and infection with one of the two viruses that causes roseola infantum, symptoms typically appear after an incubation period of approximately 9 to 10 days, though this can  generally be between 5 and 15 days. 1 The incubation period is the time between catching an infection and symptoms appearing. The first symptom is rapidly occurring high fever above 100.4 F or 38 C. The fever can last from three to seven days, and a rash typically develops after the fever passes. 3 4 Common initial signs of roseola infantum may include: 1 4 7 Sudden development of high fever up to 104 F or 40 C Irritability Tiredness Pink or red spots (called Nagayama spots) at the back of the throat and on the uvula 2 Runny nose Loss of appetite Swollen glands in the neck Less common signs may include: Irritated eyes and swollen eyelids Inflamed tympanic (ear drum) membranes Vomiting Diarrhea Sore throat Cough Some people experience practically no symptoms of roseola. 3 However, they may still be contagious, i.e., able to transmit the virus to others. Practising good hygiene can help prevent the spread of roseola and many other diseases. If you or your child are experiencing possible symptoms of roseola infantum, try using the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.\n\nWhen the fever passes, a distinct rash will often appear on the chest, back and stomach, sometimes spreading to the arms and legs and occasionally the face too. The rash is usually characterized by small pink or red spots that turn white when pressed. Some of the spots may have a white ring around them. 1 2 The rash may have a raised appearance or remain flat, and it does not itch or hurt. It can fade within a few hours or persist for a couple of days. 1 2 7 The infection is usually over by the time the rash develops, and most children feel well again. As the fever and early symptoms can mimic other conditions, roseola is sometimes hard to diagnose. The fever appears before the characteristic rash, and high fevers can have quite a few other causes in infants and toddlers. This is why doctors usually diagnose roseola based on the appearance of the rash. 3",
    "causes": "Roseola is most commonly caused by human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), though it can also be caused by human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7). These types of herpes are different to the strains that cause cold sores and genital herpes . 4 The virus is spread through droplets of fluid from the mouth, throat and nose, for example when a person coughs or sneezes. Contact with a person who has roseola, or items that have been contaminated with infected droplets can result in the virus being transmitted. 4",
    "diagnosis": "A doctor will typically diagnose roseola after taking the child’s or adult’s medical history and performing a physical examination. They will consider the signs and symptoms and rule out other common illnesses that cause a rash, such as measles or rubella (German measles) . Laboratory blood tests may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of roseola, but these are only rarely used, e.g. for very unclear presentations or people with a compromised immune system. 4",
    "prevention": "While it may not always be possible to prevent roseola, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of developing the condition. These include: 7 Washing the hands thoroughly and often, with warm, not too hot, water and soap Teaching children to sneeze and cough into tissues and to dispose of them in a sanitary manner Avoiding the sharing of cups, plates, and cutlery Regularly disinfecting surfaces around the home There is no vaccination to prevent roseola.",
    "roseola_infantum_treatment_and_medication_medication": "Roseola and the rash typically go away on their own without any special treatment. A child or adult with roseola can usually recover at home. The fever can be managed using techniques including: Drinking lots of fluids Getting plenty of rest Dressing in cool clothing Applying a cool cloth to the head As roseola is a viral infection, antibiotics are not prescribed. Over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be given in appropriate doses to reduce fever and pain. Aspirin should never be given to treat a fever in children or young adults under 19 years of age, as it increases their risk of developing Reye’s syndrome , a life-threatening condition. The roseola virus remains in the body for life, making reactivation or reinfection possible at a later stage. This is more likely to occur if the person becomes immunocompromised, for example, while undergoing treatment for cancer or receiving a bone marrow transplant. 8 If a child has a severely weakened immune system, the doctor may prescribe the antiviral drug ganciclovir to help treat the roseola and avoid complications. ref2",
    "complications": "Roseola typically does not cause any complications. However, in some children, up to 15 percent of cases, the high fever can cause febrile seizures (fever seizures) . 1 4 In very rare cases, roseola can lead to other complications like encephalitis, i.e., an inflammation of brain structures. The risk of this occurring is higher in children and adults with weakened immune systems. 4 If you or your child are experiencing symptoms you are worried about, try using the free Ada app to find out what the problem may be.\n\nFebrile seizures are convulsions and periods of unresponsiveness that typically last for a few minutes. They can be alarming, but are seldom harmful. 1 9 10 If a child has no history of febrile seizures but seems to be experiencing one, an ambulance should be called without delay to be on the safe side or the child taken to a hospital or urgent care treatment center to receive a proper workup of the condition. 11 10 In children with a history of febrile seizures, it is recommended that caregivers note the start time of a seizure and, should it continue for more than five minutes, call an ambulance immediately. Similarly, if the seizure ends within five minutes, but the child does not recover quickly and return to normal, an ambulance should be called. 10 During a febrile seizure, the child should not be restrained, but placed on the ground or another appropriate, safe surface, and positioned on their side or stomach. If there is anything in the child’s mouth, this should be gently removed, if it is possible to do so without causing harm to the child or caregiver. Nothing should ever be placed in a child's or any person’s mouth during a convulsion. 10 Read more about Febrile Seizures »",
    "when_to_see_a_doctor": "Most children recover from roseola within a week of the onset of the fever. However, a doctor should be contacted if the rash lasts longer than one week or if the fever, rash or other symptoms worsen instead of getting better. A doctor should be called immediately if the symptoms become so severe at any point that the child or caregiver cannot cope with them.",

    "roseola_infantum_faqs": "Q: Can adults get roseola? A: Adults can get roseola, but this is rare. Due to previous exposure, most adults are immune to the virus. If an adult does contract roseola, the symptoms are usually milder than in infants or children. Q: Is roseola contagious? A: Yes, the viruses that cause roseola, herpes virus 6 or 7, are contagious. They are spread through droplets of fluid released when a person coughs or sneezes, for example. Contact with these droplets, e.g. through inhaling them, can lead to the virus being transmitted from one person to another. Q: Can you get roseola more than once? A: Yes, but this is rare. It is most likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system. Q: How can one tell the difference between roseola and measles? A: The rashes associated with roseola and measles are frequently confused, but they have different appearances. The roseola rash is pinkish-red and typically begins on the trunk (belly and back), then spreads to the extremities and sometimes the face. The spots are distinct and may be surrounded by a white ring. The roseola rash develops when the fever disappears and typically clears within a couple of days. The measles rash, on the other hand, is brownish-red and usually spreads from the face down to the rest of the body, with the spots running into each other and creating a blotchy or bumpy appearance. When the rash appears, a person may develop a high fever and feel very unwell. The rash typically persists for 5-6 days. 3 12 13 Read more about measles » Q: Is roseola related to chickenpox or shingles? A: The viruses that cause roseola, chickenpox and shingles are all members of the large herpesviridae family of viruses. The viruses, therefore, are related, but not the same. Although the conditions share some common symptoms, such as fever and tiredness, they also differ in several ways, including in their severity and the treatment options available. Q: When can a child with roseola return to school? A: A child with roseola can usually return to school and other activities after their temperature has returned to normal and they feel well again. 7 A healthcare practitioner can advise on the best time of return for each child. Q: Is a pregnant person at risk of passing roseola on to her fetus? A: Most adults are immune to roseola infection due to previous exposure. Even if a pregnant person does contract roseola, the risk that they will pass it on to their unborn baby, or that it will cause complications for the fetus, appears to be very low. 14 15"

    "what_is_rubella": "Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious virus that usually affects children, but can be caught by adults. Symptoms are generally mild and pass within 7 to 10 days, often only needing minor intervention. However, the rubella virus can cause serious birth defects if caught by a pregnant person; this is referred to as congenital rubella syndrome. 1\n\nVaccination programs have had success in reducing the number of cases of rubella worldwide. According to The World Health Organization, several countries have eradicated rubella and congenital rubella syndrome altogether because of their vaccination programs. 2 Rubella was eliminated in the United States in 2004. Now, approximately 10 cases of rubella are reported in the U.S. every year. These rare cases are caused by people coming into contact with the virus while traveling abroad. 3",
    "rubella_symptoms": "Many people will experience no symptoms at all when they contract rubella. If symptoms do appear, they will usually present at around two to three weeks after the initial infection. This time lag is known as the incubation period. 4 Rubella symptoms include: 5 6 7 8 9 Swollen lymph glands, particularly behind the ears and on the back of the head Mild fever , less than 39 degrees Celsius or 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit Conjunctivitis / pink eye Cold-like symptoms, such as a cough, sore throat or runny nose Aching feelings in the body Feeling cold Loss of appetite Headache Nausea Pain in eyes when looking up and to sides Red spots on the roof of the mouth Sore or aching joints ; more likely to be experienced by adult women and teenage girls A rash may be the most noticeable symptom of rubella. The rash will typically develop one to five days after other symptoms and will be recognizable by: Pink, pinpoint bumps on a red, flat patch of skin, also known as a maculopapular rash 10 Rash first appearing on the face, then spreading downwards, towards the trunk and limbs Rash covers most of the body within 24 hours The rash tends to last three to five days . Other symptoms begin earlier and generally last around a week. 6 Symptoms of rubella are similar in adults and children. If you or a loved one is experiencing symptoms that may be linked to rubella, the free Ada app is ready to carry out a symptom assessment now.",
    "complications": "The main complication of rubella is that birth defects can occur when a pregnant person without immunity comes into contact with the virus. This is called congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). See the Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) section below for more information. In rare cases, rubella may cause bleeding or problems with the brain. 11",
    "causes": "Rubella is caused by a contagious virus. It is transmitted in a similar way to the common cold and the flu , i.e. by coming into contact with droplets of moisture coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. It is also possible to contract the virus through contact with the urine of an infected person. 4 Symptoms of rubella typically develop two to three weeks after coming into contact with the virus. People infected with the virus become contagious and may infect others from one week before symptoms appear until four to seven days after the rash has disappeared. 6 Roughly 25 to 50 percent of people infected with rubella may not develop symptoms at all, but can still spread the virus. 12",
    "risk_factors": "Symptoms of rubella in adults and children are generally not serious. The main risk posed by rubella is to pregnant people and their developing fetus . See the Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) section below. Rubella is very rare in countries where immunization against the virus is routine. However, according to the CDC and WHO, approximately 100,000 babies are born around the world each year with congenital rubella syndrome, with the vast majority of cases reported in Africa and Southeast Asia. 2 13 In countries with a vaccination program, the main risk of catching rubella is for an unvaccinated person to come into contact with an infected person.\n\nThe rubella virus is still present in large areas of: 13 Africa South and Southeast Asia The Middle East In recent years there have been rubella outbreaks in Poland and Japan. 14 The CDC recommends that anyone over the age of one should be vaccinated with MMR before travelling . Women in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, who do not have immunity to rubella, should not travel to areas where rubella is present. 13",
    "diagnosing_rubella": "Symptoms such as a rash and swollen glands may indicate rubella, but a blood or saliva test is the only way to definitively diagnose infection. The blood test is sometimes referred to as an antibody titer test, which is a way of measuring antibodies in a blood sample. 15 Blood and saliva tests for rubella check for antibody levels in the body. There are two types of antibody that indicate rubella: 6 16 IgM antibody: this antibody will be present if someone has recently been infected with rubella. IgM antibodies can be detected a few days after the rash first occurs. IgG antibody: this antibody will be present if someone has been vaccinated against rubella or has been infected in the past. A diagnosis using the IgG antibody needs a test as close as possible to the initial phase of infection, the results of which are compared to a further test two to three weeks later. If rubella is suspected, always contact the doctor before visiting the surgery. Rubella is contagious, and the doctor will likely want to prepare for the visit to limit the risk of infecting others.",
    "rubella_and_pregnancy": "The health risks posed by rubella are most severe if the affected person is in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy , as the virus can cause serious birth defects and health problems to the baby. This is known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). 17 A blood or saliva test can confirm whether or not there are antibodies in the blood that can provide immunity against rubella or if an infection has happened recently. The CDC recommends testing for rubella-related antibodies before getting pregnant. If there are not enough antibodies present, the MMR vaccine should be administered. 18 MMR contains a weakened version of the rubella virus, so women should wait 30 days before getting pregnant. 18 19 Women should not be vaccinated during pregnancy. 20 If a pregnant person comes into contact with a person with rubella or develops symptoms, they should contact their doctor immediately. The pregnant person’s IgG antibody levels will be checked for immunity. It may be possible to perform a so-called passive immunization, where a person receives supplemental antibodies. If congenital rubella infection is suspected, ultrasound scans will be offered to look for signs of developmental problems in the fetus. 6\n\nCongenital rubella syndrome (CRS) occurs when someone in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and without protective immunity against rubella, is exposed to the virus. Congenital rubella syndrome affects the fetus as it develops in the womb. CRS is very rare in the United States because of widespread immunization. Between 2005 and 2015, just eight babies in the U.S. were born with CRS. 19 Symptoms of CRS affect the baby, and include: 11 19 Congenital heart disease Deafness Eye defects, such as cataracts or glaucoma Low birth weight Learning difficulties A smaller head than usual, known as microcephaly Liver damage Rubella infection during the first trimester of pregnancy poses the most risk to the developing fetus, but the risk does not strongly reduce until after 20 weeks: 17 Infection within the first 10 weeks results in a 90 percent chance of CRS with the baby having multiple defects Infection between 11 to 16 weeks results in a 10-20 percent chance of CRS with babies having some, but fewer, defects Infection between 17 to 20 weeks brings a very low chance of CRS, with the only likely defect being deafness There is no cure for CRS, only prevention through vaccination.\n\nCongenital rubella infection is a term used to encompass all of the possible effects on the fetus if a pregnant person is infected with rubella. This includes: 21 Miscarriage Stillbirth Combinations of birth defects Asymptomatic infection of the baby The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control states that in 20 percent of cases where someone who is pregnant has rubella, they will miscarry , or the baby will die shortly after birth. 22 Since up to half of rubella cases do not show symptoms, a person may not know they have been infected.",
    "treatment": "There is no specific treatment for rubella, and symptoms tend to pass within 7 to 10 days. Bed rest is advised. 23 Ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen can be used to reduce a temperature and ease aching joints. 6 Drinking plenty of warming fluids can prevent dehydration and help symptoms like a sore throat. If any concerning symptoms develop, contact a doctor. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "preventing_rubella": "The best precaution against rubella is to be vaccinated against it. The World Health Organization credits vaccination with eliminating rubella and CRS from countries where it is routinely administered. Vaccines containing rubella provide protection in 95-100 percent of cases and usually remain effective for an entire lifetime. 20\n\nThe most common way to receive a rubella vaccination is with the MMR vaccine , which also immunizes against measles and mumps. Another vaccine, called MMRV, also immunizes against varicella, commonly known as chickenpox. 24 In countries with vaccination programs, children are given MMR at around 11-15 months , with a further dose between 2 and 6 years of age. 24 Each country, however, has its own vaccination program, meaning the age at which children are given the vaccine may differ slightly from country to country. Women who are considering becoming pregnant and are not sure if they are immune to rubella can be tested by their doctor. If necessary, they can be vaccinated with MMR before becoming pregnant. Despite some controversy in the 1990s, there is no evidence to suggest that the MMR vaccine causes autism . 25 26 27\n\nSomeone with rubella symptoms should stay away from work or school for at least seven days after the symptoms first appear to avoid infecting others. 12 It is important to tell other people who may have come into contact with someone who has rubella. This can include: Work colleagues School, daycare or nursery Anyone who is pregnant",
    "rubella_faqs": "Q: Is rubella contagious? A: Yes, rubella is caused by a moderately infectious virus. It is passed from person to person through the tiny droplets of moisture coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. The best way to protect against the rubella virus is through vaccination. Q: Are rubella and rubeola the same? A: No. Rubeola, more commonly known as measles, and rubella, also known as German measles, are different illnesses. They have some symptoms in common, such as: A rash on the skin Fever Cold-like symptoms, such as a cough and runny nose Conjunctivitis/pink eye They are also both prevented by the MMR vaccine. However, measles and rubella are caused by different viruses and have different specific symptoms and complications. 28 Q: How are rubella vaccines made? A: The rubella vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. It stimulates the immune system into producing antibodies that will protect someone against catching rubella in the future. Various manufacturers produce vaccines. Product information is available online in the United States on the FDA website for the MMR and MMRV vaccines. 29 30 NHS Choices has more information about the general ingredients in vaccines and more information specifically about MMR, including links to product information leaflets held on the electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC). 31 32 Q: What precautions should I take against rubella? A: The only way to prevent rubella is by having a vaccination. See the above section on Preventing rubella. Q: What are the side effects of the rubella vaccine? A: Side effects of the MMR vaccine can include: 33 34 Developing a very mild form of measles 7 to 11 days after the injection 1 in 50 children develop a mild form of mumps 3 to 4 weeks after the injection Some adult women may experience stiffness in the joints for several days Q: When can I get pregnant after the rubella vaccine? A: The CDC advises that you should not get pregnant for a month after having the MMR vaccine. 18 Q: What does the rubella rash look like? A: The rash associated with rubella is often the most noticeable symptom of the condition. The rash will typically develop one to five days after other symptoms and will be recognizable by: Pink, pinpoint bumps on a red, flat patch of skin Rash first appearing on the face, then spreading downwards towards the trunk and limbs Rash covers most of the body within 24 hours The rash tends to last three to five days."

    "overview": "Scabies is a skin infection caused by mites Scabies is highly contagious and can also spread in the early stages when you don’t experience any symptoms Scabies treatment is very effective and can consist of creams or oral medication\n\nScabies is a common condition caused by an infection with mites . It can cause an itchy rash, which can be treated with creams or oral medication. If left untreated, a scabies rash can last for a very long time, and you may also experience severe complications. In this guide by Ada’s medical team, you’ll find more information about scabies, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment options.",
    "what_is_scabies": "Scabies is a skin condition that affects about 200 million people worldwide at some point in their lives. It is an infestation of tiny mites that burrow into the skin and lay eggs. This leads to the development of scabies symptoms such as an itchy rash. Scabies can happen to anyone, but it mostly affects people in tropical areas where many people are living closely together without many resources. 1 2",
    "what_does_scabies_look_like": "The most common symptom which you may experience is a typical scabies rash which can be quite severe. A scabies rash is very itchy and can consist of lines and bumps which can occur anywhere on the body. Commonly affected areas are the space between the fingers, wrists, arms, legs, genitalia, and the scalp. The bumps can become inflamed and lead to skin sores. 1 People with compromised immune systems can develop a worse form of scabies which can be life-threatening. This is a severe infection called crusted scabies . This type of scabies can look different, as it can cause dry, scaly areas on the skin. This type of scabies rash can occur without the itchy sensation.",
    "what_causes_scabies": "Scabies are caused by mites . These mites burrow themselves into the top layer of your skin where they lay eggs. After 4 to 6 weeks, you develop an allergic reaction to the presence of the mites and their feces in your skin. This causes the symptoms of scabies. Scabies is very contagious, so after coming into contact with an infected person, the mites can easily transfer onto your skin. 1",
    "how_do_you_know_if_you_have_scabies": "Scabies can be identified by your healthcare provider by having a look at your skin and listening to the symptoms you’re experiencing. Sometimes a sample of your skin will be collected and placed under a microscope to detect traces of the mites. 1",
    "how_long_does_scabies_last": "Once you’ve come into contact with an infected person, the mites burrow themselves in the top layer of your skin and lay their eggs. After 3 to 4 days these eggs hatch, and after 1 to 2 weeks the mites are fully grown. It takes approximately 4 to 6 weeks for the body to develop an allergic reaction to the presence of the mites. Once scabies treatment is started, the mites die quite quickly and the itchy rash usually goes away after 2 weeks . Without treatment, however, the symptoms of scabies can persist for years. 1 3",
    "how_to_treat_scabies": "Scabies medication can exterminate the mites and relieve the symptoms of scabies. Most cases of scabies are treated with creams which need to be applied to the entire body. These creams should be applied for as long as your healthcare provider recommends, as new mites may still hatch from eggs that were still present in the skin. All members of the same household should be treate d, even if they are not experiencing any symptoms at the time. 1 3 In severe cases, your healthcare provider may prescribe you with Ivermectin, which is an oral medication for scabies.",
    "how_to_prevent_scabies": "In order to prevent the spread of scabies, it’s important to know that the mites causing scabies can survive for up to 2-3 days away from human skin . This means that you can get infected by coming into contact with the skin of an infected person, but also through contact with objects or clothing that the infected person touched during the past 2-3 days. In order to prevent scabies, you can: 1 3 Avoid skin-to-skin contact with infected people Wash and dry any clothing that has come into contact with an infected person on high temperature Place items used by the infected person that can’t be washed in a plastic bag for at least 3 days in order to eliminate the mites Clean objects and rooms where an infected person has been after treatment If you do get scabies, then it’s important to get treatment as soon as possible and to also treat other members of the same household in order to prevent the spread of the mites that cause scabies. 1",
    "possible_complications": "Untreated scabies can lead to a number of complications , especially in people with weakened immune systems. Some possible complications are: 1 3 Skin sores Bloodstream infections Heart disease Kidney disease ( post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis ) Impetigo Deterioration of eczema or psoriasis",
    "wrapping_up": "Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by the presence of mites in the skin. This condition is characterized by a rash that can be very itchy. With the appropriate treatment using topical creams or oral medication, the mites can be exterminated after which the itchy rash goes away too.",

    "scabies_faqs": "Q: How do you get scabies? A: You can get scabies by coming into contact with a person who is infected, or by touching objects that the infected person has touched. The mites that cause scabies can stay alive on objects for 2 to 3 days. Q: What does scabies look like on the skin? A: Scabies causes a rash that can be linear, or that can look like bumps on the skin. This rash usually occurs between the fingers, or on the arms, legs, genitalia, or scalp. Q: How to know if you have scabies? A: Your healthcare provider can provide you with a diagnosis by listening to your symptoms and performing a physical examination. Sometimes, a sample of your skin can also be checked for traces of the mites that cause scabies. Q: How do you get scabies without human contact? A: The mites that cause scabies can survive away from human skin for 2 to 3 days. This means that you can also get infected by touching objects that were used by an infected person, such as towels or clothing. Q: How to treat scabies at home? A: You can treat scabies at home with various scabies treatments that your healthcare provider can prescribe you with. In most cases, this will be a topical cream, although more severe cases may require oral medication."

    "what_is_schizophrenia": "Schizophrenia is a mental health disorder which affects the way a person thinks, feels, and behaves. This occurs as a result of disorganized or overactive brain activity. Schizophrenia tends to first occur during the teenage years or in early adulthood. The symptoms and severity of schizophrenia can vary widely from person to person , and often begin with subtle symptoms, such as withdrawing from social life and decreased motivation, as well as developing strange beliefs or hearing and seeing things that are not real. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Management is usually provided by an experienced team and involves medication and support. Early diagnosis and good management give the best chance of a full recovery.",
    "risks": "Schizophrenia occurs when there is a disturbance in the chemicals responsible for the brain's messaging system . The cause of schizophrenia is not well understood, but it's probable that several factors combine to cause this condition. This includes problems that occur during birth, the use of some drugs and experiencing stressful or traumatic events. There may be a genetic cause, as schizophrenia tends to run in families. Most people with schizophrenia will begin to have symptoms in their teenage years, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Schizophrenia can affect both men and women.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of schizophrenia can vary greatly from person to person. In the early stages, the symptoms are often frightening, and the affected person may not tell anyone that these are occurring. Generally speaking, there are two groups of symptoms in schizophrenia. The first type includes the better-known symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hearing, feeling, or seeing things that are not real, and having strange, strongly held beliefs. Other symptoms include speaking in an illogical, confused fashion, and acting erratically and disorganized. The less dramatic symptoms are possibly more common, though not as well known. These include avoiding social life, disorganized behavior, decreased motivation, a decrease in emotional response, and slowed thinking and movements. The symptoms of schizophrenia often interfere severely with everyday life.",
    "schizophrenia_and_covid_19": "COVID-19 can possibly increase the risk of schizophrenia due to the changes that it causes in the immune system. Schizophrenia also increases your risk of death due to an infection with the coronavirus.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made by an experienced doctor or psychiatrist based on the symptoms. Talking to people close to the affected person is also helpful in confirming the diagnosis. It is important to exclude other causes for the symptoms, and this may involve blood tests and scans of the head.",
    "treatment": "The management of schizophrenia takes place in a supportive team of health workers . It involves controlling the symptoms, and providing emotional and psychological support, and helping to get back to everyday life. People with symptoms of schizophrenia can be treated at home , or if the symptoms are very severe, in a hospital . Antipsychotic medications help to slow down the activity in the brain that produces the symptoms of schizophrenia. These may be tablets or injections and may be taken for 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis, or longer if needed. Supportive measures are very important and may include counseling, occupational therapy, and help from a social worker in managing the practical parts of life. These treatment measures should focus on the individual's abilities and aim for independent living. Early diagnosis and treatment give the best chance of a good recovery.",

It's believed to be autoimmune, meaning it's the result of the body's immune system attacking healthy tissues by mistake. The condition can affect anybody, but it most often affects middle-aged adults. It's a little more common in men than women. There have been only around 300 cases reported worldwide, mostly in Europe. The main symptom is a recurrent, non-itchy rash on the torso and limbs. This rash typically goes away within 1 day, but can come back often. Other symptoms may include a recurring fever, joint pain and inflammation, bone pain, and weakness. The symptoms are different from person to person. Exercise, stress, or temperature changes may trigger the symptoms. This condition may be suspected based on medical history and a physical exam. It's confirmed with lab tests. People with this condition have a higher level of immunoglobulin M, an immune system protein, in their blood. As this condition is very rare, it can take years before the correct diagnosis is made. The condition cannot be cured, and treatment aims to reduce the symptoms, Schnitzler syndrome does not seem to affect lifespan.

    "what_is_seasonal_affective_disorder": "Seasonal affective disorder, also known as SAD or seasonal depression, is a type of depression that occurs at the same time every year, usually beginning in fall and ending in spring. The condition is considered to be a subset of depression with a seasonal pattern, rather than a separate disorder. 1 2 Around 5 percent of the US population will experience seasonal depression each year. 2 However, statistics vary according to location. For example, just 1 percent of the population of Florida experience the condition, whereas 9 percent of people living in Alaska experience seasonal affective disorder. 3 In around 10 percent of people, seasonal affective disorder occurs during the summer months. Some people with bipolar disorder may also experience seasonal patterns to their condition. 4 Treatment can improve symptoms but many people will continue to experience the condition every year. Left untreated, symptoms can be debilitating. However, due to its seasonal nature, the onset of depression can be anticipated and preventive action taken. 5 4 If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder, try the Ada app for a free assessment.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms are broadly the same as for major depression, though specific to one season, including: Low mood most of the day, throughout the season Feeling hopeless Lacking in energy Changes in appetite and weight Difficulty concentrating Feeling hopeless, worthless or guilty Thoughts of suicide or death Read more about Signs of Depression » Symptoms specific to winter seasonal depression include: 1 6 7 Sadness Crying Hypersomnia, i.e.sleeping too much Lethargy Social withdrawal Tiredness Restlessness Cravings for carbohydrates Changing appetite Change in weight Symptoms of a rare form of SAD known as summer seasonal depression include: 1 6 Insomnia, i.e. not sleeping enough Agitation Restlessness Poor appetite Weight loss Anxiety If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing symptoms of seasonal affective disorder, try the Ada app for a free assessment.",
    "seasonal_affective_disorder_causes": "It is not entirely clear why some people experience depression that is connected to seasons, though there are some associated factors.\n\nIt is thought that there are associations between seasonal affective disorder and levels of certain subtances that affect the brain: Serotonin Melatonin Vitamin D\n\nPeople with seasonal affective disorder have problems regulating levels of serotonin in the brain, which is thought to be responsible for maintaining mood levels. A protein called SERT cancels the action of serotonin by transporting it out of the place of action quickly, and people with seasonal depression have more SERT in the winter months than during summer. Higher SERT levels are associated with lower serotonin levels, which is believed to cause depression. 3\n\nPeople with seasonal affective disorder may produce too much melatonin , which is a hormone that regulates sleep. The body produces more melatonin in the dark, so winter causes increased production, particularly in countries where there is little sunlight in winter. Too much melatonin in the body, combined with lower serotonin levels, can cause people to feel sleepier and can affect the body’s internal biological clock (circadian rhythms). Circadian rhythms are responsible for regulating people’s 24-hour cycles of waking and sleeping, and can also be influenced by temperature variations during seasons. 1 2 Read more about Melatonin\n\nPeople with seasonal affective disorder have been found to have lower-than-normal levels of vitamin D in their bodies. Low levels of vitamin D can be associated with not getting enough sunlight, though poor diet can also be a factor. There is no firm evidence that a lack of vitamin D causes seasonal depression, but there appears to be an associated link. 1 3 Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency » .\n\nApproximately one in 10 people with seasonal affective disorder experience symptoms of depression in summer. The reasons are unclear, but some psychiatrists believe that there are links to: 8 9 Disruption to everyday routines caused by summer vacations Extended daylight causing disruption to sleep schedules Summer heat, which some people can find oppressive Increase in socialising and more opportunities to consume alcohol Body image issues that may be more evident in hot weather because of more revealing clothing Financial concerns caused by social pressures to travel or socialize\n\nSome people are at a higher risk of developing seasonal affective disorder. These people include: 1 3 Women are four times as likely as men to develop SAD People with a family history of depression or who have depression or bipolar disorder themselves are more likely to be diagnosed with SAD SAD can affect people of any age, though it is more common in younger adults, aged 20-30 years old The farther away from the equator a person lives, the more likely they are to develop SAD",
    "diagnosis": "Seasonal affective disorder is no longer considered a disorder of its own by the DSM-5 10 , but as a type of depression with a seasonal pattern. To be diagnosed with seasonal depression, a person must: 6 Meet the criteria for being diagnosed with depression. For more information, see the resource on signs of depression. Have depressive episodes during particular seasons. Not experience depressive episodes during other seasons, or experience depression primarily during one season. Experience the pattern of seasonal depression for at least two years. Have experienced more seasonal depressive episodes than non-seasonal depressive episodes over the course of a lifetime. There is no medical or blood test to diagnose seasonal affective disorder. A doctor or other mental health practitioner will make a diagnosis based on dialogue, and interaction with the person affected and by listening to their primary symptoms, according to DSM-5 criteria. Other medical  tests and examinations might be performed to rule out other possible causes, including 7 Hypothyroidism Glandular fever Hypoglycemia episodes\n\nOne diagnostic test to identify whether a person has seasonal affective disorder is the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ). This is a quiz developed by a researcher working under the National Institute of Mental Health. The test is freely available to download here and does not require training to use. The SPAQ asks the person taking the test to rank their mood levels and activities, such as eating, sleeping and socializing, over the course of a year. 3 The Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire has been shown to measure results consistently from person to person and has been appropriately designed to measure symptoms of seasonal affective disorder. However, there is some doubt about the reliability of the SPAQ for the following reasons: 3 6 11 The test is taken retrospectively and people may not accurately recall their moods over the course of a year The questions may lead people to score themselves higher for seasonal depression than their symptoms justify There is doubt about the SPAQ’s test-retest reliability, which is how reliable the test is at providing consistent results over a period of time Symptom measurement is based on observation and is subjective, so may not be adequately captured by a scoring system For these reasons, the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire should not be the only tool used to predict how a person’s condition will progress over the years. The Ada app can also give a free symptom assessment.",
    "prevention": "Once a person becomes aware that they experience seasonal depression, it may be possible to plan ahead of time to prevent or lessen the severity of symptoms. This can include: 12 6 13 Starting medication, such as bupropion in early fall, or early spring for summer seasonal affective disorder. Starting light therapy in early fall by using a light therapy box. Read more about the treatment of seasonal affective disorder » Using behaviors learned in previous psychotherapy sessions, such as stress-relieving practices or reducing intake of carbohydrates. Taking exercise, particularly walking outside.",
    "treatment": "There are four main methods of treating seasonal affective disorder, which can be used alone or in combination.\n\nLight therapy, also known as phototherapy, is based on the idea that seasonal affective disorder is caused by lack of light during winter. People sit in front of a bright lamp or light box each day from early fall to late spring. This is thought to counteract the effects of lost daylight and reduce melatonin production. The lamps or light boxes used to treat seasonal depression contain light bulbs that emit very bright white fluorescent light, with no ultraviolet light. The light bulbs emit around 10,000 lux, 14 which is a similar level of illumination to daylight and around 20 times brighter than normal indoor lighting. ref1 12 A person with seasonal affective disorder should sit 12 to 18 inches away from the light box for 20 to 60 minutes each morning. The person must have their eyes open but is not required to look at the lamp, making it possible to do other activities at the same time, such as have breakfast or read. The clinical effectiveness of light box therapy for seasonal affective disorder is not yet established. 15 However, many people report benefits, and the treatment has relatively few side effects. Some side effects of using light boxes can include: 3 Eye strain Headaches Irritability Difficulty sleeping after exposure to light, which is why use is recommended for mornings Rarer side effects can include: Hypomania Suicidal thoughts Nausea Irritability or agitation Hyperactivity Could trigger migraines Light boxes should not be used by people who: 3 Take medications which increase sensitivity to light, such as lithium, melatonin, phenothiazine antipsychotics and some antibiotics Have retinal disease Are at risk of age-related macular degeneration Have a condition that makes skin especially sensitive to light, such as systemic lupus erythematosus Suffer sensitivity to light  in general Improvements in people undergoing light box therapy treatment are generally observed within one or two weeks. Treatment should be continued until spring to avoid relapse. Some people may find it difficult to dedicate the time needed to commit to light box therapy over the course of the changing seasons. 12 4 Light boxes and lamps can be expensive to buy, but some insurance policies recognize the benefits of light box therapy for seasonal affective disorder. Light box therapy is a medical procedure and should only be used with the guidance of a health professional. 6\n\nSome people find a dawn simulator preferable to light box therapy to treat seasonal affective disorder. Dawn simulators are lamps, often attached to alarm clocks, which gradually increase in brightness to simulate the effect of a sunrise. A small study found dawn simulators to be as effective as light box therapy in reducing symptoms of depression. Some people may find dawn simulators a more convenient light therapy option when compared to light boxes, as treatment is mainly administered while asleep. 16\n\nSeasonal affective disorder can be treated with antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine. SSRIs have been found to be as effective in treating seasonal depression as light box therapy. 3 The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of bupropion to treat seasonal affective disorder. Bupropion is another type of SSRI antidepressant. It may take four to five weeks to feel the effects of SSRIs. If medication is effective, it should be taken continuously until the season changes. 4 People taking fluoxetine and bupropion can experience side effects. A doctor will be able to advise on how to manage them.\n\nForms of psychotherapy and counselling can be helpful to people with seasonal affective disorder whose symptoms are not severe. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be effective by helping people think differently about their seasonal depression. New ways of approaching the condition include: 3 4 Eating more healthily and eating fewer carbohydrates Engaging in an exercise routine Practising good sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a cool, dark room and not being disturbed by electronic equipment Practising yoga, mindfulness and other stress management techniques Spending time with friends and family Doing activities the person finds pleasurable Spending time outdoors Counseling can produce long-term benefits from one course of therapy, which is generally one or two sessions a week for six weeks. This compares favourably to treatments such as medication and light box therapy, which need to be repeated each season. 17\n\nLow levels of vitamin D are associated with seasonal affective disorder. It is thought that vitamin D supplements may help relieve symptoms of the condition. 1 Evidence for effectiveness is currently mixed, but there is the suggestion that taking vitamin D supplements before the onset of winter could help prevent, or lessen, the severity of seasonal depression symptoms. 3\n\nBecause the causes of summer seasonal affective disorder are thought to be different to those of people affected in winter, treatments such as light box therapy and vitamin D are unlikely to be effective. However, effective treatment may include some of the following: 9 4 However, medication with antidepressants is thought to alleviate symptoms. Psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy can help to build awareness of trigger points and develop coping strategies, such as getting enough sleep. Limiting the amount of daylight a person receives and staying cool is also thought to help reduce the severity of symptoms.",
    "faqs": "Q: Is seasonal affective disorder real? A: Seasonal affective disorder is real. There are people whose depression recurs in connection with a particular season. The reason is thought to be linked to fluctuations in serotonin and melatonin levels over the year. Read more about the causes of seasonal affective disorder » Q: Is seasonal affective disorder a bipolar variant? A: Seasonal affective disorder is not a variant of bipolar disorder. When a person has bipolar disorder, their moods swing from highs of mania and hypomania to lows of depression. Sometimes those episodes may occur at specific times of the year. People with seasonal affective disorder experience only depression at a specific time of year. Q: Do SAD light boxes work? A: Light boxes to treat seasonal affective disorder work by using bulbs which emit a very bright light; the person sits close to the box for 20 to 60 minutes each morning. Some people report that their depression symptoms are improved by using a light box, and light therapy is a recognized treatment for SAD. However, the scientific evidence for clinical effectiveness is not yet established.",

    "condition": "Secondary Syphilis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/secondary-syphilis/",
    "what_is_syphilis": "Venereal syphilis, commonly known as simply “syphilis”, is an infection caused by the bacteria  Treponema pallidum (subspecies pallidum). Syphilis is spread by direct contact with an infected individual, such as: 1 2 3 Sexual contact From mother to fetus in utero Via blood transfusions Contact with a syphilis sore in a non-genital region (although this is rare) Needle sharing amongst injecting drug users\n\nIt can be spread by any sexual activity, making it a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Syphilis can be spread by oral sex, anal sex and vaginal sex, as well as any other genital contact and sharing of sex toys. Sharing food and drinks, towels and toilet seats with people who have syphilis is considered safe, as is hugging, holding hands, coughing and sneezing. 4 It is possible for syphilis to be spread by kissing if the infected individual has a syphilis sore in the mouth, however, this is rare. It is also possible for mothers to transmit syphilis to their babies in utero. This is known as congenital syphilis. Other treponemal diseases caused by Treponema pallidum are related to syphilis but are not spread by sexual contact. These include yaws (caused by subspecies pertenue), bejel (subspecies endemicum), and pinta (caused by subspecies carateum,) which all affect the skin or bones. 5 6 Syphilis used to be much more common than it is today, but after the introduction of treatment with the antibiotic penicillin after World War Two, the number of people with syphilis dropped globally. However, since the beginning of the twenty-first century,  the incidence (how many people are newly reported as having syphilis) is rising in the West, mostly due to unsafe sexual practices. Currently, there are about 10.6 million cases of syphilis worldwide. 7 Syphilis is a concern among all groups, as it is a major risk factor for passing on HIV. The incidence of syphilis is rising most sharply among men who have sex with men (MSM): between 2015 and 2016, the reported number of cases of syphilis rose 18% in the UK, and more than half of these cases were among men who have sex with men. In the USA, according to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately half of men who have sex with men who have syphilis are also HIV-positive, and men who are HIV-negative but do have syphilis are more likely to contract HIV in the future. 8 This is generally believed to be the result of higher rates of unprotected sexual practice in this group, rather than the type of sexual activity  itself. Unprotected sexual contact is inadvisable regardless of sexual orientation.",
    "the_stages": "Syphilis has four stages: 7 Primary syphilis is the initial stage of infection, in which a flat, painless ulcer develops at the site of infection. This ulcer is called a chancre. 1 It usually appears between 10 and 90 days after contact with an infected individual, and heals on its own after two to twelve weeks (although the affected person remains infectious). 3 . Secondary syphilis follows two to ten weeks after primary syphilis. It has many symptoms, including a distinctive rash. The rash is usually at its worst between three and four months after infection. 3 This phase can last between one and six months. Latent syphilis , early and late. In early latent syphilis, the infected person is asymptomatic (has no symptoms) but is still infectious. In late latent syphilis, the person is less infectious. The latent phase may last for up to 25 years in some cases, although not all individuals will have a latent stage. 3 Tertiary syphilis can occur from 3 to 15 years after the initial infection, and is when the affected individual develops complications from long term infection. The complications can include severe neurological and cardiovascular effects . In this stage soft, rounded tumor-like areas of inflammation called gummas can also appear. 7",
    "what_is_secondary_syphilis": "Secondary syphilis appears only after the symptoms of primary syphilis have passed, usually around two to ten weeks after the primary chancre has appeared. About one in four people who have untreated primary syphilis will develop secondary syphilis. In secondary syphilis, the affected person experiences a generalized infection. This secondary phase, if left untreated, lasts for up to six months, with symptoms recurring during that period. Without treatment, the symptoms will, in most cases, resolve spontaneously, but the infected person will then progress into the latent or tertiary phase of the disease.",
    "secondary_syphilis_symptoms": "Secondary syphilis is a generalized infection affecting the entire body, so it has a number of possible symptoms. People with syphilis may show some or all of these. Common symptoms include: 1 4 9 7 3 10 A painless, non-itchy rash, which is generally bilaterally symmetrical (the same on both sides) Swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin Headaches Malaise, aches, and pains A mild fever Loss of appetite Nausea Sore throat Neck stiffness The rash is the most distinctive symptom of secondary syphilis. It can take many forms, including: 9 7 A red or pink skin rash, turning reddish-brown. This rash may be very faint. It can occur on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and on the face. In some cases this rash may spread to cover the entire body. It is generally not itchy. Flat, soft growths around moist, warm areas of the body, such as the vagina and anus. These are known as condylomata lata and are sometimes confused with genital warts . They may be pink or grey. These growths are not painful or itchy and often disappear spontaneously. They may also occur on other mucus membranes. 9 7 White patches on the roof of the mouth and the tongue. Less common symptoms of secondary syphilis include: 9 7 Weight loss Patchy alopecia (hair loss) Kidney problems (such as glomerulonephritis) Meningitis Hepatitis Splenomegaly (an enlarged spleen) Cranial nerve palsies (weakness or paralysis of nerves in the head and face. These can cause various problems, for example, double vision) Periostitis (inflammation of membranes around bones) Anterior uveitis (inflammation inside the middle layer of the eye)",
    "diagnosing_secondary_syphilis": "The process of diagnosing secondary syphilis will typically include taking the person’s medical history to assess whether they have been at risk of infection, as well as examining any physical symptoms they are showing. However, laboratory tests are the only way to be sure whether or not a person has acquired the infection. Situations in which tests are especially necessary include: 9 If the affected person thinks they may have symptoms If they have recently had unprotected sex with a new partner If they or their partner have had unprotected sex with other partners If they have another STI, for example, gonorrhea or chlamydia If they are HIV-positive. If their partner has disclosed that they have an STI If they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant If the affected person is a man who has sex with men If they have previously had syphilis It is important to test as soon as possible. However, as syphilis does not always show up in results if the infection is very recent, re-testing at a later date may be necessary. Even people who are asymptomatic should be tested if they have been at high risk of having acquired or passed on syphilis. Infected people should also be tested for HIV, and ideally a full STI panel, where tests are done for a range of STIs, should be ordered as well.\n\nThere are a number of laboratory tests for syphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis is usually made by taking a blood test to screen for the disease, followed by another test or tests to confirm its presence. Tests are done on blood as well as body fluids. The most important screening tests are: 11 Venereal disease laboratory test (VDRL) including an Immunoglobulin M (IgM) test Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA) To confirm the presence of syphilis, a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (FTA-abs) may be administered. This test, and the tests listed above, all work by detecting antibodies - particles produced by the body’s immune system in response to syphilis infection. The exact tests used and the order they are used in depends on the laboratory. Self-test kits are available , but are not very accurate. It is advisable to seek assistance from a sexual health clinic, hospital or doctor’s office.",
    "treatment": "Syphilis is easily treated using the antibiotic penicillin. Primary, secondary and latent syphilis can all be treated with penicillin, but it is most effective in the primary and secondary phases. 7 Latent syphilis infection can be cured by penicillin, but any organ damage already sustained from longterm infection cannot be undone The same is true of tertiary syphilis. In patients who are allergic to penicillin, doxycycline and ceftriaxone may be used. Because of increasing antibiotic resistance, azithromycin is no longer very effective. Treatment does not prevent future re-infection. It is very important that people receiving treatment for syphilis adhere to their treatment regime and abstain from unprotected sexual activity. 1 When treating syphilis, most physicians prefer to use parenteral (administered by injection) treatment rather than oral treatment, as injecting medication tends to happen under medical supervision, which may mean that the patient has a better chance of adhering to the treatment regime. The first line of treatment for syphilis is an intramuscular (into the muscle) injection of a single dose of of benzathine penicillin. An alternative treatment is Doxycycline, for patients who are allergic to penicillin 7 . Improvement is experienced shortly after treatment begins, but the time to complete recovery varies according to how long the infection has been present. Follow-up blood tests are required to check if the treatment has been effective.\n\nBetween half and three-quarters of people  being treated with antibiotics for syphilis have an unpleasant set of short-term symptoms known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which occurs several hours after beginning treatment. 3 As the treponemal bacteria die they release inflammatory substances, and these are responsible for the body’s reaction. 7 12 Symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, headache and rapid heartbeat. People suffering from this reaction can take aspirin or ibuprofen, and should not be left alone in case complications develop, such as panic attacks, faintness, etc. If complications do develop, seek medical help.The condition usually passes within 24 hours, and it not usually considered to be dangerous.",
    "preventing_secondary_syphilis": "Using a condom can significantly reduce the risk of passing on or catching syphilis from a sexual partner. Since the bacteria responsible for syphilis are transferred through skin abrasions or infected mucous membranes, barrier protection is an effective method of preventing transmission . In primary syphilis, it is important to cover the chancre (the small, painless genital ulcer) with a condom or dental dam if engaging in sexual activity. 8 Additionally, users of intravenous drugs should not share needles.",
    "other_names_for_secondary_syphilis": "Lues secondary state Secondary lues venerea Secondary syphilis infection",
    "secondary_syphilis_faqs": "Q: Can one contract syphilis from sharing sex toys? A: Yes. If one’s sexual partner has syphilis and they share sex toys, one may contract syphilis. The risk of this can be reduced by using condoms on sex toys, with a new condom for each partner, and cleaning the toys thoroughly between uses, using soap and water or a dedicated toy cleaning solution. 1 Using the correct type of lubricant is important to toy hygiene, as using the incorrect type will cause damage to the toy’s surface, making it more difficult to clean. Manufacturers usually advise about the correct cleaning and lubrication procedures for their toys. Q: Should people who are asymptomatic but suspect they may have syphilis seek testing? A: If you think you have been exposed to syphilis through a sexual or intimate partner, but do not have symptoms, it is highly recommended that you are tested. Some people with syphilis show no symptoms, and their infection is only discovered during routine STI screening. 11 Testing is important if you might fall pregnant, or have multiple sexual partners. Q: Can I have secondary syphilis without having had primary syphilis? A: No. The infection is sequential, so everyone with secondary syphilis has had primary syphilis, although it may have been asymptomatic. However, if you seek treatment for secondary syphilis and the treatment is successful, you will not develop latent or tertiary syphilis unless you contract syphilis again."

    "condition": "Sepsis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/sepsis/",
    "what_is_sepsis": "Sepsis is a whole-body response to an infection in the blood. This severe condition is also known as blood poisoning, or septicemia. Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads from one location, for example, the lungs, the bladder or the skin, into the blood. Usually, when an infection is present in the body, it is limited to the system or area it affects, for example, a urinary tract infection usually does not spread beyond the urinary tract. Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads throughout the body, prompting a full-body, or systemic, response. 1 The risk of sepsis increases if the infection is left untreated or is not adequately treated. 2\n\nSepsis can be caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Most cases of sepsis are the result of bacterial infection. As a result, sepsis can be defined as a full-body response to bacteremia, which is the presence ofbacteria in the blood. 1 Elderly people and people with other medical conditions are at higher risk of getting sepsis than the general population. The main symptoms include fever, chills, confusion, rapid pulse and drowsiness. Sepsis needs to be treated urgently in a hospital and is treated with antibiotics and fluids.\n\nThe term septicemia is often used as a synonym for sepsis, but medically speaking, they are separate, though related, conditions. Technically, septicemia is an infection of the blood, while sepsis affects the body as a whole. 3 Sepsis has also been known as SIRS, or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome, but this term is now considered to be out of date. 4 Septic shock is a type of sepsis associated with abnormalities of the circulatory system, cell function and metabolic processes. Septic shock is associated with higher mortality rates than sepsis. In septic shock, multiple organ failure can occur. The lungs, kidneys and liver may be affected. It is often caused by bacterial infections acquired in hospital. 5",
    "sepsis_symptoms": "Symptoms of sepsis include: Fever or feeling cold Chills A strong feeling of illness Drowsiness Fast pulse Fast breathing Confusion As the sepsis gets worse, people may have very cold and blue hands and feet, urinate less and lose consciousness altogether. There may  also be signs of the underlying infection. These signs can vary greatly, depending on factors, including where the infection has begun and what kind of infectious agents it is caused by, and can include: 4 Abdominal pain Coughing An abscess Jaundice Painful urination\n\nThe common symptoms of sepsis are: 4 5 6 Fever, defined as a body temperature of above 38 C / 100.4 F, with or without chills Low body temperature, usually defined as below 36 C / 96.8 F Cold extremities, which may also be bluish or mottled Sweating Rapid breathing Rapid heartbeat Mental confusion, grogginess, lack of alertness, or unresponsiveness Cold and warm shock In warm shock, the skin becomes warms and the heart rate increases. This is due to increased cardiac output making the arteries dilate, increasing blood pressure. In cold shock, which follows, the cardiac output decreases. Correspondingly, the blood pressure drops, and the skin becomes chill, mottled, pale, bluish and/or clammy.\n\nThe symptoms of sepsis can be different in children. It is important to remember that young children may not be able to tell caregivers whether they feel ill or how ill they feel. Children, toddlers and infants with sepsis may: 3 Feel unusually cold to the touch Have blotchy, blue, pallid and/or clammy skin Have a rash that does not fade when pressed Breathe rapidly Be unwilling to eat or take feeds Vomit or complain of nausea Produce very little or no urine Be difficult to wake up or rouse If you are at all concerned that your infant or a child in your care may have sepsis, it is best to take them to a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nNewborn babies are vulnerable to neonatal sepsis, a condition which results from an infection occurring during the early days of life. 7 Neonatal sepsis usually results from a bacterial infection. There are two main types of neonatal sepsis: 8 Early onset neonatal sepsis, which occurs within the first three days of life and is usually the result of an infection picked up from the infant’s mother during or before birth. Symptoms of early onset neonatal sepsis can appear within six hours of birth. Late onset neonatal sepsis, which occurs between the ages of four days and three months, is usually the result of an infection picked up from the environment, such as the clinic or hospital. 8\n\nFactors that increase a baby’s risk of developing early-onset neonatal sepsis include: 7 A Group B streptococcal infection in the mother Preterm delivery The mother’s waters breaking more than 18 hours before the baby is born Chorioamnionitis, an infection of the placenta and amniotic fluid Factors that increase a baby’s risk of late onset neonatal sepsis include: 8 A long stay in hospital after birth A catheter or in-dwelling IV line Use of antibiotics\n\nThe signs of neonatal sepsis are not always very obvious, and caregivers of at-risk babies should be vigilant. Symptoms of neonatal sepsis include: 7 8 Lethargy, or less activity than usual Reluctance to suckle, or loss of interest in suckling Loss of appetite Apnea, a temporary pause in breathing Slow heartbeat Fever or low body temperature Changes in bowel movements, for example, diarrhea or constipation Seizures Vomiting Jaundice",
    "risk_factors_and_causes": "Elderly people are at higher risk of developing sepsis, though it can affect people of every age. People with some medical conditions, such as cancer , a weakened immune system or diabetes , are at increased risk of this condition. Sepsis occurs when an infection spreads from a particular location into the blood; for example, from the lungs, the bladder or the skin. This causes a whole-body response, as the immune system tries to fight the infection. Some groups of people are at higher risk of developing sepsis than others. These groups include: 3 4 People older than 75 years of age or children younger than one year of age People who have diabetes mellitus People who have recently had surgery or invasive medical procedures People who have recently sustained severe burns People who have in-dwelling IV lines or catheters People who take high doses of steroids Users of intravenous recreational drugs People who use excessive alcohol People who have cirrhosis of the liver People with weakened immune systems, for example as a result of HIV infection or chemotherapy Pregnant women\n\nSepsis arises following an infection or injury to the body. The gastrointestinal tract, the genitourinary tract, soft tissue, the skin, the pelvic area and the the respiratory system are all common sites of infections that can progress to sepsis. 4 6 There are many conditions affecting the renal and genitourinary systems , which can lead to sepsis. These include: 6 Pyelonephritis Kidney abscess Urinary tract obstructions Urinary tract infections Kidney stones Bacterial prostatitis Prostate abscess Pelvic abscess Pelvic inflammatory disease\n\nConditions affecting the gastrointestinal system , which can lead to sepsis include: 6 Disorders of the colon, such as inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulitis or Crohn’s disease Intestinal obstruction Appendicitis Gastroenteritis Gastritis Peritonitis Conditions affecting the respiratory system , which can lead to sepsis include: 6 Pneumonia Pleural empyema, a condition in which a bacterial infection causes pus to collect in between the pleural membranes that surround the lungs Lung abscess Influenza Conditions affecting other systems and structures in the body, which can lead to sepsis include: 6 Liver disease Gallbladder disease Infective endocarditis Dental abscess Severe burns Cutaneous/skin abscess Cellulitis Bacterial meningitis\n\nIn addition, some medical procedures and devices can increase the risk of developing sepsis: 3 6 9 Open surgery Prosthetic heart valves Long-term catheters Long-term intravenous lines Breathing tubes and intubation Recent use of antibiotics Recent use of high-dose steroids Chemotherapy\n\nNot all bacteria can cause sepsis. The species of bacteria most commonly responsible for sepsis include: 6 10 11 12 Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Group B streptococcus Staphylococcus pyogenes Klebsiella Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nWhen someone with suspected sepsis is examined by a doctor, the exact strain of bacteria responsible for their sepsis may not be known. The first line of treatment , therefore, is to administer a broad-spectrum antibiotic. For more information, see the section on treatment.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is often made from the appearance and physical examination of the affected person. Blood tests are taken to prove that an infection is the cause of the symptoms, to check the function of organs that might be affected by sepsis and to identify the cause of sepsis. Sepsis screening is an important part of the diagnostic process.\n\nThe SOFA score is used to determine how severely ill a person affected by sepsis is and assesses the risk of mortality. The SOFA score is determined by measuring organ function in the respiratory, cardiovascular, liver, kidney and neurological systems, as well as blood coagulation. As parts of the SOFA system require sending blood samples to a laboratory for testing, it is not very fast, and so the qSOFA is now used to make initial diagnoses instead.\n\nThe qSOFA, or quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment, is used to determine the presence and severity of sepsis. It is a quicker, simpler version of the SOFA criteria. The qSOFA can be carried out at the affected person’s bedside and uses three criteria: 13 Altered mental state Low blood pressure, defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm/Hg High respiratory rate, of 22 or more breaths a minute The physician carrying out the qSOFA assessment assigns points according to the results of examinations of the affected person’s respiration, blood pressure, and mental state. If all three criteria are met, sepsis is present. 5 Both SOFA and qSOFA tests have to be carried out by trained medical professionals in a medical setting.\n\nBlood tests and bacterial cultures are an important part of diagnosing sepsis. Blood tests that are usually carried out include: 6 A complete blood count to identify clotting abnormalities and count the white blood cell levels Laboratory cultures of the blood, to determine which bacterial species isbacteria are responsible for the sepsis and thereby guide antibiotic therapy. Sometimes cultures are also carried out using samples of pus, nasal mucus, urine or phlegm, depending on the type of suspected underlying infection. Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nIn cases where an abscess or localised infection is suspected to be the cause of sepsis, imaging studies may be carried out to aid diagnosis and treatment. Imaging tests commonly carried out during the diagnosis of sepsis include: 6 Chest X-rays to identify pneumonia or lung disorders Abdominal ultrasound Computed tomography (CT) scan Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)",
    "treatment": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition which must be treated in a hospital. The key to successfully treating sepsis is to diagnose it as early as possible and thereafter to begin aggressive antibiotic and supportive treatment as soon as possible. Sepsis is treated by giving antibiotics against the cause of the infection and fluids to increase blood pressure. The cause of the original infection should be identified and treated, or removed.\n\nMost people with sepsis will require hospitalization, and people who are severely affected may need to be treated in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Upon being admitted to hospital, the affected person will be given oxygen, breathing support, and vasopressors and fluids to support blood pressure and organ function. 4 In some cases, intravenous insulin may also be given to support blood glucose levels.  While hospitalized, the affected person will be tested for inflammation markers, often several times a day, to monitor their condition. The duration of the stay in hospital will depend on the severity of the sepsis, the effectiveness of the treatment and the management of the underlying condition.\n\nBecause most cases of sepsis are the result of a severe bacterial infection, antibiotic treatment is one of the first lines of treatment against the disorder. Initial treatment with antibiotics is begun even before the pathogen responsible is identified, using a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Thereafter, the treatment will be adjusted according to what laboratory cultures identify as the cause of the infection. 6\n\nIf the sepsis has been identified as the result of an abscess, burns or an infected surgical incision or wound, surgical procedures may be needed to remove the source. In the case of an abscess, the abscess will need to be surgically drained. In other cases, such as burns or infected wounds, the affected tissue may need to be removed, along with any foreign objects.",
    "complications_and_long_term_prognosis": "Sepsis is a serious condition that needs to be treated promptly and aggressively to ensure a good outcome. There are several complications associated with sepsis, as well as a number of long-term effects which may impact the quality of life of people who have had the condition.\n\nWaterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome is a rare complication, a condition in which the adrenal glands fail due to bleeding. The syndrome causes bleeding inside the adrenal glands and, because of the damage to the adrenal glands this causes, to adrenal insufficiency. Symptoms include: 14 15 A rash, beginning as small pink patches or swellings that resemble pimples, which later expand into larger purple patches Malaise and weakness Dizziness Cough Joint and muscle pain Fever Rigors/chills Nausea and vomiting Headache Low blood pressure Fast heart rate\n\nWaterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome is a medical emergency, and anyone who shows symptoms of the syndrome should receive medical care immediately.\n\nSepsis can disturb the processes that control the blood’s clotting. As a result, disseminated intravascular coagulation can occu, and may be serious. In this condition, blood clots form throughout the body, and, as the chemicals that help blood to clot become depleted, bleeding occurs. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and organ failure. 16\n\nSepsis, because of its severity and the effects it has throughout the body, can cause after-effects of various kinds. These include: 17 18 Post-traumatic stress disorder Amputations Rehospitalization due to infection Relapse of sepsis Cognitive problems such as confusion Cardiovascular problems Muscle and joint pain Insomnia and nightmares, or other sleep disorders Anxiety and depression Together, these make up post-sepsis syndrome, a condition which affects almost 50% of all sepsis survivors, particularly if they are older adults. People who were admitted to an ICU with sepsis may be more likely to have post-sepsis syndrome.",
    "prevention": "It is important that infections, such as pneumonia, bladder infections or skin infections, are assessed early by a doctor and treated with antibiotics. People who are at increased risk of vaccine-preventable infections, such as the elderly and people with other medical conditions, should make sure they keep their vaccinations up to date.",
    "sepsis_faqs": "Q: Is sepsis fatal? A: Sepsis can be fatal. It is one of the most common causes of death among hospitalized people. 19 However, improvements in care have reduced mortality rates in recent decades, and early detection and prompt appropriate treatment further improves the outcome. Q: Is sepsis contagious? A: No, sepsis is not contagious - it cannot spread from person to person. However, the underlying infection that has caused the sepsis may be contagious. 20 Q: Can sepsis cause red streaks on the skin? A: Red streaks on the skin spreading from the site of an infected wound are a sign that the infection has spread to the lymph vessels. Red streaks are not a sign of sepsis itself, but can indicate that a skin infection such as erysipelas or cellulitis has begun in the affected area. 21 If left untreated, both erysipelas, which affects the upper layers of the skin, and cellulitis, which affect deeper layers of tissue, can potentially lead to sepsis. 22 Q: Can sepsis cause a skin rash? A: Yes, it can. Some people with sepsis develop a hemorrhagic rash, which in its early stages looks like a cluster of small red dots, but can develop into larger spots that resemble bruises. 23 Q: What is toxic shock syndrome and how does it differ from sepsis? A: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a disorder caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and/or Group A Staphylococcus. Toxic shock syndrome can lead to sepsis. It often results from infections affecting the skin, surgical wounds, abscesses, and sinus and bone infection. 24 Toxic shock syndrome has a sudden onset and can quickly become medically serious. TSS is potentially life-threatening and should be considered a medical emergency. The symptoms of TSS include: 25 Fever of 38.8 C / 102 F or higher Pain Rapid, sudden drop in blood pressure Confusion Fainting Headache Diarrhea and vomiting Low or no urine output Fatigue and weakness Difficulty breathing Rash Q: What is Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome? A: SIRS is a concept used to determine whether an affected person has sepsis, not a separate condition. An affected person is considered to have sepsis if they meet two or more of the SIRS criteria, which are: 26 Fever of 38 C / 100.4 F  or more Hypothermia of 36 C / 96.8 F or less A pulse of more than 90 beats a minute Rapid breathing, of more than 20 breaths a minute An increase or decrease in the number of white blood cells in the blood, determined using a blood tests In recent years,  the medical communities have moved away from using it because it is no longer considered to be sufficiently sensitive or accurate. Most medical practitioners now use the qSOFA Score system to determine whether sepsis is present. Q: Can influenza cause sepsis? A: Although most cases of sepsis are the result of bacterial infection, it is possible for a viral infection to lead to sepsis. Influenza is a viral infection. However, it is rare for influenza itself to cause sepsis."

    "condition": "Septic Arthritis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/septic-arthritis/",
    "what_is_septic_arthritis": "Septic arthritis, also known as infectious arthritis or pyogenic arthritis, is a very rare condition involving an inflammation of a joint caused by an infection in that joint. It is usually caused by bacteria, though it may be caused by other microorganisms. Incidence is about 6 per 100,000 of the population in any given year. 1 The condition can affect anyone, but those with underlying joint disease or prosthetic joints have an increased risk, as well as older people and those with diabetes or a weakened immune system. Any joint may be affected, but septic arthritis is most common in the knee and hip, sometimes also occurring in the shoulder, elbow and ankle. 2 Symptoms usually develop quickly, over a few hours or days, and include pain, redness, swelling, heat and difficulty moving the affected joint or joints. Many people will develop a fever. If the infection spreads, a person may also develop nausea, dizziness or drowsiness. Septic arthritis occurs when infectious microorganisms reach the inside of the joints. This can occur indirectly, if the microorganism enters the body via, such as a wound, and travels through the bloodstream to a joint, or directly, by entering a joint as a result of injury, injection or surgery. A diagnosis is confirmed when a fluid sample from the affected joint shows that bacteria or other infectious agents are present. 2 Septic arthritis is treated with antibiotics delivered into a vein, normally during a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home. Fluid may also be drawn from the infected joint using a needle and syringe. 3 Septic arthritis normally occurs in just one joint, but polyarticular arthritis, in which multiple joints throughout the body are infected, is also possible. 4 Good to know: It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The condition can rapidly cause irreversible joint damage and, if left untreated, can be life-threatening. However, with prompt treatment, most people will recover well. 5 Read more about Arthritis »",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptoms of septic arthritis are localized to the affected joint as a result of inflammation and include: 6 7 Redness of the overlying skin Swelling Pain Stiffness and difficulty moving Heat Inability to bear weight Many people will also feel generally unwell, with symptoms that may include: 8 9 Fever Nausea Vomiting Dizziness Drowsiness In most people with septic arthritis, the onset of symptoms occurs very quickly, within a few hours or days. In about half of cases, the knee is affected. 6 Other commonly affected joints include the hip, shoulder, elbow, ankle and, in the case of intravenous drug users, the sternoclavicular joint between the collarbone and breastbone. The condition may occur as polyarticular arthritis, in which multiple joints are affected. It is very important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected. The Ada app can also give you an initial symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Septic arthritis is caused by bacteria or other microorganisms entering the joint, most commonly entering the joints via the bloodstream, 10 for instance from a distant site such as a wound infection or a widespread infection, such as gonorrhea . Bacteria may also enter a joint directly, such as through joint replacement surgery, injection or penetrating trauma. 2 Infection causes damage to the joint. This may be a direct result of the infecting microorganism, such as Staphylococcus aureus, or a result of the affected person’s immune response. As soon as bacteria invade the bloodstream, the body begins an immune response. White blood cells and joint lining cells may attempt to surround and digest the bacteria. The chemical signals sent out by these cells contribute to the characteristic inflammation of septic arthritis, which can cause destruction of cartilage. Depending on the infecting organism, the level of inflammatory response and joint destruction varies. For example, infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is known as gonococcal arthritis and is caused by the bacteria responsible for gonorrhea, induces a relatively mild inflammatory response. 10 Septic arthritis may occur in connection with a prosthetic joint replacement. Prosthetic implant infection may enter the joint during the joint replacement procedure. Bacteria may also enter the bloodstream at another site and travel to the joint, which may be more susceptible to infection as it heals. 10",
    "risk_factors": "Risk factors for developing septic arthritis include: 6 11 Age 80 or above: 45 percent of those affected are older than 65 A prosthetic implant, such as an artificial knee or hip, or other recent joint surgery Diabetes Prior joint damage, particularly from rheumatoid arthritis or gout Liver cirrhosis: liver scarring due to conditions such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism HIV and AIDS or otherwise compromised immune system A recent blood infection Intravenous drug use Gonorrhea infection A bone infection, which is also called osteomyelitis, near to a joint Good to know: People with diabetes and weakened immune systems should seek prompt treatment for all infections, including urinary tract infections and skin infections.",
    "diagnosis": "If a doctor suspects septic arthritis, they will immediately refer a person to the nearest emergency department for an assessment. The diagnosis is confirmed when a sample of fluid from the joints reveals the presence of bacteria or other microorganisms. Further diagnostic testing may include blood tests, an ultrasound, an X-ray, a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the joints.\n\nIt is important that a person describe any joint pain and other symptoms, as well as how long they have been going on for. A doctor will look for signs of septic arthritis, such as swollen, tender, warm joints with painful or limited movement and fever.\n\nAfter referral to the emergency department, one or more tests may be done to help make a diagnosis. These include: 7 5 A blood test: This may reveal an elevated white blood cell count, which is normally found in cases of septic arthritis. Abnormally high levels of certain markers in the blood would also support a diagnosis that symptoms are caused by an inflammatory condition, such as septic arthritis. Inflammatory markers which may be detected by a blood test include: 6 2 C-reactive protein (CRP) Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) Blood cultures to detect bacteria in the blood However, these tests come back normal in many cases of septic arthritis, so cannot be relied upon to rule out the condition. Read more about Blood Test Results » Synovial fluid analysis: Joint fluid is drawn using a needle in a process known as arthrocentesis or joint aspiration. It is then examined for the presence of infection to confirm diagnosis. Joint fluid analysis can also usually identify any organism found, which may influence treatment options.\n\nA doctor may also recommend an X-ray, CT scan, ultrasound or MRI scan of the affected joint. This can help with diagnosis of septic arthritis and any complications. However, at an early stage of septic arthritis, there may not be any visible joint damage. 12",
    "septic_arthritis_treatment": "There are five main aspects of septic arthritis treatment: 2 13 Antibiotics: Septic arthritis infection must be cleared with antibiotics delivered into a vein Draining the joint: This may be done to clear any infected fluid from the joint. This will either be done using a needle and syringe or by arthroscopy, in which a thin, metal tube is inserted through a small cut made near the affected joint. Pain relief: NSAIDs may be given for pain relief and to reduce inflammation. Physiotherapy: Most people will require a lot of physiotherapy to maximize functioning of the joint after infection has cleared, to promote healing and prevent permanent muscle shortening. In some cases, surgery: Occasionally, this may be done to clean the joints. If the septic arthritis followed a joint replacement surgery, the joint replacement itself may need removal. Good to know: Treatment normally involves a hospital stay of two weeks or more, followed by further antibiotics taken orally at home, normally for at least four more weeks.",
    "complications": "If septic arthritis is left untreated, serious complications may arise. These may include: 15 Osteomyelitis, a painful bone infection and inflammation Bone erosions, the loss of bone, caused by destructive joint inflammation Fibrous ankylosis, decreased range of motion, which may be caused by destruction of the joint lining Sepsis, also known as blood poisoning, in which the body attacks its own organs and tissues in response to infection. Sepsis can be life-threatening. Good to know: It is important to seek medical attention immediately if septic arthritis is suspected, to avoid serious complications. The condition can rapidly cause irreversible bone and joint damage and, left untreated, can be life-threatening. However, with prompt treatment, most people will recover well.",
    "septic_arthritis_in_children": "Septic arthritis in children, also known as pediatric septic arthritis, is a very rare but serious emergency that must be treated promptly. Signs and symptoms include: Pain Inability to bear weight on the affected joint Fever Young children with septic arthritis are likely to be irritable and may cry if the infected joint is moved. They may also try to avoid using or putting any weight on an affected joint. If a doctor suspects pediatric septic arthritis, they will immediately refer a child to the nearest emergency department for an assessment. Treatment involves draining the joint, followed by intravenous antibiotics. Ongoing follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon is recommended to monitor and treat long-term effects, such as cartilage damage and growth disturbance. While these effects are rare, early diagnosis and intervention may improve long-term outcomes. 16",

    "faqs": "Q: Is septic arthritis the same condition as reactive arthritis? A: No, septic arthritis is not the same as reactive arthritis. In septic arthritis, infection is present within the joint. Reactive arthritis is an autoimmune response triggered by infection, but the infection is not located in the joint. Reactive arthritis generally lasts from a few weeks to a few months and, while its severity may vary, it normally resolves without serious complications. Septic arthritis can lead to disability and, left untreated, may be life-threatening. In septic arthritis, the infection is treated with intravenous antibiotics. In reactive arthritis, oral antibiotics may be used to treat the triggering infection, but this does not shorten the duration of joint symptoms. Read more about Reactive Arthritis » Q: Osteomyelitis vs septic arthritis – what is the difference? A: Osteomyelitis is infection of the bone, whereas septic arthritis is infection of a joint. Both may have similar causes, such as knife wounds or biting, and may spread through the blood from another location. Osteomyelitis and septic arthritis may also co-exist if, for example, infection spreads from the joint to the bone. Both conditions may have similar symptoms, such as pain in the affected area and fever, so can be mistaken for one another. Both conditions are rare, but can be life-threatening if left untreated, so early diagnosis and treatment with drainage and intravenous antibiotics are important 17 Q: Septic arthritis vs gout – what is the difference? A: Gout may present in a similar manner to septic arthritis, with acute pain, swelling, warmth, and decreased range of motion, normally starting in a single joint. However, both conditions have very different causes, treatments and outcomes. Gout is caused when there is buildup of uric acid in the blood that deposits urate crystals in a joint, causing a painful immune response, whereas septic arthritis is caused by infection in a joint. Septic arthritis may be life-threatening if left untreated. Gout, while it may be acutely painful and, if it develops into a chronic condition, can cause joint damage, it is not life-threatening. It is important to seek medical attention immediately, for appropriate treatment. 18 Read more about Gout » Q: Is viral arthritis a type of septic arthritis? A: No, viral arthritis is a separate condition. Certain viral infections can sometimes present with joint symptoms, which is known as viral arthritis. Viral arthritis tends to be mild and is usually self-limiting. Typically, it only requires treatment of symptoms. In some cases, antiviral treatment may be available to treat the underlying condition. Viral-associated arthritis is commonly caused by parvovirus, which is easily spread through children at school, but tends only to cause arthritic symptoms in adults. 19 Q: Can septic arthritis be fatal? A: Yes, without treatment, septic arthritis may lead to permanent joint damage and can become life threatening. With swift and appropriate treatment, most people can make a full recovery. 5"

People with SCD have atypical hemoglobin, a protein within red blood cells that helps circulate oxygen throughout the body – known as hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin – which causes their red blood cells to become misshapen. As a result, these red blood cells break down more quickly than usual and can block small blood vessels, cutting off the oxygen supply to certain tissues and causing complications. 1 SCD is typically a serious and lifelong condition, requiring long-term treatment and management.

    "types": "There are seven main subtypes of sickle cell disease: 3 4 5 HbSS (commonly known as sickle cell anemia) HbSC HbS beta-thalassemia HbSD HbSE HbSO HbAS In all of these subtypes, “Hb” stands for “hemoglobin”. All sickle cell diseases are hereditary hemoglobinopathies, which means that a person has inherited genetic deformations of hemoglobin from one or both parents. 5 Most of these subtypes don’t have “common” names and are therefore usually called by their abbreviations. The exception is sickle cell anemia. HbSS, or sickle cell anemia, is the most common subtype of sickle cell disease. In this subtype, the affected person inherits one sickle-cell gene from each parent. This is called a homozygous sickle cell disease. 4 In HbSC, the affected person inherits a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a gene for a defective form of hemoglobin, hemoglobin-C, from the other. 5 HbS beta-thalassemia comes in two forms, beta 0-thalassemia, which is quite severe, and beta +-thalassemia, which is milder. These occur when the affected person has inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a beta-thalassemia gene from the other. 3 4 HbSD, HbSE and HbSO are rarer subtypes of sickle cell disease. In these subtypes, the affected person has inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a gene for a defective form of hemoglobin (Hemoglobin D, E or O) from the other. The severity of these subtypes varies. 3 Individuals who have only inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and no abnormal genes from the other have what is known as sickle-cell trait. 5 In these cases, they are unaffected by the abnormal gene but may pass on a risk of sickle-cell disease to their children. 3 If two people with sickle-cell trait have children, those children have a one in four chance of having sickle-cell disease, a one in four chance of being completely unaffected, and a one in two chance of being an unaffected carrier themselves. If you suspect you or a loved one may have sickle cell disease, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of SCD are typically intermittent, meaning they are experienced in episodes that come and go. Symptoms also tend to vary in frequency and severity from person to person and may change over time. They can occur in conditions that cause hypoxia, such as intense physical exertion. Symptoms of SCD may include: 6 7 8\n\nEpisodes of pain – also known as sickle cell crises – are one of the most common symptoms of SCD. The pain can vary in severity and may come on suddenly. Most often it is felt in the bones and joints, though it may also occur in other locations, such as the hands, feet, arms, legs or abdomen. Any area with both sensory nerves and blood supply can be affected during a painful episode. Many people with SCD experience chronic, low-level pain, often in bones and joints. Painful episodes are caused by sickle-shaped cells blocking blood vessels and cutting off the oxygen supply to tissues. Although it is not clear what brings on these episodes, it is thought that changes in the weather, dehydration, stress and strenuous exercise can all act as triggers.\n\nAcute chest syndrome occurs when blood vessels in the lungs become blocked, typically causing chest pain, a high temperature, coughing and shortness of breath. It should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment. Symptoms of acute chest syndrome are: Chest pain, most common in adults Coughing Shortness of breath, most common in adults Fever, more common in children The cause of acute chest syndrome may be multifactorial and may include factors, such as: Infection Blocked blood vessels Shallow inhalation, which can lead to poor ventilation in the lung Obstruction of blood supply (infarction) to the ribs\n\nPeople with SCD are susceptible to severe infection from certain types of bacteria. Common types of infection include: Blood infection, also known as septicemia Lung infection, also known as pneumonia Infection of the surroundings of the brain and the spine, also known as bacterial meningitis Bone infection, also known as osteomyelitis Good to know: Infection, particularly in infants, should be treated as a medical emergency requiring urgent treatment.\n\nPeople with SCD will normally also experience mild to moderate anemia, a lack of hemoglobin. Periodically, however, this anemia can become severe and require urgent medical attention. This may occur suddenly or more gradually. Signs and symptoms of the onset of severe anemia include: Tiredness Shortness of breath Dizziness Nausea Paleness, particularly in the eyelids, lips, tongue and fingernails Read more about Anemia »\n\nAs a genetic disorder, SCD is present from birth, but will not generally begin to display symptoms until an infant is 5 to 6 months old. However, in some areas, routine newborn screening may find the disease. Early signs and symptoms that may indicate the presence of SCD include: Swelling of the hands and feet that may cause pain, also known as dactylitis Fatigue, fussiness and irritability A yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes, also known as jaundice If you are concerned your infant is displaying signs of sickle cell disease, you can use the Ada app to start a free symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "SCD is caused by a gene defect which creates atypical hemoglobin , known as hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin. Hemoglobin S behaves differently to normal hemoglobin, typically changing the shape of red blood cells from their usual spherical, donut-like shape, into a crescent or sickle-like shape. These deformed red blood cells tend to deplete faster than usual, causing anemia , and can block blood vessels, leading to a reduced supply of oxygen to the body’s tissues. 6\n\nIf an individual inherits two hemoglobin S genes from their parents, that person may develop SCD. This may also be the case if an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene plus another type of abnormal hemoglobin gene, such as thalassemia, hemoglobin C, hemoglobin D or hemoglobin E. 9 If an individual inherits one hemoglobin S gene and one normal hemoglobin gene from their parents, they will have something known as sickle cell trait and become a carrier of sickle cell disease. People with sickle cell trait, however, will generally be healthy and only rarely display signs or symptoms associated with SCD. These symptoms can occur during intense exercise or physical exertion.",
    "diagnosing_sickle_cell_disease": "SCD is normally diagnosed following blood tests. To make the diagnosis, a blood sample will be taken and analysed in order to establish what type of hemoglobin is present. If the results prove inconclusive or there is any uncertainty, DNA tests may also be carried out. 10\n\nIn many places, tests for sickle cell disease are carried out on newborn babies as part of the routine postnatal screening process. To do this, a blood sample will be collected from a heel prick and sent to a laboratory for testing. Parents will be informed of the results of the testing as soon as possible. If the results return positive for SCD, a second round of testing will be ordered to definitively confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, parents will have treatment options thoroughly explained to them. Good to know: Postnatal tests will also be able to show whether or not a newborn has a sickle cell trait. This is important, as it may increase the chances of a sibling or the child’s future children inheriting the disorder. 11\n\nTests can also be carried out prior to birth to see whether a child will inherit SCD. This is usually done by using tissue from the placenta or amniotic fluid from the sac surrounding the embryo and can be carried out from around 8 to 10 weeks into the course of a pregnancy .",
    "sickle_cell_disease_treatment": "A number of treatment methods are available to manage the symptoms of SCD and prevent complications. However, in most cases, the **disorder cannot be cured and will **require lifelong management. People with SCD will be treated by a specialist and will be required to attend check-ups at regular intervals. They will also be taught how to recognise the condition’s symptoms, so that treatment can be given as soon as possible after they appear. Staying healthy is an important principle of managing SCD. This will often involve: 6 Antibiotics. Taking daily doses of antibiotics, usually penicillin, is often recommended by doctors, particularly for children of five years of age or younger. This is aimed at preventing infection. Vaccinations. People with SCD, especially children, should ensure they keep up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations, including those against meningitis , influenza and hepatitis B. Vitamin supplements. Extra folic acid supplements are commonly recommended for people with SCD to aid the body in its production of red blood cells. A daily supplement containing zinc , vitamin D , vitamin E , vitamin C and vitamin A, magnesium ), selenium , carotenoids and flavonoids, but not iron, may also be useful.\n\nMost mild to moderate painful episodes (sickle cell crises) will not require a visit to the hospital and can be treated at home. This may involve: Painkillers, usually paracetamol or ibuprofen Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water Antibiotics. These are strongly recommended for children of younger than five, but are optional for older individuals. Should a fever develop, the individual should receive prompt medical attention regardless of whether or not they are on antibiotics If a painful episode is severe, professional medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. If fever appears, medical attention should be sought right away: fever is a medical emergency in people with SCD.\n\nIn people with frequent and severe pain resulting from SCD, hydroxyurea treatment is currently the standard. Hydroxyurea increases the concentration of functioning hemoglobin. This in turn reduces painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, as well as the need for hospitalization and the number of blood transfusions a person with SCD may need. 12\n\nA blood transfusion can be used to treat acute chest syndrome or severe anemia , as well as to prevent or treat certain complications. Blood transfusions, however, are not considered routine due to the complications they can cause, meaning they are only carried out when considered absolutely necessary. Treatment to prevent clotting is recommended for all adults with SCD admitted to hospital.\n\nA stem cell transplant is the only known way to cure SCD. It does, however, come with the risk of severe complications, and its success is not guaranteed. It is generally reserved for very severe cases of SCD.\n\nErythrocytapheresis is a method of reducing hemoglobin concentration to less than 30%. In this procedure, red blood cells are removed from a blood sample, and the rest of the blood is introduced to circulation. 13 In this way, it cuts down the risk of stroke in adults and children from SBC. The treatment has relatively few side effects, all of which can be managed.",
    "sickle_cell_disease_complications": "There are various possible complications that can occur as a result of SCD. Some of the most common complications related to SCD include:\n\nChildren and adolescents with SCD may experience slowed growth and development. Teenagers may also undergo puberty two to three years later than average. Doctors will monitor childhood development closely and may suggest certain vitamin supplements to help manage possible problems.\n\nStrokes are a common complication for children and adolescents with SCD and can occur in adults. Sickle cells blocking blood vessels in the brain can shut off the oxygen supply, causing a stroke. Symptoms may include difficulty with speech and a weakness or paralysis of the face and limbs. In some cases, there may be no noticeable symptoms. Strokes are generally treated with blood transfusions, which are able to improve blood flow to the brain. Read more about Ischemic Stroke »\n\nIf blood vessels in the spleen become blocked, the organ can swell with blood and cause a severe bout of anemia. This will often occur very suddenly and require urgent medical attention. In some cases, treatment may involve removing the spleen completely.",
    "sickle_cell_disease_and_covid_19": "People with sickle cell disease run a high risk of severe illness and death from respiratory infections such as COVID-19 . If you're suffering from sickle cell disease and you get infected with the coronavirus, then you may be eligible for antiviral therapy .\n\nOther possible complications include: Heart, lung or kidney problems Eye or vision problems Unwanted and sustained erections (priapism) Gallstones Leg ulcers",
    "sickle_cell_disease_faqs": "Q: Can sickle cell disease be cured? A: In the majority of cases, SCD cannot be cured. It can, however, be managed and its various complications treated as they occur. A possible cure for SCD is a stem cell transplant, though this is generally only reserved for very severe cases of the disorder, due to the risks associated with the procedure."

    "overview": "HIV tongue symptoms can appear in the first and last stages of an HIV infection. Several infections of the tongue can occur if you have HIV, all with different symptoms. Taking care of your oral health is important in defending yourself against tongue and mouth infections.\n\nHIV tongue symptoms can be an early warning sign of an acute HIV infection or can appear at a later stage when the condition has progressed into AIDS. These tongue symptoms appear because HIV weakens the immune system, giving infections the chance to develop. In this article, you’ll find more information about the possible early signs of HIV on the tongue and an overview of how to protect your oral health.",
    "what_is_an_hiv_tongue": "You can notice signs of HIV on the tongue during the early and late stages of the infection with the virus. An acute HIV infection can have various manifestations in the mouth and on the tongue. These mouth and tongue HIV symptoms occur due to the virus’s attack on the immune system, which weakens it and allows infections to occur. 1 These infections all have their own characteristics and particular treatment methods.",
    "what_does_hiv_tongue_look_like": "Early-stage HIV can show up on the tongue, the gums, and the inside of the mouth. If you start noticing unusual changes in your mouth, then it’s essential to follow up on this with your healthcare provider. HIV tongue symptoms can include : 1 2 Oral Candidiasis , a fungal infection of the mouth, tongue, and throat, is also referred to as oral thrush . Candidiasis usually resembles red patches on the tongue with white lumps on them. These patches can form anywhere in the mouth and on the tongue and can cause a burning sensation. If you wipe or brush away these sores, they typically start bleeding. You may also notice painful cracks at the corners of your mouth and experience pain when swallowing.  As the immune system is compromised due to an HIV infection, the fungus can grow, causing this HIV symptom on the tongue. Canker sores , also called aphthous ulcers . These are small, round, painful sores that can be found underneath the tongue, in the back of the throat, or on the inside of the cheeks or the lips. They usually look red, with a gray or white dot in the middle of the sore. These sores can usually be provoked by stress or after eating certain foods. Hairy leukoplakia is characterized by white, hairy-looking patches that are usually painless. You can notice these patches on the sides of the tongue, and you cannot remove them using your toothbrush. In some cases, the patches can cause discomfort and may even alter your sense of taste. Kaposi sarcoma , which is characterized by dark purple, or red spots on the back of the tongue, the roof of the mouth, or the gums. Oral warts can also be a sign of an HIV infection. Oral warts with HIV may look like bumps on the tongue or the inside of your mouth. These warts are not painful. An HIV tongue with sores is usually due to a viral infection with Herpes . This causes red sores, which can be found inside the mouth or on the lips. Besides these signs of HIV on the tongue, there are also other symptoms of the mouth that may point to an early HIV infection. HIV often causes a dry mouth due to a lack of saliva production. Saliva is vital to your oral health, as it protects your teeth and gums from decay and infections. Gum disease can also occur and can cause your gums to swell and loosen up. This eventually leads to the loss of teeth and high levels of inflammation throughout the body.",
    "when_would_hiv_start_affecting_your_tongue": "HIV tongue symptoms are caused by infections by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Usually, your immune system fights off these infections. With HIV, certain cells of the immune system get destroyed, which debilitates the immune system. This allows for these infections to develop, which causes symptoms. HIV can affect your tongue in the early stages of the infection , which is why HIV tongue symptoms may be an early warning sign of an HIV infection. If your HIV infection is not diagnosed or not under control, then it can progress to AIDS after years. In this late stage of HIV, you can frequently notice infections all over the body, including the mouth and tongue. 3",
    "what_can_you_do_if_you_experience_hiv_symptoms_on_the_tongue": "It’s important to know what a normal tongue vs an HIV tongue looks like. If you start to notice HIV tongue sores or other tongue HIV symptoms, then it’s important to get tested for HIV as soon as possible. If you’ve been diagnosed with HIV, then it’s important to take care of your oral health . You can do so by: 4 Getting regular check-ups at your dentist . Make sure to tell your dentist about your HIV status, HIV symptoms on your tongue, and any changes which you’ve noticed lately. Brush and floss your teeth thoroughly twice per day in order to remove dental plaque. Take your HIV medication as prescribed , according to the plan set out for you by your healthcare provider. This way, your immune system does not get weakened. Most HIV tongue infections happen because of a debilitated immune system, so keeping your immune system healthy is an important step in preventing oral infections. Avoid smoking , as this increases your risk of hairy leukoplakia, thrush, gum disease, tooth loss, and cancers of the mouth, tongue, throat, and lips.",
    "wrapping_up": "Signs of HIV on the tongue can appear both in the early and late stages of HIV. It’s crucial to be aware of your HIV status and to talk to your healthcare provider and your dentist about any unusual changes you may have noticed in your mouth and on your tongue. Maintaining good oral hygiene and taking your HIV medication consistently can help decrease the possibility of developing oral infections.",
    "hiv_and_tongue_symptoms_faqs": "Q: How long does HIV white tongue last? A: A white tongue caused by thrush usually lasts  2 to 3 weeks with the proper treatment. Q: How does your tongue look when you have HIV? A: Your tongue can appear differently depending on which condition you have. If you have thrush, then your tongue can look like it has red patches with white lumps on them. If you have hairy leukoplakia,  you can notice white patches that look hairy. Sores can also appear due to HIV Q: What are the early signs of HIV on the tongue? A: The early signs of HIV on the tongue can be white patches that look hairy, a tongue with red patches with white lumps on them, sores, and warts. Q: Can oral thrush be the symptom of an acute HIV infection? A: Yes, oral thrush can be a symptom of an acute HIV infection. With HIV, the immune system is attacked and weakens. The immune system normally keeps fungus in check, but as it weakens, a fungus in the mouth can take over, causing thrush. Q: Can I get HIV from oral sex? A: There is a risk of getting HIV from oral sex, although the risk is much lower than with anal or vaginal sex. The risk of contracting HIV from oral sex increases if you have open wounds in your mouth or if an HIV-infected partner ejaculates in your mouth."

    "condition": "Signs of Panic Attack",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/signs-of-panic-attack/",
    "what_is_a_panic_attack": "A panic attack is an abrupt episode of intense anxiety or fear accompanied by a number of physical symptoms such as a racing heartbeat and shortness of breath, normally lasting between 5 and 20 minutes. Panic attacks can be highly distressing, but pose no serious physical health risks. 1 Many people will experience a panic attack or two during the course of their lifetime. They tend to occur more commonly when undergoing a stressful life event such as bereavement, a job change or separating from a partner. It is also common to be unable to identify a trigger. If a person experiences recurrent spontaneous panic attacks, without an apparent trigger, this is called panic disorder , a condition which is usually treatable with psychological counseling  and/or medication. If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing a panic attack, the Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how the app works . For more information on panic attacks , such as causes and common triggers, see the resource on panic attacks.",
    "signs": "The signs of a panic attack involve intense mental symptoms as well as physical symptoms. These include symptoms of mental distress , such as the sudden belief that one is dying, and concurrent physical symptoms, such as increased heart rate, sweating and trembling.",
    "panic_attack_warning_signs": "There are two main types of panic attack: expected and unexpected.\n\nThere are typically no perceptible signs of the onset of an unexpected panic attack. Many people report that they are hit by a rush of panic attack symptoms that occur out-of-the-blue, perhaps while doing an everyday task such as ironing or watching television. It is believed that unexpected panic attacks occur in response to a stressful life experience. However, this stress is often outside the awareness of the person experiencing it. For instance, suppose a person has recently lost their job. While out shopping for groceries, the person experiences shortness of breath and a sense of impending doom - panic attack symptoms that seem to happen for no apparent reason. It is likely that such symptoms were brought about by the need to spend money on food without an income, even though the connection may not be obvious to the person experiencing symptoms. Good to know: The occurrence of unexpected panic attacks is required for a diagnosis of panic disorder.\n\nExpected panic attacks may be divided into two types: 2 Situationally bound or cued panic attacks: Expected to occur invariably in specific situations, such as in the case of a person with a social phobia having a panic attack entering into a public speaking engagement. Situationally predisposed: May be more likely in certain situations, but do not always occur on cue nor immediately after exposure, such as in the case of a person who sometimes finds that driving induces a panic attack, or that a panic attack occurs after driving for some time. Expected panic attacks are often preceded by symptoms that may include: 3 Panic An elevated sense of threat or danger Anxiety Helplessness Avoidance Distress about physical symptoms Physical signs of a panic attack, such as increased heart rate and shortness of breath Catastrophic thoughts, i.e. thinking about irrational, worst-case scenarios.\n\nDuring a panic attack, people may have a sense of impending doom, may feel as though they are dying from a heart attack or suffocation, or may feel that they are losing control or going crazy. However the exact experience, and how it is described,  may vary from person to person. A full-symptom panic attack is defined as including four or more of the following physical and psychological symptoms: 4 : Palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate Sweating Trembling or shaking Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering Feeling of choking Chest pain or discomfort Nausea or abdominal distress Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint Chills or heat sensations Numbness or tingling sensations Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself) Fear of losing control or going crazy Fear of dying. A panic attack usually lasts  between 5 and 20 minutes, with most panic attacks reaching their peak at around 10 minutes. Nearly all panic attacks subside in under an hour. It is common to feel exhausted and shaken by the experience of having a panic attack, for minutes or hours after the attack itself is over. If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing a panic attack, the Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how the app works .\n\nPanic attacks vary between people, and some people may experience fewer symptoms. If a person experiences less than four of the above symptoms, this is known as a limited-symptom panic attack. People commonly experience limited symptom attacks while recovering from or undergoing effective treatment for panic disorder, as they learn to use therapeutic techniques to reduce the number and severity of the symptoms they experience during an attack. The duration of limited symptom panic attacks can be variable . A limited symptom panic attack normally peaks in about 10 minutes — the same timescale as a full symptom panic attack. However, it may last only one to five minutes thereafter. Alternatively, it could be part of a panic episode of varying intensity that lasts several hours. 5\n\nIt is possible to experience a full or limited symptom panic attack in one’s sleep. This is called a nocturnal panic attack and involves waking up in a state of panic. The signs of nocturnal panic attacks are the same as those of panic attacks that occur when one is awake, and they may also be the same in terms of their duration and possible triggers. Nocturnal panic attacks are a common occurrence in people with panic disorder, but can also be one’s first or only experience of a panic attack. 6\n\nAgoraphobia is a type of anxiety disorder in which a person fears and avoids places or situations that might cause them to panic and feel helpless, embarrassed, or unable to escape. This usually develops as a complication of panic disorder, and can reduce a person’s quality of life, as they may become afraid of doing everyday tasks. 7 Treatment is normally effective in helping to manage this condition.",
    "management": "During a panic attack, various techniques can be used by a person to try to reduce their symptoms. For example: 8 Deep, calm breathing: This can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of a panic attack. A panic attack tends to cause a person to breathe too fast, which can make them feel dizzy and lightheaded. Progressive muscle relaxation: This is a technique involving the conscious tensing and then relaxing of one’s muscles. This can  help to reduce tension and overall stress levels. Realistic thinking: This involves a person identifying what the frightening thoughts are that can trigger physical feelings of panic, and then identifying whether these thoughts are actually realistic. Good to know: Regular exercise, eating regular meals and avoiding caffeine may help in preventing some panic attacks.\n\nIf panic attacks happen often and interfere with one's life, a psychiatric evaluation for an anxiety disorder might be recommended. Normally, the most effective form of professional treatment for panic disorder is psychological therapy. Even a short course can help. Such therapy commonly includes: 9 10 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT focuses on thinking patterns and behaviors that are sustaining or triggering the panic attacks and helps a person to look at their fears in a more realistic light. Exposure therapy: This includes controlled exposure to the feared situations. It involves facing the feared situation until the panic begins to lessen. Through this experience, a person can learn that the situation isn’t harmful and that they have control over their emotions. Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP): This form of psychotherapy helps a person recognize suppressed and painful emotions, allowing them to resolve such issues with the support of a qualified therapist. Antidepressants have been demonstrated to be effective treatment for agoraphobia with panic disorder , as they help to prevent panic attacks, and improving anticipatory anxiety and avoidance behaviour. These must be taken consistently over time to be effective. 11 The most frequently prescribed groups of antidepressants for panic disorder include: 10 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Benzodiazepines , a type of anti-anxiety medication, may also be prescribed. These medications have a sedative effect that can help quickly reduce panic symptoms and put a person into a more relaxed state. However, Benzodiazepines may be addictive if used in the long term, so they are used cautiously. 12\n\nPanic attacks generally have the same symptoms in children as in adults. 13 They may occur in younger children, but are more common in teenagers. Panic attacks can be particularly difficult for children and young people to deal with. Severe panic disorder may affect their development and learning, as it may, for example, prevent them from studying. 1 14 If you think you or someone you know may be experiencing a panic attack, the Ada app can help you check your symptoms.

    "signs_2": "Q: Signs of panic attack or anxiety – what is the difference? A: Anxiety is the feeling of being nervous, uneasy, or worried. Anxiety exists on a scale, from mild to severe, and may be there all the time, in the background of other experiences. Anxiety is normally triggered by something that is perceived as stressful or threatening. Panic is the most acute form of anxiety. 1 A panic attack normally involves sudden, severe and disruptive symptoms. A panic attack may have no perceptible trigger, and may seem to occur out of the blue. Q: Signs of panic attack vs heart attack – what is the difference? A: Many people become convinced that they are having a heart attack when in fact they are experiencing a panic attack. A heart attack requires prompt medical attention and can be life threatening, so it is important for this diagnosis to be recognised. Many of the symptoms overlap so it can be difficult to tell the difference, however some characteristics which may help to differentiate between a panic attack and a heart attack include: 15 Tingling: If tingling is experienced in a panic attack, it may affect the entire body. In a heart attack, tingling is typically experienced in the left arm. Pain: In a panic attack, pain may be felt as a sharp sensation in the heart, which gets worse when the affected person breathes deeply or puts pressure on the chest. This pain usually disappears within five to ten minutes. A heart attack may feel like a crushing or pressure sensation all over the chest that may extend into the shoulders, left arm, neck and back. Heart attack pain is not made worse by breathing or pressing on the chest. It may be a worsening pain, and normally lasts longer than ten minutes.

    "how_do_you_know_if_you_have_sleep_apnea": "A sleep apnea diagnosis can be made by your healthcare provider. A specific sleep apnea test does not exist, so your healthcare provider will carefully assess your symptoms and medical history, after which certain tests may be performed in order to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. If sleep apnea is suspected, a polysomnogram may be recommended, which is also known as an overnight sleep study. While you’re asleep, certain vital parameters will be checked, such as your respiratory rate, heart rate, and your oxygen saturation. Other parameters such as your chest wall movement and your airflow will also be monitored. Your healthcare provider will then analyze these results to form a diagnosis.

Treatment for sleep apnea will primarily focus on the underlying condition that is causing your symptoms. Some sleep apnea devices can also help alleviate your symptoms: 2 3 A positioning device can help you sleep in a different position A continuous positive air pressure ( CPAP ) device can improve your breathing throughout the night In case you’re suffering from obstructive sleep apnea, a mandibular advancement device can help bring your lower jaw more to the front, which helps avoid obstruction of the upper airway In some cases, sleep apnea surgery can also be recommended. There are some options: 1 2 3 A surgery removing your uvula (the fleshy extension at the back of your mouth which hangs above the throat) or some of the tissue of the soft palate to create more space in the mouth and throat region Some patients may require surgery of the jaw to create more space in this region A new type of surgery is the implantation of a nerve stimulator which stimulates certain muscles that help broaden the airways during the pauses in your breathing",
    "is_sleep_apnea_dangerous": "Sleep apnea itself is not dangerous, but if left untreated, it can lead to the development of other conditions which may be severe. Some possible complications of severe sleep apnea are: High blood pressure Heart attack Stroke Depression Exhaustion. It can cause the tendency to fall asleep unexpectedly, even when driving or doing other tasks.",
    "wrapping_up": "Sleep apnea is a common condition that causes you to stop and restart breathing repeatedly while you’re asleep. This can cause symptoms such as loud snoring, gasping for air, and waking up abruptly. Sleep apnea treatments are available and depend on the cause of your condition. Getting treated is important, as untreated sleep apnea can result in complications.",
    "sleep_apnea_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea? A: The main difference between these two types of sleep apnea is the cause of the condition. Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by something blocking the upper airway, whereas central sleep apnea is caused by an issue with the centers in your brain responsible for your breathing. Q: Is sleep apnea a pulmonary disease? A: Although sleep apnea affects your breathing, it is not a disease of the lungs. The causes of sleep apnea are an obstruction of the upper airway or issues with certain centers in the brain. Q: Can sleep apnea be cured by stomach sleeping? A: If the cause of your sleep apnea is an enlarged uvula, then you may notice a difference in symptoms from sleeping on your stomach. When you’re sleeping on your back, there is a higher possibility that the uvula blocks the upper airway. Q: How long can you live with treated sleep apnea? A: If sleep apnea is being treated properly, then life expectancy is significantly higher than for those who remain untreated."

    "what_is_small_cell_lung_cancer": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a type of lung cancer. Almost all cases of SCLC are caused by smoking. It is mostly centrally located in lungs and grows very rapidly and aggressively, which means it can spread quickly to distant sites. Typical symptoms of small cell lung cancer include coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath and weight loss. SCLC can be diagnosed after carrying out blood tests and scans of the lungs and testing a small sample of lung tissue. Treatment depends on the stage of the cancer. Not all cases can be cured, as the cancer has often already spread by the time of diagnosis. If you think you may be experiencing symptoms of small cell lung cancer, try the Ada app for a free health assessment.",
    "risks_for_small_cell_lung_cancer": "Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the normal cells around them, and can spread into other areas of the body. There are two broad types of lung cancer, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Small cell lung cancer is the less common type. SCLC mostly affects smokers. Non-smokers are rarely affected. This tumor is slightly more common in men than women and is usually diagnosed in people between the ages of 60 and 80.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptoms are: a cough with bloody phlegm chest pain shortness of breath and weight loss. Wheezing and a loss of appetite are also common. If the tumor has spread, symptoms may include headache which is at its most acute in the morning, blurred vision, light sensitivity, nausea, vomiting, confusion, bone pain and difficulty swallowing.",
    "diagnosing_small_cell_luing_cancer": "For people who smoke and display the symptoms of SCLC, a suspected diagnosis is commonly made. A physical examination is then carried out involving blood tests, a chest x-ray, a phlegm test and lung function tests. A small piece of the lung tissue is taken (a biopsy) and investigated to confirm the diagnosis. Further biopsies and scans may be done to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This process is called staging and is important, as the therapy and outlook depend on the stage of the disease.",
    "treatment": "The treatment of small cell lung cancer depends on the size of the cancer and whether the cancer has spread. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, SCLC can be treated by radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery, or a combination of these. The treating doctor can give the best advice about appropriate treatment. People who have SCLC may benefit from taking part in a support group or counseling program, especially whilst undergoing their treatment.",

    "condition": "Smoke Inhalation",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/smoke-inhalation/",
    "what_is_smoke_inhalation": "Smoke inhalation occurs when a person breathes in smoke from burning material or gases during a fire . Smoke inhalation is a leading cause of mortality due to fire, causing approximately 5000 to 10,000 deaths per year in the USA alone. 1 Smoke contains a mixture of harmful chemicals and irritants, though the exact composition depends on factors such as what is being burned, the temperature of the fire and the amount of oxygen feeding the fire. Inhaling smoke can cause the airways and lungs to become irritated, swollen and blocked, and may prevent oxygen from entering the bloodstream. If this happens, respiratory failure can occur. 2 Smoke inhalation requires immediate treatment to prevent complications. The damage to the body inflicted as a consequence of smoke inhalation is often referred to as smoke inhalation injury .",
    "causes": "Smoke inhalation generally occurs when an individual is trapped within an enclosed space during a fire. In most cases, it causes damage through asphyxiation (lack of oxygen) and irritation of the lungs and airways . 3\n\nFire can use up a significant amount of oxygen from the air, leaving less available to breathe. When this happens, asphyxiation can result . The presence of carbon monoxide in the smoke can make this particularly pronounced, as carbon monoxide takes up far more room than oxygen. Carbon monoxide is contained within carbon-containing fuels such as gas, wood, coal and oil. Oxygen combines with the hemoglobin inside red blood cells to create oxyhemoglobin. As the red blood cells circulate around the body, oxyhemoglobin provides the body’s tissues with the oxygen they need to survive. Carbon monoxide can also bind with hemoglobin to create carboxyhemoglobin. As smoke containing carbon monoxide is inhaled, carboxyhemoglobin begins to circulate around the body, causing the tissues to become increasingly starved of oxygen. As carbon monoxide binds roughly 200 times more tightly to hemoglobin than oxygen, this can happen even if there is only a small amount of carbon monoxide present. 3\n\nA fire can create smoke containing a variety of chemical irritants and particles, i.e. unburned or partially burned materials small enough to enter the body, with the potential to cause significant damage to the lungs and airways. Such irritants include sulfur dioxide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride and chlorine. Breathing in these irritants and particles can cause blockage of the airways, inflammation and respiratory failure.",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of smoke inhalation will depend on what exactly has been inhaled (the composition of the smoke), and the duration of smoke inhalation. General symptoms, however, include: 2 4 Coughing and hoarseness Irritated sinuses Shortness of breath, which may lead to total respiratory failure Chest pain Headache Stinging eyes or vision problems Runny nose Loss of consciousness Cardiovascular abnormalities, including cardiac arrest\n\nIf carbon monoxide is contained within the smoke, carbon monoxide poisoning may result. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning typically differ depending on the length of time an individual is exposed and how much carbon dioxide is present. They may include: 5 A tension-type headache Dizziness Nausea and vomiting Convulsions Increased heart rate Stomach pain Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Respiratory arrest Soot in the nostrils and/or throat",
    "smoke_inhalation_diagnosis": "Diagnosing smoke inhalation injury will typically first involve a doctor determining the source of the smoke, how long the individual was exposed to the smoke and the medical history of the individual. After this, a number of tests can be used to investigate the severity of the damage done by smoke inhalation. Due to the need for immediate treatment of smoke inhalation, diagnostic tests will usually take place after initial treatment has been given. Tests used to determine the severity of smoke inhalation-related injuries include: 2 6 Blood gas test: Used to measure the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood, allowing doctors to determine how well the lungs are functioning. Also called an arterial blood gas test if the blood sample is taken from the wrist. 7 Blood tests: A sample of blood will be taken and tested in a laboratory for information about the functioning of the body. Chest X-ray: Used to look for signs of damage to the lungs and for signs of infection. Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscope (tube with a light and camera attached) will be passed through the throat and into the airways to allow doctors to check for damage. Pulmonary function tests: A variety of different tests used to measure air flow and lung size, as well as how well oxygen and other gases enter and exit the blood. 8 Lung VQ scan: An imaging test used to measure air flow in the lungs. Also known as a lung and pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan. 9",
    "smoke_inhalation_treatment": "The person experiencing smoke inhalation should be removed from the scene and taken to a location with fresh air as soon as possible. 3 This will usually be the responsibility of firefighters. Following this, oxygen at a high flow rate should be administered via a facemask . This will help to quickly increase the amount of oxygen dissolved into the bloodstream and prevent asphyxiation. Once the individual has been removed from the scene and taken to a hospital, a number of treatment methods may be used. These include: 1 3 6 10 Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is used for both diagnostic and treatment purposes. Using a bronchoscope, a tube mounted with a light and camera, doctors are able to identify and remove particles and secretions lodged in the airways and lungs. Pain relievers or sedatives may be administered to the individual before the procedure takes place. Hyperbaric oxygenation: If the individual has been exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, hyperbaric oxygenation may be used. This involves the individual being exposed to increasingly high levels of oxygen over a period of 60 to 90 minutes from within a specially designed chamber. This will help to increase the level of oxygen in the blood. Medications: Various medications, including antidotes, antibiotics to help prevent infection, steroids to open the airways and medications used to manage pain, swelling and fever may also be administered.",
    "smoke_inhalation_risks_and_complications": "The inhalation of smoke can cause serious short and long-term health problems and should be considered a serious injury. The lungs may become infected, swollen or fluid-filled, something that can cause respiratory failure. This can lead to severe heart and brain problems and be potentially life-threatening. In the USA, smoke inhalation is the leading cause of death for victims of fire. 11",
    "smoke_inhalation_prevention": "The prevention of smoke inhalation generally involves the prevention of fire. Each year in the USA, the highest percentage of fires occur in residential properties and over half of these are cooking-related. 12 Smoke alarms are critical to the early detection of a fire and should be fitted in every home, workplace and public building on each floor. Fire alarms should be tested regularly to ensure that they work as intended. All buildings should also have an established escape plan for use in the event of fire. This should be reviewed periodically, memorized by the inhabitants or frequent users and practiced regularly. Other fire prevention methods include ensuring that all burning materials – such as cigarettes, candles, stoves and fireplaces – are carefully monitored at all times and thoroughly extinguished after use. Heating systems should also be checked by a professional regularly and fixed if necessary. It may also be useful to make a habit of unplugging all electrical appliances after use and ensuring there is no build-up of lint in the home’s dryer. It is also important to ensure all flammable or combustible materials, such as lighters, matches and oils, are kept out of the reach of children at all times.",

    "condition": "Sprains",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/sprain/",
    "what_are_sprains": "Sprains are common musculoskeletal conditions. Most cases of sprains can be treated at home. 1 Thus, it is important to have an understanding of these conditions. A sprain happens due to overstretching or tearing of a ligament . Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect two or more bones at a joint. Falling, twisting, or getting hit around the area can cause injury to one or more ligaments at the same time. The severity of sprains depends on the extent of injury (whether the tear is complete or partial), and the number of affected ligaments. Ankle sprain, knee sprain, and wrist sprain are some of the common ligament injuries. Sprain symptoms may range from pain, swelling, bruising , and inability to move the joints. On the onset of sprain, people may feel a pop or tear when the injury happens. 2 3 Treatment for sprains may involve rest and pain relief medication . Initial treatment consists of resting the injured area, icing it, wearing a bandage to compress the area, and medicine. Surgical intervention may be an option for severe cases. Follow-up treatment might include exercise and physical therapy. 2 3 If you have an injury that could be a strain, try using the free Ada App to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "causes": "Injuries affecting ligaments and tendons in the case of sprains occur from either direct or indirect trauma. 1 A sprain can occur when the joint is forced out of its normal position. The manoeuvre can stretch or tear the ligament supporting that joint. That can happen in both upper and lower body parts. One of the most common locations of sprain is the ankle. Most sprained ankles sprains happen when the foot turns inward. People may develop this when they run, turn, fall, or land on the ankle after a jump. Other common injuriessites are the knee sprain and sprained wrists . A knee sprain may result from receiving a blow to the knee, falling, or a sudden twist of the joint. People may be more likely to experience wrist sprain if they fall and land on an outstretched hand. 2 3 Read more on repetitive strain injury .",
    "risk_factors": "A sprain can happen to anyone. Some people may be at higher risk, including: 4 Athletes Jumping sports carry a higher risk of foot, knee, and ankle strains and sprains. Some examples are basketball and volleyball Gymnastics, tennis, and golf carry a higher risk of hand, wrist, elbow, rotator cuff, and arm strains and sprains. Contact sports, such as hockey and football, carry a higher risk of any type of sprains and strains. It includes but is not limited to the fingers, thumbs, toes, and neck. Endurance sports (for example, running and triathlon) carry a higher risk of strains from overuse. The commonly affected areas include hips, calves, hamstrings, quads, and other parts of the legs. People with a history of prior sprains or strains, People who are overweight, People who are starting physical activity or exercise programs for the first time, People with neurologic problems, People with balance disorders.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of sprains can vary and depend on the severity of the sprain. These may include: 2 3 pain swelling bruising instability loss of the ability to move and use the joint. Do these symptoms sound familiar? Try Ada to find out more.\n\nTo assess the severity of the sprain, medical professionals may check the grade of injury. 2 5 First degree (mildest) sprains A grade I or mild sprain happens when people overstretch or slightly tear ligaments, leading to the following symptoms: Minimal pain and swelling. Little or no loss of functional ability. Slight or no bruising. Little trouble putting weight on the affected joint. Second degree sprains A grade II or moderate sprain happens the tears going further and cause the following symptoms: Bruising Moderate pain Swelling Difficulty putting weight on the joint Some loss of function. Third-degree (most severe) sprains A grade III sprain is usually severe and happens in case of complete tear or rupture of a ligament. Usually, people are unable to put weight on the joint and have severe: Pain Swelling Bruising",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of a sprain can be made through several steps. People may suspect themselves of having sprains if they develop symptoms. Medical professionals could assist with the diagnosis through history taking, physical examination of the area of injury, and imaging tests such as X-ray, ultrasound, or MRI. 6 7\n\nUltrasound imaging is a non-invasive, safe, and painless medical test to help to diagnose and treat medical conditions. It produces an image of the inside of the body using sound waves. This method uses a small probe called a transducer and gel placed directly on the skin. The probe collects the sounds that bounce back after a high frequency of waves sent into the body through the gel. Ultrasound exams do not involve radiation. Ultrasound can capture images in real-time and it can show the structure and movement of the internal organs. Ultrasound images of the musculoskeletal system can provide pictures of muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, nerves, and soft tissues throughout the body.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another noninvasive test used to diagnose medical conditions. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field, radiofrequency pulses, and a computer to produce detailed pictures of internal body structures. Detailed MR images allow doctors to examine the body and detect disease. This scan test is the choice for examining the: major joints, spine for back pain, soft tissue (muscles, tendons, and ligaments) of the extremities.",
    "treatment": "Important signs should be assessed when an injury happens to decide whether it can be treated at home or needs professional help. Be aware of any deformities, significant swelling, and changes in skin colour. If there are deformities, significant swelling, or pain, it is advised to immobilize the area and seek medical help immediately. 5 Initial treatment for sprains and strains follows the PRICE principle . PRICE principle is suggested for the first 24 to 48 hours after the injury.PRICE stands for: 5 8 Protection Protect the area of concern from further injury by trying to immobilize the area or stay off a weight-bearing joint to prevent further motion and restore alignment. It also may be advisable to use a brace/splint or crutches to stay off the injured area. Rest Restrict the activity and cut back on regular exercises and activities of daily living. An injury like a sprain requires a change in normal routine to let the area heal. Ice Apply an ice pack to the injured area. Do this for 10-15 minutes every two or three hours. A cold pack, ice bag, or plastic bag filled with ice wrapped in a towel can be used. Avoid the risk of ice burn by not touching the skin with ice directly or applying the cold pack for too long. Compression Compression (continuous pressure) of the injured area may help reduce swelling. Use an elastic compression bandage to wrap the affected area. For the upper body, wrap the affected area always from fingers towards the shoulder, while for the lower body, do it from toes to the groin. A bandage should feel snug, but not so tight it is uncomfortable or cuts off the circulation. An easier way to apply compression from the knee down is with compression stockings. Elevation Elevating the injured area may help to decrease swelling. Keep the injured area elevated on a pillow. Try to keep the injury above the level of your heart.\n\nImaging tests to support the diagnosis of a severe sprain or strain or rule out a broken bone. More advanced immobilization of the limb or joint with a splint, cast, or other devices until healing is complete. Rehabilitation or physical therapy can often be helpful to bring an injured joint back to normal. In severe cases, surgery may be needed.\n\nIf the injury is mild and the affected person can tolerate the pain, it may not need any medication. If needed, some painkiller options can be obtained over the counter or prescribed by doctors. The options include the following: 8 Paracetamol Paracetamol is useful to ease the pain. It is best to take paracetamol regularly, for a few days or so, rather than now and then. The recommended dose for adults is one to two 500 mg tablets, four times a day, and always give at least four hours interval between doses. If the pain is more severe, a doctor may prescribe stronger painkillers. Anti-inflammatory painkillers These medicines are also called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They relieve pain and may also limit inflammation and swelling. Ibuprofen and Naproxen are a few examples of anti-inflammatory medication that can be obtained at a pharmacy without a prescription. It is suggested to be cautious when taking any NSAIDs for any potential side effects. Topical anti-inflammatory painkillers Same as NSAIDs, some topical anti-inflammatory painkillers can be obtained without a prescription at pharmacies. These usually contain ibuprofen or diclofenac. Some others may have cooling ingredients, such as menthol, which can give a relieving effect when it is applied. The effectiveness of this option is not clear.  However, there is less risk of side effects of using topical painkillers.\n\nSevere grade of muscular or ligament injury may require surgical intervention to repair the tear. The main surgical indications include: 9 a large intramuscular hematoma(s), a complete (III degree) strain or a partial (II degree) strain if more than half of the belly muscle is torn persistent pain for more than 4 months with functional impairment",
    "prevention": "Some cases of sprain can not be avoided. However, the following efforts may lower the risk of injury: 10 Use protective gear during high-impact sport (for example, wearing protective footwear during activities that place stress on the ankle). Wearing proper fit shoes Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes Always warm-up and stretch before doing exercise and sports Avoid high impact sports and activities without any adequate training Maintain muscle strength and flexibility.",
    "prognosis": "The outlook after an event of a sprain may depend on the severity of the injury. The length of recovery time also may vary. In mild sprains, recovery may be achieved in only a few weeks. In more severe sprains, it could take up to 12 weeks to recover. Surgical repairs of completely torn ligaments will have the longest recovery. 4 Grade 1 (mild) usually heals with conservative treatment, with minimal long-term complications. Grade 2 (medium) has a high risk of tear extension in the first 4 to 6 weeks. Therefore rapid return to work is to be avoided. Grade 3 (severe) can be associated with significant complications. Grade 3 ligament tear also can lead to chronic pain, loss of function, and secondary degenerative changes in the joint regardless of the choice of treatment. Some of the most common long term complications are: Muscle fibrosis, Muscle atrophy, Chronic ligament instability."

    "what_is_stomach_cancer": "Stomach cancer, sometimes called gastric cancer, is a slowly progressing cancer that arises from the stomach. Symptoms of stomach cancer are abdominal fullness, dark stools, nausea, vomiting, and unexplained weight loss, although many people will have no symptoms in the early stages. Men over the age 40, people who have an infection of the stomach by the Helicobacter pylori bacteria, or who have inflammation of the stomach over a long period of time tend to have a higher risk of getting stomach cancer. Stomach cancer is most commonly treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and, sometimes, radiotherapy. Stomach cancer is often diagnosed when it is already in an advanced stage, and this can be difficult to treat. People who are diagnosed early have a better chance of recovery.",
    "risks": "Stomach cancer is an uncommon condition. Cancer occurs when a group of abnormal cells grows uncontrollably. These cells can destroy the normal, healthy cells around them, and can spread into other areas of the body. An important risk factor for the development of stomach cancer is infection with Helicobacter pylori (a bacteria). This bacteria can cause stomach ulcers which, over time, can develop into cancer. Smoking and excessive alcohol intake increase the risk for gastric cancer significantly. Some foods may increase the risk of this condition, and these include smoked foods, salt-rich foods, red meat and pickled vegetables when eaten in large amounts. Some causes of stomach cancers seem to run in families, so having a family member who has had stomach cancer may increase the risk of developing this condition.",
    "symptoms": "People with stomach cancer often have no symptoms in the early stages of the condition. Some people experience abdominal pain , heartburn, a loss of appetite or a feeling of becoming quickly full when eating. As the condition progresses, people may feel weak and tired, and may develop abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, black stools and unexplained weight loss.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, and by carrying out a physical examination and endoscopy, a process which involves inserting a camera through the mouth to look at the stomach. A sample of the stomach ulcer or growth (a biopsy) is taken to investigate for cancer. A CT scan (computed tomography scan) may be done to look at the size of the cancer and for any evidence of spread beyond the stomach.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of stomach cancer depends on the size of the cancer, the exact type of cancer and whether the cancer has spread beyond the stomach. These combination of these factors decides the stage of the cancer. Depending on the stage, stomach cancer can be treated by surgical removal of part of or the whole stomach, by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of these therapies. The treating doctor can give the best advice as to treatment.",
    "prevention": "Stomach ulcers should be treated and followed up with an endoscopy. Giving up smoking and reducing alcohol intake may also help to reduce the risk of stomach cancer. Eating a diet low in meat, and with plenty of vegetables, unsaturated fats and whole grains (a Mediterranean diet) may reduce the risk of stomach cancer.",

    "condition": "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/subarachnoid-hemorrhage/",
    "what_is_a_subarachnoid_hemorrhage": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of stroke, or more specifically brain hemorrhage, in which there is bleeding on the surface of the brain. The bleeding occurs in a space between the layers of tissues that cover the brain, in an area called the subarachnoid space. SAH is a medical emergency and is life-threatening. People who survive an SAH may be left with disability.\n\nAn SAH occurs when a blood vessel bursts between the layers of tissues that surround the brain. This is normally due to a weakness of the vessel walls, which results in a balloon-like swelling known as an aneurysm. A hemorrhage occurs when the aneurysm ruptures, due to the pressure of blood as it is pumped through the brain. The most common symptom is a sudden, very severe headache, often with nausea and vomiting and sometimes loss of consciousness. The diagnosis is confirmed either by doing a CT scan or a lumbar puncture, which involves taking a sample of the fluid from around the spinal cord and testing it for the presence of blood. Treatment depends upon the severity and may include emergency life-saving measures, surgical repair of the hemorrhaging area, and medications to reduce the risk of complications. The prognosis after a subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on the size and severity of the bleeding.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The most common symptom is a sudden, explosive headache called a thunderclap headache, which is often described as the worst headache ever or as if there had been a blow to the head. It may last only a few seconds or even a fraction of a second. 1 There is often a phase of intense headache for days or weeks before the bleed, which may often go unnoticed by doctors as an early warning sign of subarachnoid hemorrhage. If you or someone you know is experiencing a headache, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment. While most people with sudden, severe headaches do not have subarachnoid hemorrhage, a sudden, severe headache should not be taken lightly and warrants medical attention immediately or as soon as possible.\n\nOther symptoms may include: 2 3 Nausea and vomiting Dizziness A stiff neck Blurred or double vision Eyes which are sensitive to light Drowsiness Slurred speech Weakness on one side of the body Confusion Convulsions, i.e. uncontrollable shaking Loss of consciousness",
    "what_causes_subarachnoid_hemorrhage": "Subarachnoid bleeding is bleeding in the head that occurs in the subarachnoid space, the space between the layers of tissue that cover the brain. This can cause pressure on the brain and problems supplying the brain with blood. It is commonly due to the rupture of a saccular aneurysm, also known as a berry aneurysm: a small, berry-like swelling that forms within the head due to a weak spot in an artery wall. Occasionally, there may be another cause for subarachnoid bleeding, such as in traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, when trauma to the head or neck, such as might be sustained in a car accident or a fall, may cause blood to leak into the subarachnoid space from nearby structures of the head. 1",
    "risk_factors_for_subarachnoid_hemorrhage": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage  is not common. It tends to be more common in middle-aged adults, although it can affect people of any age. Risk factors which most commonly contribute or lead to SAH include: 1 4 High blood pressure High or excessive consumption of alcohol Smoking Cocaine use Risk factors that lead to SAH less commonly include: 1 5 Head and neck trauma, when bleeding from injury to the brain or other nearby structures leaks into the subarachnoid space, which is known as traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage Certain inherited conditions that weaken the blood vessels, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan-Syndrome, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vasculitis, when blood vessels inside the body, and therefore possibly also inside the brain become swollen and inflamed due to infection or to conditions affecting the immune system. Brain infection such as encephalitis or meningitis",
    "how_is_a_subarachnoid_hemorrhage_diagnosed": "Anyone displaying any signs of stroke should immediately be taken to a hospital emergency room for diagnosis, preferably by ambulance. Once there, a doctor will typically perform a physical examination and, if necessary, medical stabilization of the person. They will also obtain the person’s medical history, before a number of other tests and scans are done: 3 6\n\nBrain scans are very often used to help confirm a diagnosis. A scan can also help to show the severity and location of the bleed and help detect additional problems it may be causing. Brain scans should be carried out as quickly as possible after the person reaches the hospital, allowing for prompt and appropriate treatment to be received.\n\nA CT scan of the head is, in general, the best method to detect bleeding. Additionally, it is quicker and more widely available than an MRI scan.\n\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to build a detailed image of the interior of the body. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) scan may be included with an MRI scan. This is a procedure that shows the blood vessels of the brain so doctors can identify the location of the bleeding, often without the need for injecting a contrast agent. If a contrast agent is used, it will involve an injection of dye into a vein using a peripheral intravenous line, usually placed in the veins of the arms or hands.\n\nDigital subtraction angiography (DSA) involves inserting a small, thin tube into a blood vessel in the leg and passing it up to the blood vessels in the brain. A contrast dye is injected through the catheter, and X-ray images are taken of the blood vessels. DSA has been considered the most accurate scan to visualize aneurysms, but also has its own limitations, so that many factors will influence whether this procedure is used by doctors in a given case. The DSA procedure is normally carried out after a diagnosis of subarachnoid bleeding is made based on the CT scan and/or lumbar puncture results. It may also be performed if the CT and/or lumbar puncture tests are inconclusive. It may be repeated within 15 days after a subarachnoid hemorrhage, if an aneurysm is still suspected. 7\n\nIf the diagnosis is still uncertain after doing a CT scan, often a sample of fluid from an area below the spinal cord will be taken and investigated for blood. This procedure is known as a lumbar puncture or, colloquially, a spinal tap. 7 The brain and the spinal cord are surrounded by a clear liquid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cerebrospinal fluid will contain signs of blood if there has been an SAH. A lumbar puncture involves taking a sample of the CSF by inserting a needle between two vertebrae – bones of the spine – at the lower end of the spine known as the lumbar region. A small amount of this fluid is drawn into a syringe and examined in a laboratory, where the presence of blood may be confirmed.",
    "subarachnoid_hemorrhage_treatment": "A subarachnoid hemorrhage is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical attention and treatment. The aim of treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage is to stabilize the affected person, prevent further bleeding or rebleeding from the aneurysm, which may be at risk of rupturing once  again, and prevent further brain injury. 1\n\nLife-saving or supporting measures, such as help with breathing and blood pressure control, may be needed in the time directly following an SAH, especially if the bleed is big enough to cause a significant increase in the pressure inside the head.\n\nSome medications are given to treat subarachnoid hemorrhage and its effects in the short term. These may include: 8 9 Nimodipine, which can help prevent vasospasm , a possible complication of SAH (see vasospasm and improve blood supply to the brain, which can help improve the neurological outcome after an SAH from an aneurysm) Blood pressure medication to reduce the chances of rebleeding Pain relief, commonly opioids and acetaminophen, not only reduce pain but also in turn reduce the chance of rebleeding, as pain leads to higher blood pressure, which can contribute to a higher chance of rebleeding Anticonvulsants to prevent seizures Antiemetics to stop the affected person from feeling sick and vomiting Stool softeners, such as docusate and senna help to prevent rebleeding from increased blood pressure due to straining to pass a bowel movement If the person suffers from coughing, antitussives , such as codeine, may be given to suppress coughs, which can help prevent rebleeding.\n\nSurgery might be needed to treat SAH. Surgery aims to treat the aneurysm that was responsible for the SAH, as well as any other aneurysms that may be present. The risk of rebleeding is high initially after an SAH, so these procedures are done as soon as possible, usually within 72 hours. There are two main surgeries that may be given to treat a berry aneurysm and prevent it from bleeding again: coiling and clipping: 10 Some complications may require different surgical approaches earlier or later on, such as to lower the pressure inside the skull or to remove clotted blood.\n\nCoiling is usually done under general anesthesia, meaning the person treated is fully asleep, relaxed and doesn’t feel any pain. A flexible tube, known as a catheter, is inserted into an artery in the leg or groin and passed along the blood vessels in the body until it reaches the aneurysm in the brain. The aneurysm is blocked from the inside by inserting small platinum coils into the aneurysm, once the catheter has reached its location . This prevents further bleeding by causing blood to clot around the coils, sealing off the weakened area.\n\nAnother surgical procedure known as clipping may instead be used to stop or prevent an aneurysm from bleeding or rebleeding. A clipping procedure is done under general anesthesia, too. It involves opening the skull in a procedure known as a craniotomy. During clipping, a neurosurgeon places a tiny clip across the neck of the aneurysm to block the blood flow from entering the aneurysm.\n\nThe procedure chosen is often dependent on factors such as the location, size and shape of the aneurysm. Coiling is often preferred because it aims to be minimally invasive, as it does not involve opening the skull and has a lower risk of short-term complications, such as seizures, than clipping. Coiling also tends to lead to a shorter hospital stay and a shorter recovery time, though these factors are generally more dependent on the rupture’s severity than the type of surgery used. However, since coiling is a relatively new procedure, the long-term benefits over clipping are not entirely certain yet and are partially still being evaluated. Depending on the affected person’s health status and medications, as well as the size and location of the aneurysm, among other factors, a doctor will recommend a treatment that best suits the individual’s situation and needs.\n\nTriple H therapy is sometimes used to prevent and treat vasospasm , a possible complication of SAH in which a blood vessel goes into spasm, causing the vessel to narrow and the blood supply to the area of the brain supplied by this vessel to become dangerously low (see vasospasm). Triple H therapy aims to improve blood flow and oxygen delivery in the brain. It does this by a combination of induced: 9 ] H ypertension, meaning high blood pressure H ypervolemia, meaning high fluid volume in the blood H emodilution, meaning decreased concentration of solid particles in the blood resulting from a gain of fluid In vasospasm, the diameter of cerebral vessels is reduced, increasing the resistance to blood flow. Increased arterial pressure is required to overcome this resistance. 11 Triple H therapy is only sometimes used because its efficacy remains uncertain, and it may carry significant risks. 12",
    "subarachnoid_hemorrhage_recovery": "The time it takes to recover from a subarachnoid hemorrhage depends on its severity and if complications, such as re-bleeding, occur. Recovery commonly takes a minimum of three weeks. For many, it may be several months, and some symptoms may be permanent, despite intense rehabilitation efforts. Most people will need at least three months till they feel able to return to previous activity levels, such as hobbies and work, but this time frame may in many cases be substantially longer. Some affected people may not be able to return to their previous occupation. Associated problems, such as loss of feelings in the limbs or problems understanding speech, are determined by the location of the hemorrhage. Such problems can ideally be successfully treated and may get better over time (see difficulties ), but may also be permanent in some cases.",
    "subarachnoid_hemorrhage_complications": "A number of complications can arise in the days and weeks after a person has experienced an SAH, either while they are still in hospital or once they are at home or in a rehabilitation facility. These complications are important to recognize and treat in a timely manner, as they can, in some cases, lead to serious health problems and may be life-threatening. Some of the most common complications include:\n\nParticularly in the few days after the SAH, the aneurysm is at risk of bleeding again. This is known as rebleeding. Repair of the aneurysm should be done as soon as possible, generally within 72 hours, to avoid rebleeding, as it can lead to permanent disability or may be life threatening.\n\nVasospasm is a common complication of an SAH. If it occurs, it is usually between the fourth and fourteenth day after the initial SAH. Vasospasm is when a blood vessel goes into spasm, causing the vessel to narrow, and the blood supply to certain brain areas become dangerously low. The brain relies on a constant supply of blood to provide it with oxygen and nutrients. When the supply of blood becomes blocked, brain cells can quickly begin to stop working. If the blockage lasts for more than a couple of minutes, these cells can start disintegrating, leading to serious damage to the brain. Depending on the location and supply area of the affected vessel, the damage can range from mildly debilitating to severe or life-threatening. Common symptoms of vasospasm include: Drowsiness Stroke-like symptoms, such as weakness down one side of the body or speech problems Treatments are available to prevent and treat vasospasm, such as nimodipine and triple H therapy. Read more about the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage »\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to a buildup of fluid inside the skull, as it commonly disrupts the production and drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A buildup of fluid inside the skull, known as hydrocephalus, increases pressure on the brain tissue, which can lead to brain damage if not treated quickly enough. Hydrocephalus may be treated with an external ventricular drain, which allows the temporary drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles of the brain, relieving raised intracranial pressure.\n\nSeizures may develop after an SAH, usually starting within the first year after the hemorrhage. Symptoms of seizures usually last up to a few minutes per bout. Common symptoms of seizures include: 13 Loss of consciousness Muscle twitching and jerking Becoming stiff Medications are available to treat and prevent seizures as much as possible, and some doctors may prescribe or recommend anti-seizure medication, even if a seizure is yet to occur. Read more about Generalized Seizure » .",
    "difficulties_after_subarachnoid_hemorrhage": "A person’s physical abilities can often be restricted immediately after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The extent to which the person is affected varies, including such problems as recurrent headaches and prolonged feelings of drowsiness and fatigue. Some people experience a feeling of numbness or weakness in parts of their body and, rarely, even a complete loss of power. Other reported difficulties include difficulty swallowing and a loss of balance. This can sometimes lead to additional problems, including: 3 6 Deep vein thrombosis, dangerous blood clots which are more likely to form if the person is not moving around for long periods Unhealthy nutrition because of difficulty swallowing or chewing Aspiration pneumonia, a type of pneumonia caused by food or drinks being accidentally inhaled into the lungs Falls and other accidents related to a sudden loss of balance and/or physical weakness Physical rehabilitation will usually begin in the hospital to improve muscular function and is often continued in an inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation center after hospital discharge.\n\nCognitive dysfunction is when a person experiences problems with one or more brain functions, especially those related to their thinking abilities. It affects at least half of the people who have experienced an SAH, to some degree. Some common thinking problems include: Memory problems, such as problems remembering names or faces, or making and keeping new memories. Difficulty concentrating for longer periods of time, often on previously straightforward tasks, such as making a cup of tea, and being easily distracted. Difficulty solving more complex tasks. This is due to increased tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and other complex effects of the bleeding. Some examples include: Tasks at work that require more thinking than routine behaviour Repairing broken objects in a logical order Solving crossword puzzles Cognitive difficulties can improve with time and treatment. An occupational therapist may be able to help overcome difficulties by setting therapeutic activities to practise, helping to find new ways of doing things or suggesting equipment that could help. 14\n\nSome people may find that their speech becomes slurred or slowed, or that they have difficulty finding the right words to express themselves. This usually improves gradually. A language therapist may be able to advise on management of speech difficulties.\n\nAfter SAH, many people experience emotional problems, feel fearful of living with future complications or illness recurrence and may feel a loss of confidence in everyday tasks or social activities. These problems may include: 15 Low, depressed mood and mood swings Clinical depression Crying or laughing easily, sometimes with no apparent reason or in socially inappropriate situations The feeling that the person’s personality has changed Developing generalized anxiety disorder Developing post traumatic stress disorder Denial about the consequences of the SAH Emotional difficulties generally improve with time and treatment, and there are various treatments available to help, including: Talking therapies, such as psychotherapy Medications, such as antidepressants Support groups to speak to others who have had similar experiences",

    "faqs": "Q: Subarachnoid hemorrhage vs subdural hematoma – what is the difference? A: A subdural hematoma is another condition where blood collects on the surface of the brain in a layer of tissue between the arachnoid space and the dura, a tough layer covering the inside of the skull. The two conditions have similar symptoms and may both cause brain damage. It is usually caused by a head injury, whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage is usually caused by a weakness in the blood vessel walls. Both a subarachnoid hemorrhage and a subdural hematoma very often cause a headache as their primary symptom. The subdural hematoma headache is a headache that often comes on more slowly and may be severe from the beginning or increase in severity over time, whereas the subarachnoid hemorrhage headache is known as a thunderclap headache, very sudden in onset and severe from the beginning. 16 There may also be a phase of intense headache for days or weeks before a subarachnoid hemorrhage as an early warning sign of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which may often go unnoticed . Q: What is a hemorrhage? A: Hemorrhage is another word for bleeding, the loss of blood from a ruptured blood vessel. It can happen inside the body or on the outside of the body. A person may bleed when they get a cut or other wound. They may also bleed due to an injury to internal organs. Sometimes, bleeding can be a sign of an underlying condition. In other cases, bleeding can cause further complications, for instance if too much blood is lost, or if the hemorrhaging occurs in parts of the body where it will cause a problem, e.g. due to bleeding into a small, closed space like the skull, such as in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage . Q: Subarachnoid hemorrhage vs intracerebral hemorrhage – what is the difference? A: Both intracerebral hemorrhage, sometimes also referred to as a cerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage are types of hemorrhagic stroke, where a blood vessel ruptures or bursts in or around the brain. An intracerebral hemorrhage is when a blood vessel within the brain tissue or the brain ventricles ruptures, whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage is bleeding between the layers of tissue that surround the brain. Intracerebral hemorrhages are about twice as common as subarachnoid hemorrhages. Read more about Hemorrhagic Stroke » Q: Aneurysm vs stroke – what is the difference? A: An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel wall that is caused by a weak spot. It has the potential to rupture. Such a rupture in a vessel running on the surface of the brain can cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a type of stroke. Not all aneurysms cause stroke, and not all strokes are caused by an aneurysm. Q: I am experiencing the worst headache of my life. Am I having a stroke? A: While most people with sudden, severe headaches do not have subarachnoid hemorrhage, a sudden, severe headache should not be taken lightly and warrants medical attention immediately or as soon as possible. The most common symptom of a type of stroke known as a subarachnoid hemorrhage is a sudden, explosive headache called a thunderclap headache, which is often described as the worst headache ever or as if there had been a blow to the head. It may last only a few seconds or even a fraction of a second. Good to know: SAH is a life-threatening emergency. If suspected, medical attention should be sought immediately, and the person affected should be transported to a hospital in the quickest possible way, e.g. in an ambulance."

    "what_is_subluxation_and_dislocation": "Dislocation of the hip refers to a state in which the head of the thigh bone (the femur) is brought out of the socket of the hip joint (the acetabulum) and the two joint surfaces are separated. The injured hip is usually painful and it may not be possible to bear weight on the leg. A hip dislocation should be reviewed urgently by a doctor, and the bones should be relocated as quickly as possible. Once the joint is repositioned, most people recover well.",
    "risks": "A hip dislocation occurs when the thigh bone is knocked out of the hip joint socket. Hip dislocations are more common in old age . People who have had a hip replacement are at special risk of developing a hip dislocation, and this is one of the more common causes. Other causes are injuries to the pelvis or leg, especially injuries involving extreme force, such as those incurred during a car accident. This injury can occur during some high-impact sports , such as downhill skiing, gymnastics, rugby and American football. Children born with hip dysplasia (faulty hip development before birth) are at increased risk of developing this condition. 1",

    "condition": "Subluxation or Dislocation of the Radial Head",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/subluxation-or-dislocation-of-the-radial-head/",
    "what_is_subluxation_or_dislocation": "Subluxation of the radial head is an injury affecting the elbow joint. The term subluxation means partial dislocation, while the radial head is the name given to the top of the radius,  one of the two large bones found in the forearm. Therefore, subluxation of the radial head is an injury where the top of the radial bone becomes partially dislocated from the rest of the elbow. 1 The condition, also commonly referred to as a pulled elbow, babysitter’s elbow, nursemaid’s elbow, RHS or annular ligament displacement, can be caused by a quick pull to the forearm and is a common injury in children, particularly between the ages of one to four. 2 This is because the annular ligament that holds the radial bone in place at the elbow is much weaker in young children, leading to a greater risk of it slipping over the radial head when faced with a sudden, pulling force. ref19 People with a pulled elbow tend to hold the affected arm close to their body, often supporting it against the stomach or with the other hand, and are unwilling to use the arm. They may report pain in the arm. Usually, a subluxation of the radial head can be easily fixed by a doctor by slipping the joint back into place, and complications are uncommon. 3 Full dislocations of the radial head are much less common in children and are also rare in adults. If they do occur, they are typically the result of a high-force trauma or are a congenital condition. Symptoms may be similar to a pulled elbow, but more severe. It is usual for full radial head dislocations to appear in connection with other related injuries in the arm, such as a forearm fracture. 4 Treatment therefore focuses on all associated injuries and may involve surgery.",
    "types": "Types of radial head subluxation and dislocation include:\n\nThese terms are all different names for exactly the same injury: a partial dislocation of the radial head. This elbow injury is the most common form of dislocation that can happen to the head of the radius bone in the forearm, and it typically occurs in children aged between one to four years old. Toddlers aged between one to three years old account for over 80 percent of pulled elbow cases. 2\n\nChildren are much less likely to experience a full radial head dislocation than a radial head subluxation. However, full dislocations do sometimes occur in children and are still a more frequent injury than subluxations in adulthood. 4 Dislocation of the radial head is often found in people who have sustained a high-force injury, such as a significant car crash or heavy fall. It is typically associated with another injury, such as a fracture to the ulnar, the other bone in the forearm. 4 The condition can also arise due to a congenital abnormality that is present from birth. 5 It is extremely rare for a full dislocation of the radial head to occur in isolation. 4",
    "symptoms": "Because subluxation of the radial head/pulled elbow occurs most frequently in toddlers and young children, it is important to look out for tell-tale symptoms that they may have suffered this injury, such as: 3 6 7 Holding the injured arm close to the body Holding the injured arm in a slightly bent position, usually between 15-20 degrees Supporting the weight of the injured arm with the other hand Unwillingness to use the arm Unwillingness to fully stretch or flex the arm Wrist, arm or elbow pain that is often poorly localized, i.e. dull, vague, aching Although a pulled elbow does typically cause some pain, especially when the injury first happens, it is not always the primary sign that an injury has occured. In some cases, a child may continue to act normally, apart from their reluctance to use the affected arm. 3 Notably, a pulled elbow does not generally cause swelling, bruising or any other type of disfigurement to the affected area. 7\n\nFull radial head dislocations usually result in similar, but slightly more severe symptoms than a pulled elbow. For example, the affected person may still hold the injured arm in a bent position, but at a more acute 90 degree angle. They may also experience a higher degree of pain and show even more reluctance to move the arm. One major symptomatic difference between radial head subluxations and full dislocations is that full dislocations usually result in noticeable swelling to the elbow, whereas subluxations do not. 4 Concerned you may be experiencing a radial head subluxation or dislocation? Use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "There are two bones in the forearm: the radius and the ulna. Both of these bones meet the bone of the upper arm, the humerus, at the elbow. Together, these three bones form the elbow joint. The top, or head, of the radius is surrounded by a flexible, fibrous band of tissue known as the annular ligament, which connects the radius to the rest of the elbow joint. Radial head subluxations are caused when a part of the annular ligament slips over the head of the radial bone, thereby causing the ligament to become trapped in the radiohumeral joint. 2 The symptoms experienced as part of a radial head subluxation are a result of the annular ligament’s displacement. A subluxation is a partial dislocation, meaning the bone still has some contact with the ligament. 1 A full dislocation means that the radius bone has been forced fully out of position.",
    "risk_factors_for_radial_head_subluxation": "The radial bone can be quite easily subluxated in young children because the annular ligament, that holds the elbow bones in place, is weaker in children than in adults. 8 This injury most commonly occurs when there is a sudden tug on the child's arm, causing the bone to pop out of place. Possible risk factors for radial head subluxation or pulled elbow include: 8 3 6 Pulling a child forward by the arm Holding a child’s arm in place as they pull away Holding or catching a child by the arm as they fall Lifting or swinging a child by the arms Pulling a child’s arm through a sleeve Good to know: Falls are not a common cause of a pulled elbow as they are much more likely to result in break or fracture injuries. 9 By five years of age, the annular ligament in the elbow has usually grown strong and tight enough to prevent radial head subluxations from happening with such ease. 8\n\nFull radial head dislocations are typically the result of either an injury or a congenital condition that is present from birth. 5\n\nIf caused by an injury, it is extremely rare for the radial head to become dislocated without the presence of any other associated injuries. Disruption to the ulna, the other bone located in the forearm, is the most common associated injury. Injuries sometimes associated with a radial head dislocation, include: 4 10 11 Ulnar fractures, such as Monteggia fractures Other elbow dislocations, such as posterior, anterior and divergent dislocations Elbow fractures, such as humeral condyle fractures Complex forearm injuries, such as the Essex-Lopresti injury. This injury consists of a rupture to the interosseous membrane – a ligament-like sheet of tissue that provides stability to the bones in the forearm – as well as fracture to the radial head and disruption to the joint that connects the two bones in the forearm, called the distal radioulnar joint. In adults, dislocation of the radial head is most frequently the result of a high-force injury or trauma, such as a car crash. The dislocation is usually accompanied by other injuries to the elbow or forearm. 12\n\nSome children may be born with a congenital radial head dislocation. This is rare, although it is the most common type of congenital elbow abnormality. 13 When it does occur, it is usually seen in conjunction with other genetic conditions or syndromes, including: 4 12 14 15 Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of disorders which all affect the body’s connective tissues and can result in joint hypermobility Nail-patella syndrome, a genetic disorder which can result in skeletal abnormalities Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a condition which often results in low bone density Radioulnar synostosis, an abnormal connection between the radius and ulna bones in the forearm Klinefelter syndrome, a chromosomal condition in which male babies are born with an extra X chromosome, which can result in weaker and more fragile bones Achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder that causes dwarfism and can affect the elbows Omodysplasia, a rare skeletal abnormality that causes limb shortening Hereditary multiple exostoses, where masses of bone develop on long bones in the lower and upper limbs, resulting in potential deformities Mesomelic dysplasia, a bone growth disorder that often results in underdeveloped bones in the legs and forearm Osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic condition that results in brittle and easily breakable bones Infants with a congenital radial head dislocation are often asymptomatic, which means they may display no immediate signs or symptoms of the dislocation. For this reason, diagnosis of the radial head dislocation may occur later in life when they starts using the affected limb more frequently. 13",
    "diagnosis": "A diagnosis of radial head subluxation or dislocation is primarily based on a clinical evaluation by a doctor. This evaluation usually includes: 3 6 7 Physical examination of the affected arm Discussion of the symptoms experienced Discussion of medical history Whether a partial dislocation or a full dislocation of the radial head is suspected, a doctor will first need to eliminate a number of other conditions that can present similar symptoms. Such conditions include: 6 16 17 Radial head fracture Other fractures that can affect upper limb mobility, such as fractures to the ulna, clavicle, wrist, hand and other locations in the elbow Soft tissue hand injuries Other medical conditions that can restrict arm mobility, such as arthritis or a type of bone infection called osteomyelitis Neurological causes When the affected person displays typical clinical signs of a subluxation or pulled elbow, an X-ray is usually not required. This is because a subluxation is only a partial dislocation, and typically does not show up on an X-ray. 3 However, an X-ray may be conducted if: 6 16 A full radial head dislocation is suspected Associated injuries are suspected, such as a fracture Symptoms are inconclusive or unusual Initial attempts to reset the subluxated joint are unsuccessful In some cases, an ultrasound test may also be conducted to further assess the injury and avoid misdiagnosis. Ultrasounds can be a useful diagnostic tool in young children who may not be able to fully communicate their symptoms. 6 MRI scans can also be used to confirm diagnosis and assess damage to the surrounding ligament. However, this would usually only be suggested to people who have experienced recurrent elbow dislocations and therefore may have significant tissue damage. 16 People who are concerned they may be experiencing a subluxation or dislocation of the radial head can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "treatment": "The exact method chosen to treat a radial head subluxation or dislocation can depend on a number of factors, such as: 16 18 Whether the injury is a subluxation or a full dislocation Whether any other associated injuries, such as fractures, are present Whether the affected person is a child or adult Whether the condition is the result of an injury or a congenital abnormality\n\nAttempts to manually manipulate the radial head back into the joint, known as a closed reduction, is usually the first treatment method for people without associated injuries. 3 Closed reductions can often be quickly and easily performed by a doctor, particularly in pulled elbow cases. If a pulled elbow is suspected in a baby or child, it may not even be necessary to administer sedatives or pain relief before attempting to move the bone back into place. 3 However, if the affected person is an adult, or the injury is a full dislocation, pain relief medication may be prescribed during the closed reduction process. A soft click might be heard as the radial head slips back into its correct position. Once reset, it is usual for the affected person to regain normal function and movement of their arm within half an hour. 6 When function has returned, there is usually no further treatment required. A sling or cast may be offered to help support or immobilize the arm during recovery. 16 If a closed reduction is unsuccessful, pain continues, or the affected person is still not able to fully use their arm after a couple of days, further tests such as X-rays may be required, and surgical intervention might become necessary. 16\n\nSurgical treatment to put the radial head back into place, known as an open reduction, may be recommended for people who have other injuries, or people for whom closed reduction attempts were unsuccessful. 6 18 Adults are more likely to be recommended for surgical treatment than children because their joints are less flexible and may not be as easily restored as those in children. Surgery may target the radial head itself or, when there are associated injuries, may target the associated injury instead. For example, when the forearm bone known as the ulna is fractured, fixing the ulna usually results in the radial head moving back into place of its own accord. Plates and screws may be used to fix the ulna in place, ensuring normal length and alignment of the bone following a fracture. This reduces the chance of radial head dislocation occuring again in the future. 18 Because radial head subluxations and dislocations are complex injuries that can present similar symptoms to other injuries, they have the potential to be missed or misdiagnosed by medical professionals, leading to a chronic condition. If left undiagnosed for more than three years, deformities to the radial head can develop. 18 . For this reason, previously undiagnosed radial head subluxations or dislocations are often treated surgically. When a radial head dislocation is due to a congenital abnormality, initial treatment is usually non-surgical. 15 If surgery is required, it is often conducted in adulthood to correct restricted movement, pain or cosmetic concerns. 14",
    "prevention": "Pulled elbow injuries can often be prevented by providing carers of young children with a better understanding of how the injury occurs and what scenarios are most likely to cause it, e.g. swinging a child by the arms or pulling a child firmly by the arm. 16 Full radial head dislocations are most often the result of high-force injuries such as car accidents or significant falls. Therefore, avoiding high-risk scenarios such as contact sports or motorsports may help prevent injury from occurring.",
    "other_names_for_subluxation": "Pulled elbow Babysitter’s elbow Nursemaid’s elbow Partial dislocation of the radial head Annular ligament displacement RHS Pronatio dolorosa Good to know: While subluxation of the radial head has a variety of different names, full dislocation of the radial head is most often referred to simply as dislocation of the radial head.",
    "radial_head_subluxation_and_dislocation_faqs": "Q: Are radial head subluxation and dislocation the same thing? A: No, they are two different types of a similar injury. A person with a radial head subluxation has a partial dislocation, where the annular ligament that holds the radial bone in place at the elbow has slipped over the top of the bone. A dislocation is where the affected bone is forced completely out of position. Worried you or a loved one may have a subluxation or dislocation of the radial head? Use the Ada app to carry out a free symptom assessment. Q: Does radial head subluxation or dislocation occur in adults? A: Yes, although both conditions are more common in childhood. Subluxations of the radial head/pulled elbows most commonly occur in children under the age of five and are rare in people older than this. 16 It is such a common injury in this age group, because the annular ligament that connects the radial bone to the rest of the elbow joint is much weaker in young children. By five years of age, the annular ligament is usually sufficiently strong to hold the radial head in place when a pulling force is placed on the arm. Adults are more likely to experience a radial head dislocation than a subluxation. Usually, the injury is the result of a trauma or high-force injury, such as a car accident or heavy fall. Q: Is it possible to experience bilateral elbow dislocation? A: Bilateral elbow dislocation, meaning the dislocation of both elbows at the same time, is extremely rare. A 2012 study commented that only 12 cases of bilateral elbow dislocation had ever been reported in medical literature. 19 Q: Will subluxation or dislocation of the radial head require an X-ray? A: An X-ray is usually not required when treating a radial head subluxation. This is because the injury typically does not not show-up on an X-ray, and also because, in some cases, the injury can be easily reset after a clinical evaluation, without the need for any further diagnostic tests. If attempts to reset the joint are unsuccessful, a doctor may then recommend an X-ray to see if there are any underlying issues preventing manual treatment. An X-ray is also more likely to be suggested to people who are suspected to have a full radial head dislocation, other associated injuries, or who are displaying inconclusive symptoms. Q: What is a congenital radial head dislocation? A: A congenital radial head dislocation is when the condition occurs due to a genetic abnormality or syndrome that is present from birth, rather than acquired through force or trauma. Often, this condition is initially asymptomatic and only presents when the child is slightly older and begins using their arm with more frequency. Congenital radial head dislocations can usually be treated without the need for surgical intervention. Q: What is a chronic radial head dislocation? A: A chronic radial head dislocation is a dislocation that has been previously neglected, either through omission or misdiagnosis. Undiagnosed radial head dislocations can lead to elbow stiffness, limited function, deformity and pain. Once detected, chronic radial head dislocations are usually corrected through surgery."

    "what_are_gallstones": "Gallstones, also known as symptomatic cholelithiasis, are hard, crystal-like deposits that can form in the gallbladder below the liver. They can range in size from as small as grains of sand to as large as golf balls – although small stones are much more common. In most cases, the stones remain in the gallbladder and do not cause any discomfort. However, inflammation of the gallbladder wall can occur. This is referred to as cholecystitis. If a gallstone emerges from the gallbladder, it can block the bile duct – thus forcing the bile to overflow from the liver into the intestine. This condition is called choledocholithiasis. The main symptom of symptomatic gallstones is pain in the upper right or middle part of the abdomen, directly below the ribcage. Usually, the diagnosis can be made quickly if a doctor collects a person’s medical history (anamnesis) and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests, and ultrasound. Treatment depends on the individual case. The overall prognosis is excellent. 1 , , 3",
    "what_are_the_causes": "Gallstones develop when there is an imbalance in the composition of bile. Bile is formed in the liver, stored in the gallbladder, and finally released into the intestine. When someone eats a high-fat meal, the bile is needed to bind the fats from the food. The majority of gallstones are made mostly of cholesterol and are called cholesterol stones. In these cases, the amount of cholesterol within the bile is too high and causes the formation of a solid stone. Less commonly, there are also gallstones made up of bilirubin , a breakdown product of red blood cells, and also gallstones caused by an imbalance of bile salts, lecithin, or calcium carbonate. 3 , 4 , 5 The most important risk factors for the development of gallstones are: 5 overweight the female sex age over 40 years old pregnancy European, Native American, or Hispanic descent family members with gallstones certain medications some pre-existing conditions – such as diabetes , sickle cell anemia , cirrhosis of the liver , cystic fibrosis , and Crohn's disease",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "In the majority of cases, gallstones do not cause any symptoms or problems. Symptoms typically occur when gallstones cause gallbladder or bile duct blockages. In these cases, the following symptoms may occur: 1 , 3 , 5 remitting pain in the upper right part of the abdomen fever or chills nausea and vomiting itchiness yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice) light-colored stools dark urine. If these symptoms occur, you should seek medical assistance as they may be signs of an infection or inflammation of the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas.\n\nThe main symptom of gallstones is pain in the upper right or middle part of the abdomen, directly below the ribcage. This pain can occur suddenly and can spread to the arm, right shoulder, back, or chest. Some people experience the pain as sharp and stinging, while for others it can be a deep pain. This is also known as colic or colic-like pain. It is often triggered by a heavy meal and can wake a person up at night. 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 The pain is sometimes confused with a heart attack. Gallstone pain usually lasts between half an hour and a few hours. The pain attacks often come in relapses and subside as the stone moves and the blockage dissolves. In some cases, the pain can subside just a few minutes after. 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 If you think that you might have gallstones, you can try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.",
    "what_is_the_diagnosis_for_gallstones": "A doctor will first make an anamnesis, in which the symptoms and the medical history will be inquired. The doctor will then carry out an extensive physical examination. The doctor can press on the upper right part of the abdomen and ask the person to take a deep breath during the examination. Pain may indicate an inflammation of the gallbladder. After that, some tests are usually carried out to confirm the diagnosis. It is important to rule out other diseases that can sometimes cause similar symptoms, such as appendicitis , gastritis , and kidney stones . 5 , 8 Diagnostic tests for suspected gallstones may include: , 3 , 5 , 8 , 9 Blood test : This is done in order to: see if there are any signs of infection or inflammation of the bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, or liver . check the function of the liver. Abdominal ultrasound :A rapid, non-invasive examination using sound waves to confirm the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder This is the most commonly used examination method for suspected gallstones. Inflammation of the gallbladder can also be detected in this way. Endosonography : This is also a procedure that makes use of the advantages of ultrasound technology. The device consists of a flexible tube at the end of which an ultrasound probe is attached. The examiner first inserts the tube into the mouth and then pushes it forward into the abdomen so that an ultrasound image can be obtained at close range. The diagnosis can thus be confirmed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) : This is the preferred method if a stone is suspected to block the bile duct. This examination method uses an endoscope. The examiner moves the endoscope through the person’s throat and esophagus into the stomach and upper intestines. In addition, the examiner can accurately visualize the bile duct using contrast media and if possible, remove the stone in the same session. CT examination : This is an imaging procedure in which X-rays are used in several layers in order to: confirm the presence of gallstones in the bile system. check for possible complications, such as blocked bile ducts and pancreatitis. MRI examination : An imaging procedure that uses a strong magnetic field to produce a detailed, three-dimensional image of the body. Good to know: Gallstones can also be discovered by chance if you are examined for other complaints or as part of a general health check. As long as the gallstones do not cause symptoms, in this case also known as silent gallstones, treatment is usually not recommended. However, a doctor can inform you about symptoms that you should be aware of from that point on. 8 , 10",
    "how_are_gallstones_treated": "In general, gallstones are usually only treated if they cause discomfort. Only roughly every fourth person who has gallstones without symptoms will develop symptoms within 10 years. , 5 , 11 If there are complaints, a few general measures are carried out first: temporary fasting of food or decreasing intake of fatty foods administration of medications that relieve the body’s spasmodic tensions against the blockade caused by the stone administration of painkillers. 5 The following steps depend on the exact location of the gallstone and the problems caused.\n\nThe surgical removal of the gallbladder, called a cholecystectomy, is the preferred treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis – i.e. when gallstones are present and lead to discomfort. It is a common procedure that is considered the most effective way to eliminate symptoms in the long term and to prevent possible complications from gallstones. 12 , 13\n\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy: This is a type of keyhole surgery in which the gallbladder is removed through a small incision in the abdomen. In some cases, a person can go home on the same day. In other cases, you will need to stay in hospital for a few days of monitoring. Open cholecystectomy: This is an older type of surgery that requires a larger incision in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder. This may be necessary if laparoscopy is not advisable or complications occur. The recovery time is longer with this type of surgery.\n\nYou can lead a normal and healthy life without a gallbladder. After the removal of the gallbladder, the bile flows directly from the liver into the intestine via the connecting bile duct, without being temporarily stored in the gallbladder as before. The bile continues to support digestion as usual. In some cases, mild diarrhea or digestive disorders may occur temporarily. The risk of complications from a cholecystectomy is considered low. 5 , 12 , 13\n\nThis procedure is the preferred treatment option for bile duct blockage. The examiner moves the endoscope into the abdominal cavity. From there, the examiner can accurately visualize the bile duct using contrast media and if possible, remove the stone in the same session. If there are further gallstones in the gallbladder, surgery is often recommended. 5 , 12 , 13\n\nNon-surgical treatments are usually only recommended if surgery is not possible, e.g. if a different state of health makes surgery non-recommendable. Treatment options may include the following: Medications containing bile acid: This is an attempt to increase the solubility of bile and thus dissolve gallstones. The treatment period is at least six months. A recurrence of gallstones is common. 5 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL): X-rays that emit shock waves to break gallstones into smaller pieces. Afterwards, medication must be taken to dissolve and excrete the debris. This procedure is rarely used today for gallstone treatment. 5 , 12 , 13 Good to know: Unfortunately, gallstones usually do not dissolve on their own. It is sometimes possible to dissolve cholesterol stones with certain medications. However, this can take a long time and often does not work. Also the nowadays rarely used method of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, in which gallstones are shattered into smaller pieces (see above), can contribute to the excretion of the stones. But even if the gallstones disappear by these methods, it is likely that new stones will form over time. 3 , 6 , 11 , 14",
    "what_is_the_prognosis_for_gallstones": "Most gallstones do not cause any symptoms and don’t require treatment. Whenever symptoms occur, treatment is necessary. However, the overall prognosis is excellent and most people fully recover. 13",
    "what_are_the_complications": "The majority of people with gallstones have no symptoms whatsoever. In these cases, usually no treatment is necessary. Even if symptoms occur, there are low-risk treatment methods available today, which makes the prognosis extremely favorable. In individual cases, or if no treatment is given for existing complaints, the following complications may occur: 1 , 3 , 5 , 13 cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) injury and/or infection of the bile ducts (i.e. the liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Inflammation of the bile ducts is referred to as cholangitis.) intestinal obstruction. These complications often require emergency treatment. As already mentioned above, medical attention should be sought immediately for the following symptoms: 3 , 5 severe, persistent pain in the abdomen fever chills yellowing of the skin or eye whites (jaundice).",
    "gallstones_faqs": "Q: Can gallstones go away without surgery? A: Unfortunately, gallstones do not usually dissolve on their own. It is sometimes possible to dissolve certain types of gallstones with certain medications. However, this can take a long time and often does not work. Also, the current, yet rarely used method of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, in which gallstones are shattered into smaller pieces, can contribute to the excretion of the stones. But, even if the gallstones disappear by these methods, it is likely that new stones will form over time. 3 , 6 , 11 , 14 Q: Are gallstones dangerous? A: In the majority of cases, gallstones do not cause any symptoms or problems. But, you should seek medical attention immediately if the following symptoms are present: severe, persistent pain in the abdomen, fever, chills, or yellowing of the skin or eye whites (jaundice).Even if symptoms do occur, there are low-risk treatment methods available today, which makes the prognosis extremely favorable. 3 , 5 In individual cases, or if no treatment is given for existing complaints, the following complications may occur: cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), injury and/or infection of the bile ducts, or intestinal obstruction. 1 , 3 , 5 , 13 Q: Can you pass gallstones naturally? A: Usually gallstones form in the gallbladder and remain there since it’s very unlikely that they will dissolve. If they pass, there are two things that can happen. Either they get stuck in the duct that connects the gallbladder to the intestine, known as the common bile duct, which leads to symptoms, such as pain. Or if they are small enough and do not get stuck in the duct, then they may cause some temporary pain. However, they will eventually reach the intestine and will be expelled."

    "what_is_syphilis": "Syphilis is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterial infection, this infectious organism is known as Treponema pallidum. There are 2 general types of infection: acquired syphilis and congenital syphilis (when an infected mother transmits the infection to the baby during pregnancy). Overall, young adults are the group most commonly affected by syphilis. The early symptoms are small, painless sores on the genitals and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin. This condition can affect many different parts of the body, so later, symptoms can differ widely from person to person. Practising safe sex using condoms helps to reduce the risk of catching syphilis. Antibiotics are used to treat the infection, with early and effective treatment, most people recover well.",
    "causes_and_risk_factors": "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a microorganism called Treponema pallidum. 1 Syphilis infection is most commonly found in young adults aged 25-29 years. 2 Certain factors can increase the risk of contracting a syphilis infection, these can include: 3 4 Practising unsafe sex such as not using condoms Having multiple sexual partners Having sex with an infected partner Being infected with HIV or another STI Born to a mother who has been infected with syphilis during pregnancy ; leading to congenital syphilis Illicit drug use (sharing needles) Oral sex is also an important route of transmitting Treponema pallidum where the transmission can occur despite the use of condoms. 1 In addition, men who have sex with men (MSM) are also at higher risk of contracting a syphilis infection, particularly if they're also co-infected with HIV. In 2019, approximately 56.7% of all reported primary syphilis and secondary syphilis cases in the US occurred in MSM. 5",
    "what_syphilis_stages_exist": "Acquired syphilis has 4 stages: primary, secondary, latent and tertiary: 1 4 6 Primary syphilis is the initial stage of infection. In this stage, a flat, painless ulcer known as a chancre develops at the point where the infection entered the body. The chancre usually appears between 10 and 90 days after infection and heals on its own after about 3 to 12 weeks. The chancre will heal whether or not the affected person receives treatment. However, unless the infection is treated, the affected person remains infectious even once the chancre has healed. Secondary syphilis develops around 4-8 weeks after a primary syphilis infection, however, symptoms can occur up to 6 months after a primary infection. Secondary syphilis can develop in individuals who are not treated for primary syphilis. Symptoms can include a widespread rash, swollen lymph nodes and involvement of other organs, which is less common. Latent syphilis is the presence of Treponema pallidum bacteria without any symptoms of primary, secondary or tertiary infection. 7 Latent syphilis comes in 2 forms: 1 4 6 7 8 Early latent syphilis : infection occurs within the past 12 months; around 25% of patients experience a relapse of secondary syphilis Late latent syphilis : infection occurs more than 12 months ago; no relapse and not infectious Tertiary syphilis can occur years to decades after initial infection and can have life-threatening complications with organ involvement. Any organ can be involved such as the nerves, ears and eyes, but the 3 main forms of tertiary syphilis include: 1 4 7 8 Benign tertiary syphilis (also known as Gummatous syphilis): a rare complication where soft rubbery lesions, also known as gummas form on the skin, and organs, particularly the liver and bones. They can break down and form a sore, and if untreated, can destroy surrounding tissues. Bone involvement can cause excruciating pain. Gummatous syphilis can be treated with IV Penicillin. 9 Cardiovascular syphilis ; the bacteria infect the heart and blood vessels and can present in the form of aortitis (inflamed aorta), aneurysms, and signs and symptoms of heart failure which can be life-threatening. Neurosyphilis is a form of syphilis that affects the brain, the membranes covering the brain, and the spinal cord. Although it's most often associated with the tertiary stage of syphilis, it can occur at any stage of the condition. 10",
    "what_is_congenital_syphilis": "It's also possible for pregnant people who have contracted syphilis during pregnancy to pass on the infection to their children in utero, meaning in the womb, this type of infection from mother to child can be called Congenital syphilis. 8 11 Complications of congenital syphilis include: 11 12 Miscarriage Stillbirth Prematurity Low birth weight Death shortly after birth It's important to note that untreated congenital syphilis contains a high risk of stillbirth and death due to infection as a newborn. Babies born with congenital syphilis can experience skin rashes, meningitis, neurological problems such as blindness or deafness, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes or skin), enlarged liver or spleen, anaemia, and bone deformities. 11 Manifestations after birth are categorized into 2 stages: early and late congenital syphilis. Early congenital syphilis is when manifestations can occur within the first 2 years of age and late-stage manifestations occur after 2 years. 13 Clinical signs may not be present at birth, this can take up to 3 months to develop. It's recommended that all pregnant women should be tested for syphilis during the first antenatal care visit. 11 If tested positive for syphilis, treatment should be started right away to reduce the risk of transmission to the baby. 11",
    "syphilis_symptoms_what_does_syphilis_look_like": "There are 2 major symptoms that strongly suggest a primary syphilis infection. They heal spontaneously therefore may not always be noticed. These symptoms are: 4 8 13 a painless ulcer (also known as a chancre) in the genital region, mouth or buttocks painless, rubbery swollen lymph nodes Sometimes ulcers may be painful and multiple in numbers. Medical research suggests that a co-infection with Herpes or Chancroid may be the cause. Multiple syphilis ulcers may also be found in a co-infection with HIV 13 . If you are concerned that you may have contracted an infection, you can do a free symptom assessment using the Ada app at any time. Secondary syphilis symptoms may arise 4-8 weeks after, and up to 6-months following a primary infection. Non-specific symptoms can include fever, muscle pain, joint pain, fatigue and malaise (sense of discomfort and becoming ill, or lack of well-being). There may also be: 13 More widespread swollen lymph nodes Rash in the palms, inner soles of the feet, trunk or scalp (the rash may be in the form of a papule (small raised bumps on the skin) which can become an ulcer) Ulcer in the inside of the mouth Wart-like lesions in the genital area (known as condylomata lata) Patchy hair loss Organ involvement – uncommon Latent syphilis does not show any signs or symptoms; this can be referred to as asymptomatic. **Tertiary syphilis symptoms are characterised by end-organ complications which often occur many years after infection. These include: 4 8 10 13 Benign tertiary syphilis: chronic skin ulceration and organ involvement; causing enlargement of organs (organomegaly), infective or destructive lesions (gummatous lesions) – a rare form of tertiary syphilis Cardiovascular syphilis: chest pain and difficulty breathing – a cardiology consultation is advised. Neurosyphilis, although most associated with tertiary syphilis can occur at any stage of a syphilis infection. A variety of neurological problems can arise and symptoms can include: 13 Headache, loss of hearing, meningismus (headache, neck stiffness, photophobia – being sensitive to light along with nausea and vomiting), vision problems, damage to the spinal cord, behavioural changes, memory impairment, seizures, tremors, loss of reflexes Congenital syphilis symptoms after birth are categorised into 2 different stages: early congenital syphilis and late congenital syphilis. Symptoms of early congenital syphilis include: 14 Large blisters Copper-coloured rash on palms of hands Papules (raised bumps) around the nose, mouth and diaper area General swelling of lymph nodes Enlargement of the spleen and liver Runny nose – discharge can be bloody Inflammation of the bones and cartilage can be found in early congenital syphilis, this can cause bones to develop improperly and restrict movement of the infant. In late congenital syphilis , symptoms are seen after 2 years of life, infants can present with: 14 Ulcers (sores) in the mouth Abnormal development of bones (affecting the shins, face) Problems with development of the teeth Blindness or scarring of the eye Hearing loss – can occur at any age",
    "diagnosis_syphilis": "The diagnosis of syphilis is usually made based on the symptoms, a physical examination and a blood test for syphilis antibodies, which are proteins that fight the infection. Testing for syphilis antibody is also known as serology. Serology testing for syphilis is usually done on blood samples, 2 types of tests that are used in diagnosis are: 4 8 13 Treponemal tests : detect specific antibodies to Treponema pallidum Non-treponemal tests : non-specific, test for antigens produced by a syphilis infection, not specifically for the Treponema pallidum microorganism itself. This acts more as a screening tool. At-home syphilis tests are also available, where a blood sample can be collected from a finger prick\n\nNon-treponemal tests can produce false results, therefore a treponemal test is carried out initially, followed by a non-treponemal test to confirm the diagnosis. This is more time and cost effective. In primary and secondary syphilis, diagnosis can also be made by using darkfield microscopy. This is when a sample of fluid is collected from the syphilis sore or swollen lymph node, and examined under a special microscope. For latent syphilis , serology testing can be carried out. Diagnosis of tertiary stage syphilis relies on clinical symptoms and blood test results. In the case of suspected neurosyphilis ; a lumbar puncture (LP) may be needed. A lumbar puncture is when fluid is collected from the spine, for diagnostic purposes. For early congenital syphilis can be done during a routine blood test during pregnancy, this test is usually repeated during the 3rd-trimester and at delivery. The collected samples are examined by microscopy.Collected samples include: Blood sample from the mother Sample from the placenta Sample from the umbilical cord Lesion during active infection of the mother During active infection of the mother, a physical examination may be carried out by the doctor to look for symptoms and manifestations. It is advised that children who show signs, symptoms and a positive blood test should undergo a lumbar puncture, to investigate the involvement of the brain. Physicians can make a diagnosis of late congenital syphilis in the presence of specific symptoms that are associated with it along with a positive blood test. An X-ray may also be required in the presence of bone deformities in children. 14",
    "syphilis_treatment": "The treatment of syphilis is with appropriate antibiotics. 15 An injection of Benzathine penicillin G is the first line treatment according to the CDC for a syphilis infection. 15 16 The form of administration of the medication, dosage, and length of treatment are determined by the stage and clinical manifestations. Current recommendations are: 15 16 Primary, secondary or early latent syphilis: single-dose long acting Benzathine penicillin G Latent syphilis: 3 doses of long-acting Benzathine penicillin G at weekly intervals It is important to remember that if you are allergic to penicillin, alternative antibiotic medication can be prescribed. The most commonly used alternative is Doxycycline . Within 24 hours of starting antibiotic therapy, some patients can experience an illness with fever, headache and muscle pain, this is known as a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. 17 Corticosteroid therapy may be considered to minimize the risk of Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. 17",
    "syphilis_prevention": "There are certain measures which you can take to prevent being infected with syphilis as well as passing it onto others. These include: 18 Use condoms when having vaginal, anal or oral sex Make sure to complete your treatment regimen if you are taking medication for a syphilis infection Do not share adult toys Do not share needles",
    "syphilis_faqs": "Q: Is syphilis contagious? A: Yes. Syphilis can be passed from person to person. Most people contract syphilis through sexual contact with an infected person, but it is also possible for mothers with syphilis to pass the infection on to their children during pregnancy. Rarely, people who share injection apparatus or who are pricked by a contaminated hypodermic needle may contract syphilis if the needle has been used by someone with syphilis. Q: Who should be tested for syphilis? A: Those who should seek testing for syphilis include: Any asymptomatic person who is concerned that they may have been exposed to syphilis by a sexual or intimate partner Anyone showing any symptoms of any stage of syphilis All pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant Anyone who has recently had unprotected sex with a new partner whose STI status they do not know Anyone who has recently had unprotected sex with multiple partners Anyone who has another STI, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, or whose partner has disclosed that they have an STI Anyone who is HIV-positive Men who have sex with men Anyone who has previously had syphilis Q: What should I do if I think I have syphilis? A: Anyone who suspects that they may have syphilis should go to a doctor, clinic or specialized sexual health clinic and ask to be tested for syphilis. Q: Should people who do not show symptoms but think they may have been exposed to syphilis seek testing for syphilis? A: Yes. It is possible for syphilis to be asymptomatic. If you think you have been exposed to syphilis by an intimate or sexual partner, but do not show symptoms, you should seek testing. It is especially important to seek testing if you may fall pregnant, engaged in unprotected sex, and/or have multiple sexual partners. Q: Are people who have unprotected sex at risk of contracting syphilis? A: Yes. Syphilis is spread by sexual activity, such as oral sex, anal sex and vaginal sex, as well as any other genital contact and sharing of sex toys. Syphilis is transmitted by direct contact with a chancre during sex. Q: Can one contract syphilis through sharing sex toys? A: Yes, if one’s sexual partner has syphilis, and sex toys are shared between partners."

The reason why this happens is not well understood, but certain medications, smoking and having a family member with SLE all increase the risk of a person developing this condition. SLE is more common in women than men, and tends to affect adults between 18 and 50 years of age. SLE can cause different symptoms in different people, but some common symptoms are tiredness, fever, joint pain, muscle aches, weight changes and a rash on the nose and cheeks. Treatment of this condition aims to control the symptoms and and prevent complications.",
    "risks": "Autoimmune conditions occur when the immune system mistakenly produces antibodies (proteins which fight infections) which attack the body's own healthy cells. The reasons why this occurs in people with SLE is not clear, but it's probable that several factors combine to cause this condition. Genetics probably play a part, as SLE tends to run in families. Smoking and certain medications may also trigger the condition. Women tend to be affected more frequently than men, and most people are diagnosed between the ages of 18 and 50.",

    "what_is_tendonitis": "Tendonitis, or tendinitis, is a condition where tendons become swollen or inflamed. Tendons are fibrous tissues that connect muscle to bone or to another body part, such as an eyeball. 1 Tendons can become swollen, inflamed or damaged through injury or stresses created by overuse. Ageing can also lead to tendonitis as body tissues lose elasticity. 2 Tendon damage is not always present with inflammation. Where inflammation is absent, the condition is often referred to as tendinosis, rather than tendonitis. Tendonitis, tendinosis and tendon ruptures are all forms of tendinopathy, a general term to describe tendon degeneration. For example, more specific forms of tendon degeneration are iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) and sesamoiditis. 3 4 Tendonitis is a common condition. People who take part in sport and exercise are more likely to develop tendonitis, as are people who perform repetitive actions, such as playing racket sports, running or typing. Tendonitis will typically heal with appropriate treatment. The recovery time will depend on how severely the tendon is damaged and may take up to several months. People experiencing  possible symptoms of tendonitis can use the free Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "symptoms": "The main symptoms of tendonitis is pain: 2 5 6 Pain is felt along a tendon, particularly near a joint Increased pain when moving the joint In the early stages, pain is only felt when the tendon is in use In the early stages, pain may go away after a warm-up exercise In later stages, pain may also be felt as a dull ache after the tendon is used Pain may be experienced as a burning sensation Other symptoms of tendonitis can include: 6 Tenderness around the joint Swelling of the joint area Thickening of the tendon Nodules on the tendon Crepitus, a grating sound or feeling , usually experienced in Achilles tendonitis or as iliotibial band syndrome symptoms Any tendon can be affected by tendonitis, but it commonly occurs in the: 2 7 Heel (Achilles tendonitis) Elbow (“elbow tendonitis” such as tennis elbow or golfer’s elbow) Knee (patellar or \"knee tendonitis”) Iliotibial band (iliotibial band syndrome or iliotibial band friction syndrome) Wrist and thumb (“wrist tendonitis\" or “De Quervain’s tendinosis”) Shoulder (“shoulder tendonitis” or “rotator cuff tendonitis”) Biceps (“biceps tendonitis”) Foot (posterior tibial tendonitis, peroneal tendonitis, extensor tendonitis or sesamoiditis) Hands (extensor tendonitis) Hip Hamstring People experiencing possible symptoms of tendonitis should see a doctor for evaluation. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The most common cause of tendonitis is overuse of or injury to the tendon. This can arise from a number of activities, which include: 6 Playing sport or exercising, particularly with poor technique or equipment Using a hard, high-friction or inclined surface to play sport Repetitive motions, such as lifting, gripping or twisting Lack of body flexibility Lack of cardiovascular conditioning Using some muscles more than others Accidents, such as falls Wearing high-heeled shoes Previous history of tendonitis Repeated use of tendons is thought to be the primary cause of tendonitis. Tendonitis linked to overuse of a joint is a form of repetitive strain injury . 8",
    "specific_tendonitis_types": "The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscle to the heel. Achilles tendonitis is most often caused by overuse or sometimes by injury. Achilles tendonitis can occur: 9 10 If there is a sudden increase in activity levels When running on hard surfaces Due to not wearing properly fitting footwear When calf muscles are tight During running or exercising to excess During repeated jumping Achilles tendonitis can also be caused by bone spurs in the heel rubbing and irritating the tendon. This is more common in people with arthritis. 9 Read more about Achilles Tendonitis »\n\nThe iliotibial band (IT band) connects the gluteal muscles to the outside of the knee. Iliotibial band syndrome, also known as IT band syndrome , is a common cause of lateral knee pain in athletes. Women tend to get more affected than men. It is often caused by overuse of the tendons on the outside of the thigh. Activities that can lead to this involve a rapid and prolonged flexion and extension of the knee. This creates friction of the IT band and inflammation.ExemplasExamples of these are: Cycling Running on an inclined surface (hill/sky running) Playing tennis or soccer Skiing Weight lifting Military-style exercises.\n\nTennis elbow, also known as lateral epicondylitis, is caused by overuse of the tendons on the outside of the elbow. Although this condition is often called tennis elbow, it is related to excessive wrist flexing and is more common in people who do not play tennis. 11 Activities that can lead to overuse include: 12 13 Playing racket sports , such as tennis Repetitive gripping , such as cutting meat, painting or using a screwdriver In some cases, the cause of tennis elbow cannot be determined.\n\nPatellar tendonitis, also known as jumper’s knee, affects tendons connecting the kneecap to the shinbone. It usually affects athletes in sports which require a lot of jumping, such as basketball or volleyball. It is caused by repeated stresses to the knee, particularly when jumping on hard surfaces. 14\n\nPeroneal tendonitis affects tendons in the outer side of the foot. It is common in people who run or play sports, such as soccer, football, basketball or dancing. 15 16 Peroneal tendonitis can sometimes be misdiagnosed as an ankle sprain .\n\nDe Quervain’s tendonitis affects tendons in the wrist and thumb. It causes pain and swelling in the thumb side of the wrist. Tendonitis in the wrist and thumb occurs due to overuse of the wrist, through repetitive activities such as typing or scanning. Tendons for the thumb pass through a tunnel in the wrist. If these tendons, or their protective sheath, swell or become inflamed, it can put pressure on nerves and cause pain. 17 18 Pregnant people can also develop De Quervain’s tendonitis. It usually goes away four to six weeks after birth. 17 De Quervain’s tendonitis can also be called De Quervain’s tenosynovitis and De Quervain’s tendinosis, as the condition is not technically tendonitis. Tendinosis is degeneration of the tendon without inflammation being present, and tenosynovitis is inflammation of the sheath covering a tendon. 19 4 De Quervain’s tendonitis may be confused with carpal tunnel syndrome.

These tendons can develop tendonitis through overuse and age, as well as by rubbing against bone to become inflamed. 20 21 Activities that can cause tendonitis in the shoulder include: 22 Repeatedly lifting the arm overhead , such as while painting, swimming, playing basketball or racquet sports, doing gymnastics Overuse of the shoulder in sports, such as while rowing and kayaking Keeping the arm in the same position for long periods of time, such as while typing Poor posture Sleeping on the same arm\n\nBiceps tendonitis occurs around the front of the shoulder, in the long head of the biceps tendon. It often presents alongside tendonitis in the rotator cuff tendon. Biceps tendonitis can develop through overuse and age. 23 24 Activities that can cause tendonitis in the biceps include: Repeatedly lifting the arm overhead , such as while swimming or playing basketball or tennis Sudden overuse , more commonly seen in older people.\n\nTendonitis in the foot, also known as posterior tibial tendonitis, posterior tibial tendon dysfunction or adult acquired flatfoot, occurs when the tendon connecting one of the calf muscles to the inside of the foot becomes damaged or inflamed. 25 26 27 Posterior tibial tendonitis can occur because of an injury or overuse. People at particular risk include: People who play high-impact sports , such as basketball or tennis Women over the age of 40 People who are obese Diabetics Over time, damage to this tendon causes the arch of the foot to fall, also known as flat foot. This can create pain in other areas of the foot as the shape of the foot changes. 25\n\nExtensor tendons are located in the backs of the hands and the top of the foot. There is little skin or protective tissue around them, and they are prone to damage, as the hands and feet are in almost constant use. 28 29 30 Extensor tendonitis is most commonly caused by overuse. Activities that can cause the condition include: Wearing shoes that are too tight Prolonged typing with force or without ergonomic support Being on one’s feet a lot Running uphill excessively, such as on a treadmill Playing a musical instrument Gardening .\n\nThe two sesamoid bones of the big toe joint are embedded in the tendons that are part of the plantar plate. The plantar plate is a ligament that connects the joints of the foot. It goes along the ball of the foot.  Foot sesamoiditis is the inflammation of the bones and the tendones that contain them. It can be caused by: Ballet dancing or other forms of dance Jumping from a height Jogging or running Having high-arched feet Wearing high-heeled shoes.\n\nHip tendonitis affects the tendons in the hip area, and may be accompanied by strain to the hip muscles. It can be caused by: 31 Performing repetitive actions An injury or impact to the joint Exercising to excess Not warming up properly before exercise\n\nThe hamstring muscles are in the back of the thigh and allow the knee to bend. The hamstring tendons attach at the back of the knee. Hamstring muscles can be strained, resulting in pain at the back of the thigh, or the tendons can become inflamed, resulting in pain in: 32 33 The back of the knee The back of the thigh Hips Buttocks Lower back Hamstring tendonitis is generally caused by excessive overuse.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition which causes inflammation of joints and associated tissues. If tendons are affected, it can lead to inflammation and tendonitis. 34 35 Read more about Rheumatoid Arthritis »",
    "risk_factors_for_tendonitis": "There are a number of factors that can increase a person’s risk of developing tendonitis. People who repeatedly use and put stress on their joints are more likely to develop tendonitis. This can include: 36 37 Athletes, including anyone playing sport or exercising Dancers Military recruits (for ITBS) Musicians Carpenters Welders Cooks Butchers Adults in middle age are more at risk of developing tendonitis. Tendons become weakened during a lifetime, due to everyday activities. Additional stresses can cause tendonitis in weakened and age-damaged tendons. 23 38 Women tend to be more affected in certain types of tendinopathies, such as iliotibial band friction syndrome and sesamoiditis. A person with a history of tendonitis is at risk of developing tendonitis again.\n\nSmokers are considered to be 1.5 times more likely to develop tendonitis than non-smokers. Smoking can also negatively affect the healing process as the body repairs itself. 39 40\n\nTaking ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin , antibiotics in the fluoroquinolones class, may increase the risk of developing tendonitis or experiencing a tendon rupture. 41 42\n\nDiabetes and metabolic diseases, such as hyperparathyroidism and haemochromatosis, can lead to calcium deposits in the body, particularly around the shoulder area. This can irritate the tendons in the rotator cuff and cause tendonitis. This condition is known as acute calcific tendinitis.\n\nIf the bacteria that cause gonorrhea spread to the bloodstream and around the body, this creates a condition known as disseminated gonococcal infection. This condition usually causes tendonitis or joint pain as an early symptom.",
    "diagnosing_tendonitis": "Diagnosing tendonitis is usually done by taking the person’s medical history and performing a physical examination. During a physical examination, a healthcare professional will look for: Swelling Pain Tenderness Changes when the joint is moved If a diagnosis is not clear, or symptoms fail to improve, other tests may be ordered. The type of test will depend on the location of the injury, such as: 2 20 43 44 X-ray, which does not show tendons, but can reveal abnormalities with bones that indicate tendon problems Ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create an image of a joint MRI, which uses magnets and radio waves to look inside the body, does show tendons and can be useful if surgery is needed",
    "treatment_for_tendonitis": "There are various treatments for tendonitis which can reduce immediate pain and inflammation and also repair the tendon in the long run.\n\nThere are some simple treatments for non-severe tendonitis that do not involve pharmaceutical intervention.\n\nRest is necessary to allow the tendon to heal. It is important to reduce activities and, if possible, stop those which make the pain worse. When experiencing tendonitis, it may be necessary to rest the joint for three to six months, or potentially more, depending on the severity of the injury. There are no set recommendations for the duration of rest, but people should restrict painful activities for as long as necessary. 45 Wearing a brace, splint or strap may help keep the joint from being used. A sling may be helpful for shoulder tendonitis.\n\nCooling a swollen and painful joint with ice is a common home remedy for tendonitis. Ice can numb the skin and provide short-term pain relief in the first 24-48 hours if the condition first occurs as a sudden injury. 45 However, there is a lack of evidence to show whether using ice is helpful for long-term tissue repair. Cryotherapy can be used to treat acute flares of iliotibial band syndrome. 46\n\nPhysical therapy to reduce stress on tendons by strengthening surrounding muscles may be helpful for tendonitis conditions such as tennis elbow and Achilles tendonitis and iliotibial band syndrome. A physiotherapist can identify the best exercises for a particular injury, such as gentle stretches and strengthening exercises. 10 12 47 Strengthening and stretching exercises should not be attempted until after the pain has gone. Exercises that focus on lengthening muscles, known as eccentric training, can be beneficial for tendonitis. 45 Physical therapy can help the healing process and make future episodes of tendonitis less likely. Physiotherapy will also typically be recommended to strengthen joints after any surgery.\n\nSome practitioners offer ultrasound or Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment for tendonitis. However, there is no evidence that these treatments offer any benefit over placebo or standard care plans of rest and physical therapy. 45\n\nPain-killing medication may be useful in the short term to manage the pain of tendonitis. Medication should be used to ease any pain felt while resting the joint as it heals. Any attempt to mask pain while continuing with activity will risk damaging the tendon further. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, can help where the tendon is swollen. However, not all cases of tendonitis are inflammatory and may instead be caused by degeneration of the tendon. In such cases, painkillers such as paracetamol may be as effective. 48 A doctor will be able to advise on the most appropriate option. Painkillers should only be taken for a limited period of time.\n\nCorticosteroid injections into the site of tendonitis can provide short-term pain relief. Injections are administered by a health professional and can offer relief from pain for up to 48 hours . 49 50 Injections of corticosteroids should never be given to the heel as they are thought to increase the chance of Achilles tendon rupture. Ruptures of the Achilles tendon have been reported after a single use of corticosteroid injections. Repeated injections into the same site or into a tendon should be avoided as this can also increase the risk of tendon rupture. In cases of sesamoiditis treatment, fractures and necrosis should be excluded before administration of a local injection. 51 45\n\nTendonitis that does not respond to rest, painkillers or physical therapy may be referred for surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and severity of the condition. Types of surgery that may be suggested include: 10 24 52 53 Debridement and repair, which is the removal of damaged parts of the tendon. This is performed if less than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. Debridement with tendon transfer, which is performed when more than 50 percent of the tendon is damaged. The remaining tendon is supported with tendon tissue moved from elsewhere in the body. In Achilles surgery, for example, tendon tissue is taken from the big toe. Releasing the sheath or pulley, which is performed for De Quervain’s tendonitis and other tendonitis conditions of the hand and wrist, where a mechanical problem is preventing the tendon from functioning normally. In cases of sesamoiditis, surgical removal of the sesamoid bones may help in difficult cases. It is a  controversial approach due to the implications in the biomechanics and mobility of the foot. Surgery for tendonitis is rare, as cases usually improve with rest and non-surgical treatment. 2",
    "complications": "If tendonitis is left untreated, the affected tendons may rupture. A rupture occurs when the tendon partially or completely tears away from the bone. Without treatment, a tendon rupture could result in permanent disability. 2 54",
    "preventing_tendonitis": "The risk of tendonitis, or how severe tendonitis is when it occurs, can be lowered by: 2 20 55 Warming up and stretching before exercising Avoiding using joints in a repetitive motion as much as possible Strengthening muscles with exercise to provide support to joints and tendons Easing into new, strenuous activity Providing padding or cushioning for joints at risk of tendonitis Maintaining good posture to keep joints in the correct position Not continuing with activities that cause pain Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes (in case of sesamoiditis) Shoe modification and foot orthosis (for ITBS and sesamoiditis) Being consistent with the treatment plan.",
    "tendonitis_faqs": "Q: Are tendonitis and tennis elbow the same thing? A: Tennis elbow is a form of tendonitis called lateral epicondylitis. It is caused by overuse of the tendons on the outside of the elbow. (See Causes of tendonitis.) Q: How do you cure tendonitis? A: Unless the tendonitis is severe enough to need surgery, time, rest and physiotherapy exercises should be enough to heal it. How long a person needs to rest and what will help the process, depends on how damaged the tendon is. (See Treatment for tendonitis.) Q: How do I ease the pain of tendonitis? A: If possible, reduce use of the joint that has tendonitis and rest it. A brace or splint can help stop the joint moving while it heals. If pain persists, painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol can help for a short period of time. Putting ice on the joint can also provide temporary relief. Severe pain in some joints can be treated with corticosteroid injections. (See Treatment for tendonitis.) Q: Can tendonitis go away? Tendonitis can go away if the affected joint is rested. Continuing with activities that put strain on the affected tendon will not allow the tissue to heal, and risks making the condition worse."

    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/testicular-cancer/",
    "what_is_testicular_cancer": "Testicular cancer is a rare cancer that arises from the testicles. The testicles are male reproductive organs within the scrotum (scrotal sac) that produce sperm and the male hormone, testosterone . It is the most common cancer in young men between ages 15 and 35. The most common symptoms of testicular cancer are a painless lump or swelling in either testicle and a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. However the cancer may show no symptoms. Surgical removal of the cancer is the primary treatment. Other treatment options are generally based on the stage of testicular cancer. Many people recover well after treatment for testicular cancer.",
    "risks": "Cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably. These cells destroy the healthy cells around them and can spread into other parts of the body. Testicular cancer occurs when this takes place in the testicle. Although testicular cancer is one of the less common cancers overall, it is one of the most common solid cancers in men between the ages of 20 and 35. Older men and younger boys also can get this cancer, but this is less common. The cause of testicular cancer is not known. Men who have a family member who has had testicular cancer may be more likely to also develop testicular cancer. Men with HIV , who had an undescended testicle as a child (a condition where the testicle is not in the scrotum) or who have a chromosomal condition called Klinefelter syndrome also have a higher risk of developing testicular cancer.",
    "testicular_cancer_symptoms": "The most common symptoms is a painless lump or swelling affecting the testicle. Other symptoms include a feeling of heaviness, pain or swelling of the scrotum (the muscular bag which holds the testicles). Some people feel the pain and heaviness in the lower part of their abdomen. Some men may develop breast tissue, but this is uncommon.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is made based on the physical examination of the scrotum, blood tests and a ultrasound scan of the scrotum and CT scan of the abdomen. The diagnosis is confirmed when a small sample (biopsy) of the testicle shows cancer. Further scans and tests may be done to see if the cancer has spread.",
    "treating_testicular_cancer": "Treatment depends on the size of the cancer, the specific type of cancer, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body. This determines the stage of the cancer. In most cases, the cancer and affected testicle will be surgically removed. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are chosen depending on the stage and type of testicular cancer. The treating doctor can give the best advice in individual cases. These treatments can cause infertility. If the man would like to have children in the future, sperm banking before treatment is an option. Emotional support via individual counseling or a support group is helpful in coming to terms with the diagnosis and while undergoing treatment.",

    "condition": "Testicular Torsion",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/testicular-torsion/",
    "what_is_testicular_torsion": "Testicular torsion describes a condition in which a testicle becomes twisted within the scrotum, causing the blood supply to the testicle to become blocked. WIthout sufficient blood flow, the testicle can die due to lack of oxygen and, in severe cases, may need to be removed. 1 Therefore, suspected testicular torsion should be treated as a medical emergency. Newborns, children and adolescents are most often affected, although it can occur at any age and without warning. The most common symptom of testicular torsion is sudden pain on one side of the scrotum, sometimes accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis of testicular torsion is usually based on a physical examination and ultrasound of the scrotum. The treatment is surgery to untwist the testicle and reposition it within the scrotal sac. Surgery should take place as soon as possible to prevent permanent damage to the testicle. With early diagnosis and surgery, most people make a full recovery.",
    "symptoms": "The most common initial symptom or sign of testicular torsion is sudden and severe testicular pain. Typically, the pain only occurs on one side of the scrotum. This is because usually only one testicle at a time is affected. Torsion in both testes only affects roughly 2 in 100 men with the condition. 2 Although the pain tends to be most severe in the affected testicle, the lower abdomen may also become tender and painful. Following the onset of pain, affected people may also experience a number of other symptoms, including: 1 2 3 Nausea and vomiting Swelling of the scrotum Abnormal changes to the color of the scrotum, in particular redness or darkening Abnormal changes to the position of the testicle, including elevation or lying at an unusual angle The need to urinate frequently Fever In most cases of testicular torsion, long-term damage can be avoided if the condition is treated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. 4 It is an emergency condition, so always contact a doctor immediately if testicular torsion is suspected. Some people may experience severe, but temporary, testicular pain which lasts for just a few minutes. This can be the result of the testicle twisting, but returning back to normal of its own accord. 5 Even if short-term, any sharp pain or discomfort in the testes is a sign that medical help should be sought right away.",
    "causes": "Testicular torsion occurs when a testicle moves freely within the scrotum, twisting the spermatic cord that it is attached to. When the spermatic cord becomes twisted, blood flow between the abdomen and the affected testicle becomes restricted. A testicle without blood supply can quickly become damaged and, if blood flow is not restored in time, may die. 1 Most cases of testicular torsion occur in people who are born with a condition called bell clapper deformity. 6 This condition means the testicle is not adequately attached to the scrotal wall and hangs freely, resulting in a predisposition to rotation. Bell clapper deformity is only present in about 12 percent of men. 7 However, testicular torsion can still occur in people without bell clapper deformity. Tissues connecting the testes to the scrotum usually prevent the testes from rotating. In some people these surrounding tissues are too loose, which can result in a greater level of testicular movement and the risk of torsion occurring.",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_testicular_torsion": "Testicular torsion is not a common condition, with roughly only 1 in 4,000 people under the age of 25 experiencing it annually. 8 A number of factors can increase the risk of it occurring, such as: 3 4 6 9 10 Age. Testicular torsion is most common in adolescents between 12 to 18 years of age. Newborn babies and toddlers are also more likely to experience the condition. It is rare over the age of 30. Genetics. A family history of testicular torsion, or bell clapper deformity, increases the chances of experiencing the condition. Previous testicular torsion: People who have been previously affected by the condition are more likely to encounter it again. Exercise. Strenuous exercise and movement can result in increased chance of the testicle twisting. Trauma. In rare cases, testicular torsion may occur after an injury to the scrotum. Climate. Testicular torsion can occur when cold weather causes the already-twisted testicle to suddenly contract, trapping the twist in place. Good to know: Although there are established risk factors, testicular torsion can occur spontaneously without the presence of any risk factors at all. 4 If testicular torsion is suspected, always contact a doctor immediately.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is often suspected based on the symptoms and appearance of the scrotum. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with an ultrasound scan or, very commonly, during emergency surgery. Urine and blood tests may also be done to exclude any other cause for the symptoms.",
    "treatment": "Treatment is a surgical procedure to untwist the testicle and fix it to the scrotum. If the testicle has been severely damaged, it will be removed.",
    "prevention": "Although it is not possible to prevent testicular torsion, good surgical management can prevent the testicle from becoming twisted again."

Tetanus is sometimes called lockjaw, because the jaw muscles are commonly affected in the early stages. This bacteria lives in soil and can enter the body through breaks in the skin. This is a rare condition that can affect any person who is not vaccinated against tetanus, and tends to most commonly occur in older people who have not kept up with booster vaccinations. The typical symptoms of this condition are muscle stiffness, fever, sweating and painful muscular spasms. The diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and physical exam in a person who is at risk. Treatment includes antibiotics and antibodies (proteins which fight infection) against the tetanus bacteria and the tetanus toxin. Tetanus can be a life-threatening condition if not treated appropriately.",

It enters the body through cuts, scrapes, body piercings, deep wounds and other injuries which break the skin. When in the body, the bacteria begins to grow, and produces a toxin (a harmful substance) which affects the nerves and muscles, causing the symptoms of tetanus. Tetanus can affect any person who is not vaccinated, but tends to most commonly affect older people, who have not kept up with booster vaccinations. Since routine vaccination was introduced, tetanus has become an uncommon condition.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptoms are muscle stiffness, fever, sweating and painful muscle spasms. These muscle spasms can cause swallowing and breathing problems. Other symptoms may include a racing heart, dizziness, drooling and a loss of control of the bladder and bowel.",

    "treatment": "Tetanus is treated with antibiotics and antibodies (proteins which fight infection) against the tetanus bacteria and the tetanus toxin. If the tetanus is beginning to cause breathing or blood pressure problems, these also require immediate treatment. Other treatments may include muscle-relaxing medications. In case of severe infection, patients are usually admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and get support to breathing with the help of a ventilator.",
    "prevention": "Tetanus can be prevented by vaccination. Booster vaccinations are needed every 10 years.

    "condition": "Thalassemia",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/thalassemia/",
    "what_is_thalassemia": "People with thalassemia do not produce enough hemoglobin , a protein that binds to iron within red blood cells and helps circulate oxygen throughout the body. Low hemoglobin and low red blood cell count can lead to symptoms of anemia such as fatigue and shortness of breath. People with thalassemia may also develop other health problems, such as slow growth, facial bone deformities and an enlarged spleen, liver or heart. 1 Read more about hemoglobin levels » Thalassemia is an umbrella term for a group of genetic disorders involving defects in the proteins that make up hemoglobin. Normal hemoglobin has four protein chains, two known as alpha globin and two known as beta globin. The two main types of thalassemia, alpha and beta, are named after hereditary defects in these protein chains. Each of these types has further subtypes. Read more about the causes of thalassemia » Depending on which part of the hemoglobin protein is affected, thalassemia can vary from a mild condition to a serious or life-threatening condition that requires long-term treatment and management. Thalassemia is not caused by any environmental factors, and it is not possible to catch it. 2 The disorder is most common in people of Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin. 3",
    "symptoms": "The symptoms of thalassemia are wide-ranging and vary according to the type of thalassemia a person has. Those with thalassemia trait, also known as thalassemia carriers, will usually have no symptoms, or possibly mild anemia. Symptoms of thalassemia may include: 1 2\n\nAnemia refers to a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. It develops in almost everyone with thalassemia major and other serious types of the disorder. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening. Anemia results in a lack of oxygen being available to the body. Typical symptoms include: Tiredness and lethargy Breathlessness Faintness Headaches Read more about Anemia »\n\nMost people with thalassemia major or other severe types of the disorder will be at risk for what is known as iron overload. This is a possible side-effect of repeated blood transfusions, a necessary part of treatment for people with severe thalassemia. However, it can also occur on its own. Excessive levels of iron in the body can cause: 4 Heart problems Hormone problems, including diabetes, thyroid , adrenal and pituitary disorders Liver cirrhosis Delayed puberty in children\n\nAs a genetic disorder, thalassemia is present from birth, but will generally not begin to cause symptoms immediately. Children born with beta thalassemia major usually develop symptoms a few months after birth. Less severe cases may not cause any noticeable symptoms until later in childhood, or sometimes until adulthood. Early signs and symptoms that may indicate the presence of thalassemia in babies include: 5 Fatigue, fussiness and irritability Shortness of breath Pale skin Yellow skin and eyes, known as jaundice Protruding abdomen Dark urine Facial bone deformities Slow growth If you think you or your child may have thalassemia, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "Genes contain the instructions needed to make proteins in the body. Genes come in pairs, with one set inherited from the mother and one set inherited from the father. For the hemoglobin protein, two normal genes – one from each parent – are required to make healthy beta chains. If a person inherits two faulty beta thalassemia genes, that person will develop beta thalassemia major, also known as Cooley’s disease. Babies with this condition will often seem healthy at first, but usually develop symptoms of thalassemia within the first two years of life. It is typically a serious and lifelong condition, requiring long-term treatment and management. If a person inherits only one faulty beta thalassemia gene they will have beta thalassemia trait and become a carrier of thalassemia disease. They will generally be healthy or sometimes have mild anemia. However, they are at risk of passing on more severe thalassemia to their children. Thalassemia intermedia is used to describe the disorder that occurs when a person has inherited two faulty beta genes, but the faults are less severe than in beta thalassemia major. People with this condition usually have moderately severe anemia and sometimes require blood transfusions. Four normal genes – two from each parent – are required to make healthy alpha chains, so alpha thalassemia involves four potentially faulty genes, rather than just two. A person who inherits one or two faulty alpha genes will have alpha thalassemia trait, meaning they are a thalassemia carrier, but do not themselves experience symptoms, except sometimes slight anemia. If they inherit three faulty alpha thalassemia genes, they will develop hemoglobin H disease, with moderate to severe symptoms. With four faulty genes, alpha thalassemia major will occur, characterized by hydrops fetalis, in which excess fluid builds up in a baby’s body before birth, along with other physical abnormalities. Untreated alpha thalassemia major is almost always fatal, with a baby dying before delivery or shortly after birth. However, it can be diagnosed prenatally, and, if treatment is begun before the baby is born, they can survive. 6 A specialist team will counsel the family about what treatment options may be suitable for their baby. Women who are pregnant with babies that have inherited alpha thalassemia can also experience serious complications, including dangerously high blood pressure, premature delivery, and abnormal bleeding. 7",
    "how_thalassemia_is_diagnosed": "Thalassemia is normally diagnosed following blood tests. To make the diagnosis, a blood sample will be taken and analyzed in order to establish what type of hemoglobin is present. Occasionally, if the results prove inconclusive or there is any uncertainty, DNA tests may also be carried out. 8 Read more about Blood Test Results » Other conditions may present with similar symptoms, such as iron deficiency , vitamin B12 deficiency , erythropoietin deficiency, a bone marrow disorder called Diamond-Blackfan syndrome, and acute leukemia. It is important to identify the cause of a person’s symptoms, as each condition has different clinical consequences and treatment considerations. For instance, iron-deficiency anemia is usually treated with iron supplements, but it can be harmful for a person with thalassemia to take extra iron. Moderate and severe thalassemias are usually diagnosed in early childhood, because the symptoms, such as severe anemia, will occur within the first few years of life. Those who have milder forms might be diagnosed after a routine blood test shows anemia. A doctor may suspect thalassemia if a person is a member of an ethnic group that is at increased risk. 9 If you think you or your child may have thalassemia, try the Ada app for a free symptom assessment.\n\nIt is possible to find out if an unborn child is affected by thalassemia. This is usually done using tissue from the placenta, or amniotic fluid from the sac surrounding the embryo, and can be carried out from around 8 to 10 weeks into the course of a pregnancy . 5 Blood tests can show whether a couple both have thalassemia trait, and if a future child could therefore inherit thalassemia.\n\nIf thalassemia is present, it will often be detected in a newborn baby as part of routine postnatal screening processes in many countries. A blood sample will be collected from a simple heel prick and sent to a laboratory for testing. If the results return positive for thalassemia, the parents will have treatment options explained to them. Postnatal tests will also be able to show whether or not a newborn has thalassemia trait. This is important, as it may increase the chances of a future sibling or the child’s future children inheriting the disorder. 1",
    "treatment": "A number of treatment methods are available to manage the symptoms of thalassemia and prevent complications. However, the disorder usually cannot be cured, and will require lifelong treatment in cases of thalassemia major or intermedia. People with thalassemia major will be treated by a specialist and will be asked to attend check-ups at regular intervals. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is an important principle of managing thalassemia. This will typically involve: 2 Avoiding tobacco and excess alcohol to keep the bones and heart healthy Regular exercise to help strengthen bones and reduce the risk of osteoporosis Good nutrition and supplements to help prevent common deficiencies seen in people with thalassemia, such as taking folic acid to aid the body in its production of red blood cells, and calcium and vitamin D for bone health. Thalassemia minor is often mistaken for iron-deficiency anemia and treated with iron supplements. However, people with anemia from thalassemia trait should not take iron supplements unless a blood test shows they have coexistent iron deficiency. Besides these general principles above, there are two main treatments for thalassemia: Blood transfusions Chelation treatment\n\nBlood transfusions are typically given to people with anemia accompanied by other complications, such as poor growth, enlarged spleen, or evidence of heart disease, as well as in the case of pregnancy. 10 Blood transfusions have associated risks and are only carried out when absolutely necessary, so those who have anemia without other symptoms may be advised against a transfusion. 11 Blood transfusions supply normal red blood cells to the affected person. This corrects the anemia temporarily, improving health and helping children to grow normally. However, the red blood cells have a limited lifespan, so the transfusion is normally repeated every three or four weeks.\n\nPeople with moderate to severe thalassemia can experience iron building up to unhealthy levels in the body. This happens partly because of blood transfusions, but also because thalassemia causes the body to absorb more iron than normal from food. This can cause damage to internal organs and other potentially life-threatening complications. Chelation treatment gets rid of excess iron from the body. Medication is given orally or via a drip. Once in the bloodstream, the chemical properties of the medication allow it to bind to excess iron. The medication and excess iron is then excreted from the body in urine or stools. Chelation therapy is usually begun within a year or two of beginning blood transfusions. 12\n\nA stem cell transplant is a possible cure for thalassemia, though there are risks of serious complications and even mortality. Stem cell transplants tend to have a better outcome in younger people. 13 This therapy may be considered for a person who has a suitable donor. A stem cell transplant involves the administration of high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate thalassemia-producing cells in the bone marrow, and subsequent replacement with normal blood-making cells from a donor, resulting in a lifelong cure if successful.",
    "complications": "There are various complications that can occur as a result of thalassemia. These may include:\n\nChildren and adolescents with thalassemia may experience unusual bone growth as the bone marrow expands to try and make more blood cells, such as: An enlarged forehead or cheeks Thinning of the bones, known as osteoporosis Puberty may be delayed or progress abnormally in teenagers with thalassemia, due to iron build up impairing the function of the pituitary gland. This may lead to complications such as: Absence of menstruation, known as amenorrhea Diminished functioning of the sex organs, known as hypogonadism Short stature Doctors will monitor childhood development closely and may suggest hormone replacement therapy where necessary. 14\n\nAnemia can cause the spleen to become enlarged, which, through various mechanisms, may actually make the anemia even worse. Some people with thalassemia will need to have an operation to remove their spleen. The spleen is a key part of the immune system and, if it is removed, a person will need immunizations and daily antibiotics to protect against certain infections such as pneumonia and meningitis. 15\n\nOther possible complications include: 2 Reduced fertility Blood transfusion complications, such as immune reactions and transmission of hepatitis Chelation complications, affecting the blood, liver, kidneys, vision, hearing and bones Infections Gallstones see symptomatic cholelithiasis",
    "other_names_for_thalassemia": "Hb Barts Hemoglobin (Hb) Barts Hydrops Fetalis Syndrome (BHFS) Homozygous α0-thalassemia major Homozygous α-thalassemia 1 Alpha thalassemia minor Silent alpha thalassemia carrier Hemoglobin H disease (HbH disease)\n\nCooley’s anemia Beta-zero (ß0) thalassemia Beta-plus (ß+) thalassemia Mediterranean anemia Beta thalassemia minor (beta thalassemia trait) Beta thalassemia intermedia",
    "faqs": "Q: Alpha vs beta thalassemia – what are the main differences between them? A: Thalassemia is an umbrella term that includes several diseases, all caused by a defect in the production of hemoglobin, the protein that enables red blood cells to carry oxygen. Normal hemoglobin has two alpha globin and two beta globin protein chains. Alpha and beta thalassemia are named after hereditary defects in these protein chains. In their minor form, both alpha and beta thalassemia cause no symptoms, or only mild anemia. However, in their major forms, alpha is almost always fatal before birth, whereas beta is not immediately fatal because some production of healthy hemoglobin is still possible. However, without treatment there is severe anemia, and possible complications involving the bones, liver, spleen and heart. Q: Can thalassemia be cured? A: Stem cell transplantation is a possible cure for the condition. This involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate thalassemia-producing cells in the marrow, and subsequent replacement with normal blood-making cells from a donor, resulting in a lifelong cure if successful. However, there are potentially serious risks associated with stem cell transplantation, such as infection, organ failure, and even death. The level of risk depends on certain factors, including age of the patient, adequacy of previous chelation, and liver health. 13 Q: What is sickle cell thalassemia? A: Sickle cell thalassemia, also known as sickle beta thalassemia is an inherited condition that affects hemoglobin. It occurs when the affected person has inherited a sickle-cell gene from one parent and a beta-thalassemia gene from the other. Sickle beta thalassemia may lead to anemia, repeated infections and frequent episodes of pain. 16 Read more about Sickle Cell Disease » Q: What is the meaning of thalassemia? A: Thalassemia is from the Greek word thalassa, meaning sea, and emia, from haema, meaning blood. It was named this, because the condition was first described in people living near the Mediterranean sea. Thalassemia is usually found in warmer areas such as the Mediterranean basin. This is because those areas also had a lot of malaria , and thalassemia provides some immunity to it, giving an evolutionary benefit to thalassemia carriers. 17"

    "condition": "Thyroiditis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/thyroiditis/",
    "overview": "The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland found in the lower neck , just beneath the Adam’s apple. The hormones this gland releases control the body’s growth and metabolism. They affect processes like heart rate, digestion and temperature. Thyroid hormones are also essential for healthy mental and physical development. 1 2 When the levels of thyroid hormone are too high, symptoms of hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) may present , such as increased heart rate, weight loss and anxiety. Conversely, when the levels are abnormally low, there may be symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) , like fatigue, weight gain and depression .",
    "what_is_thyroiditis": "Thyroiditis is a term for inflammation of the thyroid gland , a condition which causes the levels of thyroid hormone in the body to go beyond the normal range. Thyroiditis can be caused by several clinical disorders that present in different ways and require different courses of treatment, ranging from medication to surgery. The most common types of thyroiditis include Hashimoto’s thyroiditis , postpartum thyroiditis and De Quervain’s thyroiditis. Women are far more likely than men to experience thyroid problems. 3 Thyroiditis can be a serious condition, and requires management by a doctor.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms of thyroiditis depend on whether the levels of thyroid hormone in the blood are too high (hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis) or too low (hypothyroidism). Good to know: Some of the symptoms may occur in both hyper- and hypothyroidism. If you think that you might have signs of a thyroid disorder, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.\n\nAnxiety or nervousness Irritability Increased sweating Heat intolerance Weight loss or difficulty gaining weight, despite a good appetite Insomnia (sleeplessness or sleep disturbances) Racing heart or palpitations (pronounced awareness of one’s heartbeat) 4 High blood pressure 5 Increased frequency of bowel movements Nausea and vomiting 6 Fatigue (generally feeling tired or weak) Tremors (shaky hands) Feeling of weakness in the muscles (particularly in the upper arms and thighs) Difficulty exercising Eye bulging and irritation Light or no menstruation Some people may experience weight gain due to increased appetite in hyperthyroidism. 7 8 9 10 11\n\nFatigue (generally feeling tired or weak) Depression Forgetfulness Sensitivity to cold Dry skin Poor exercise tolerance Constipation Unexplained weight gain Brittle nails Hair loss Tongue enlargement (swelling) In addition, there may be menstrual irregularities. 12 13 14\n\nPeople affected by thyroiditis may present with a goiter – the medical term for an enlarged thyroid gland . There may be noticeable swelling in the lower part of the neck. Goiters can be related to hyper or hypothyroidism, as well as thyroid nodules and a number of other conditions that affect the thyroid. Thyroid goiters are usually painless, but can cause a tight feeling in the throat, hoarseness, coughing, and difficulty swallowing and breathing (if they are very large). A goiter does not necessarily indicate that thyroid function has been compromised, and small thyroid goiters may not require medical treatment. 15",
    "types": "There are a number of different types of thyroiditis. Many of these thyroid problems seem to run in families, and they tend to affect a higher number of women than men. 3\n\nAlso known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or disease - sometimes written as Hashimoto thyroiditis - is the most common type of thyroiditis . It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing inflammation and gradual damage that can lead to hypothyroidism over time. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is more prevalent among women than men , and is commonly associated with a family history of thyroid disease. 16 Hashimoto’s thyroiditis tends to progress slowly and can take months or even years to be detected. 1 Those affected may present with a painless goiter, symptoms of hypothyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. Though less common, there may also be symptoms of hyperthyroidism. In some cases, the disease may begin with a period of hyperthyroidism, which leads to hypothyroidism as the thyroid gland becomes damaged. The hypothyroidism, which is often lifelong, is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Sometimes, periods of thyroid over- and underactivity may alternate over the course of the disease. Regular monitoring and blood tests can help a person manage any thyroid hormone fluctuations that occur. 16 Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is sometimes associated with other autoimmune conditions, including Addison’s disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anemia, celiac disease and connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis . For more information, see the dedicated page on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.\n\nAlso known as Ord’s disease, this autoimmune condition is characterized by atrophy of the thyroid gland and hypothyroidism. It is very similar to Hashimoto’s disease, apart from the shrinking of the thyroid gland instead of the development of a goiter . Ord’s disease and Hashimoto’s disease have historically been classified as separate disorders, but research suggests that they may instead be different manifestations of autoimmune thyroiditis, with some medical practitioners calling for the combined term Ord-Hashimoto’s disease to be used. 17\n\nAlso known as painless thyroiditis or subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, this is an autoimmune disease (autoimmune meaning that the immune system attacks healthy cells) that presents with an initial period of hyperthyroidism (three months or less), followed by temporary hypothyroidism. Silent thyroiditis generally resolves on its own within 12-18 months, 1 though in some cases the hypothyroidism may occasionally be permanent. Treatment may include beta-blockers to relieve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone replacement, when necessary, in the hypothyroid phase.\n\nSometimes classified as a type of silent thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis is a type of thyroiditis after pregnancy that affects people who have recently (within the last 12 months) given birth, or had a miscarriage, or medical abortion. 18 The condition is autoimmune in nature and typically manifests with an initial period of hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism that may be temporary or permanent. Not all people experience both phases. 1 Postpartum thyroiditis most often affects people with a prior history of thyroid dysfunction, and resembles Hashimoto’s thyroiditis – as does regular silent thyroiditis. They are considered variants of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. 19\n\nSome medications may cause hypothyroidism or, more rarely, hyperthyroidism. Treatment with lithium is known to cause hypothyroidism in 5-15 percent of people and goiter in up to 37 percent. 20 Iodine and iodine-containing medications , such as amiodarone, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon, can also affect thyroid function. 21 Drugs used to treat hyperthyroidism can result in a hypothyroid state, and vice versa, if dosages are incorrect for a particular person. Treatment requires management of medications and dosages with a doctor.\n\nSometimes also called Riedel’s struma or invasive fibrous thyroiditis, this is an extremely rare type of thyroiditis . The cause is unclear, though it is thought to be either an autoimmune or primary fibrotic (referring to an excessive build-up of connective tissue) disorder. Riedel’s thyroiditis typically presents with a hard, painless mass in the front of the neck . As the disease progresses, affected people may experience hoarseness, difficulty swallowing and breathing, as well as choking. There may also be hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, thyroid hormone replacement and surgery. 22 23\n\nAlso known as painful subacute thyroiditis, subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis, giant cell thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, this is a relatively rare condition that mostly affects middle-aged women who have recently had a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract . Overall, De Quervain’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of a painful thyroid gland . The main symptoms of De Quervain’s thyroiditis are fever, pain in the throat and thyroid region of the neck (which may radiate to the jaw and ears) and an enlarged thyroid gland . Initially, a person with De Quervain’s may present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, as the condition causes the release of high levels of thyroid hormone. This is sometimes followed by a temporary (transient) phase of hypothyroidism. De Quervain’s thyroiditis is usually self-limiting, with the condition clearing on its own within a few months. Treatment is aimed at minimizing pain and discomfort, and aspirin or another NSAID (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug), such as ibuprofen may be recommended. In severe cases, a corticosteroid may be prescribed as a potent anti-inflammatory measure. A beta-blocker may be given to ease some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, like a racing heart, high blood pressure, feeling agitated or having tremors. Antithyroid medication is not usually necessary. The temporary hypothyroidism that is often the last stage of the condition, before patients recover, may necessitate short-term treatment with thyroid hormone replacement. Thyroid function generally returns to normal (a euthyroid state), though in a few cases De Quervain’s can recur and result in permanent hypothyroidism. 24\n\nA number of people who undergo radioactive iodine therapy for hyperthyroidism, develop radiation-induced thyroiditis after the procedure. Radiation therapy for certain cancers, such as lymphoma, head and neck cancers, can also trigger thyroiditis. 25 Those affected may present with symptoms of hyper or hypothyroidism, ref1 as well as tenderness in the thyroid area. Treatment may involve beta-blockers to alleviate symptoms of temporary (transient) hyperthyroidism, painkillers ref17 and thyroid hormone replacement where necessary. 26\n\nThis very rare type of thyroiditis , also known as suppurative thyroiditis or acute thyroiditis (to be distinguished from subacute thyroiditis), is caused by an infection of the thyroid gland with bacteria or other microbes. The disease is associated with a weakened immune system that may be caused by any number of reasons or, in the case of children, an abnormality in the development of the thyroid gland . 1 Most people affected by acute infectious thyroiditis have a pre-existing thyroid disorder such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or thyroid cancer. 27 Symptoms include pain in the front of the neck, soreness in the throat, fever and a rapid heart rate . Thyroid hormone levels tend to be within the normal range. The cause of infection is typically determined using fine-needle aspiration (a type of biopsy), after which a treatment option will be prescribed. Most likely, this will require antibiotics or other antimicrobial agents and, in the case of an abscess, surgical drainage. Without effective and timely treatment, the condition can potentially be life-threatening. 28",
    "diagnosis": "A number of diagnostic methods may be used to confirm that thyroiditis or another thyroid condition is present, including blood tests and ultrasound scans.\n\nThyroiditis is typically diagnosed with a thyroid function test. This is a laboratory blood test that looks at levels of the following: 29 TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) FT4 (free thyroxine) FT3 (free triiodothyronine) – only occasionally The amount of thyroxine (the thyroid’s main hormone) secreted by the thyroid gland is regulated by the pituitary gland (also called the hypophysis, a small hormone gland located at the base of the brain). The pituitary gland secretes TSH according to the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that is needed. T4 is converted into T3 (triiodothyronine), which is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone. 29 If the level of TSH is high and the FT4 low in a thyroid blood test, it indicates hypothyroidism. Conversely, if the level of TSH is low and the FT4 high, hyperthyroidism is indicated. The ranges used vary slightly by country and lab. 29 Where the TSH level is slightly elevated, but the FT4 level is normal, subclinical or mild hypothyroidism is indicated. Because this may progress to full-blown hypothyroidism, follow-up tests may be recommended. 29 When autoimmune thyroiditis is suspected, a doctor may order further blood tests to see whether thyroid antibodies are present at levels above the reference range. These include thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) to confirm Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHR Ab), which are also called TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs), in the case of Graves’ disease. 29\n\nThis non-invasive test may be ordered to check the thyroid gland for swelling and nodules, and blood circulation pattern. An ultrasound is also used to check the parathyroid glands (four glands that are situated on the back of the thyroid and produce parathyroid hormone, which affects the body’s calcium metabolism). 30\n\nIn some cases (particularly when hyperthyroidism is present), a radioactive iodine uptake test may be recommended – often together with a thyroid scan (a specialized imaging procedure). In both of these tests, a small amount of a weak radioactive substance is administered. 31 A radioactive iodine uptake test allows the medical practitioner to determine whether the thyroid gland, which naturally takes up iodine, 32 is functioning normally, and why thyroid hormone levels may be out of range. A scan can detect thyroid nodules and inflammation. ref20\n\nIf a suspicious thyroid nodule is detected, a fine needle aspiration biopsy may be performed to determine whether it is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). 33",
    "thyroiditis_treatments": "Treatment depends on the type of thyroiditis , as well as its progression. Pain and inflammation caused by thyroiditis may be treated with aspirin, ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs), with the addition of corticosteroids where necessary.\n\nAn underactive thyroid is treated with thyroid hormone replacement. This usually takes the form of levothyroxine (a synthetic/lab-created form of T4), with the dosage determined by the severity of the hypothyroidism, as well as the weight and age of the affected person. Regular thyroid blood tests are necessary to ensure that the levels of thyroid hormone do not become too high (thyrotoxicosis) 34 or remain too low. 35\n\nAn overactive thyroid can be treated in a number of ways. There is no single preferred method – the chosen option usually depends on the type and severity of hyperthyroidism, as well as the age and general health of the affected person. Treatment methods include antithyroid drugs like methimazole, which block the ability of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone, radioactive iodine , which destroys the thyroid cells that produce thyroid hormone and thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy), where most of the thyroid gland is removed, and the resultant hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine. Beta-blockers may be prescribed to lessen the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, mainly fast heart rate and high blood pressure, while treatments are taking effect. 7 Because treatment will depend on the type of thyroiditis experienced, consultation with a medical professional is very important. Taking over-the-counter medication without advice from a healthcare provider is not recommended.",
    "other_thyroid_conditions": "Also known as diffuse toxic goiter and Basedow’s disease, Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid gland is stimulated to produce too much thyroid hormone , causing hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis. Like Hashimoto’s disease, it seems to have a genetic component and is more prevalent among women than men . Graves’ disease is one of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism . 34 People affected by Graves’ disease may present with painless enlargement of the thyroid gland, symptoms of hyperthyroidism and high levels of thyroid antibodies. In addition, there may be symptoms of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, where the eyes are affected by a gritty sensation, pain or pressure. There may also be swollen eyelids, light sensitivity, double vision or bulging eyes, among other symptoms. Graves’ ophthalmopathy is seen in approximately 30 percent of people affected by Graves’ disease. There may also be reddening and thickening of the skin, most often on the shins or tops of the feet. This is called Graves’ dermopathy 36 or pretibial myxedema, 37 and is rare. The hyperthyroidism is treated with antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery. Where permanent hypothyroidism results, levothyroxine is prescribed to replace the thyroid hormone and is typically taken for life. 34\n\nThyroid nodules are lumps in the thyroid gland . They may be solid or filled with fluid. Nodules may be too small to detect without a physical examination, thyroid ultrasound or thyroid scan, or large enough that they are visible and, in rare cases, even obstruct breathing or swallowing. 38 The majority of thyroid nodules do not cause any symptoms. However, some produce extra thyroxine, which can cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism as thyroid hormone levels go out of range. Thyroid nodules may be associated with iodine deficiency (rare in the United States, more common in many regions of Europe), overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue (thyroid adenomas) or Hashimoto’s disease, among other conditions. 39 40 A thyroid nodule may also be a sign of thyroid cancer. However, most thyroid nodules are benign (non-cancerous growths) . It is estimated that only two to three out of 20 thyroid nodules are cancerous. 41 If a thyroid nodule is non-cancerous (benign) and not causing any symptoms, treatment may not be necessary. A doctor may simply opt to perform regular examinations and thyroid function tests to monitor its progress. Large nodules, and those that cause symptoms, may be removed surgically or treated with radioactive iodine (if they are producing thyroxine). 42\n\nThyroid cancer is relatively rare , but rates seem to be increasing. It is thought that this is due to advances in technology which allow medical practitioners to detect small thyroid cancers that may previously have gone unnoticed. Most cases of thyroid cancer are treatable and can be cured , allowing those affected to live a normal life. 43 44 Early symptoms of thyroid cancer are rarely noticeable. However, in some cases, firm, painless nodules may be noted. Later symptoms may include rapid growth of a goiter, throat hoarseness or pain that does not go away, difficulty swallowing or breathing, pain in the front of the neck and an unexplained cough. 44 45 46 There are four main types of thyroid cancer: Papillary (the most common type) Follicular (the second most common type) Medullary (rare, may run in families) Anaplastic (rare, an aggressive type of thyroid cancer) Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer and may involve full (or, in rare cases, partial) removal of the thyroid gland during thyroid surgery, radioactive iodine therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Levothyroxine is prescribed to prevent hypothyroidism after treatment, and is taken for life. 44",
    "thyroiditis_faqs": "Q: Is there a special thyroid diet? A: There is no specific thyroid diet that is recommended for people affected by thyroid disorders. A healthy, balanced diet is generally sufficient. It is not advisable to take special supplements, including iodine preparations, without first consulting a doctor. Some foods and supplements can, however, interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine, so those taking this medication should keep in mind the following: After taking calcium-rich foods or supplements, wait four hours before taking levothyroxine After taking iron tablets, wait two hours before taking levothyroxine Wait as long as possible after taking levothyroxine before eating soya or soy products In addition, kelp and iodine supplements should be avoided unless otherwise recommended by a healthcare provider, as they can potentially aggravate thyroid disorders . A healthy, varied diet usually provides sufficient amounts of iodine. In many countries, where the normal diet contains too little iodine, table salt is iodized, meaning it has iodine added to it, to help prevent iodine deficiency from occurring. Vegetables of the Brassica family, such as cabbage, broccoli and kale, may be implicated in the development of a goiter in some people, but only in very rare cases where consumption is extremely high. It is not a problem under normal dietary conditions. 47 Q: What is thyroid hair loss? A: This is the phrase used to describe the loss of hair that may occur in severe, prolonged hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. The hair loss tends to affect the entire scalp, as opposed to small areas, and the hair may appear sparse. There may also be loss of eyebrow hair. Thyroid hair loss is unusual in mild thyroid disorders. The hair typically grows back once the thyroid disorder has been successfully treated. However, this may take a few months, and regrowth is not always complete. 48 Partial hair loss is listed as a possibility during the first few months of treatment with levothyroxine. 49 In rare cases, antithyroid drugs may also be associated with hair loss. ref36 Q: What precautions need to be taken with the thyroid in pregnancy ? A: Normal levels of thyroid hormone in an expectant mother are essential for the healthy development of the baby. People with pre-existing thyroid conditions may need to adjust the dosage of their medication during pregnancy, with regular thyroid function tests to ensure that their thyroid hormone levels are within the optimal range. In some parts of the world, such as Germany, pregnant women may be encouraged to take iodine supplements to compensate for deficiencies in the soil and the lack of fortification of food products. A doctor will be able to advise on whether supplementation is necessary. People who develop symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism while pregnant need to seek immediate medical care. If symptoms of postpartum thyroiditis are present after the delivery of the baby, the mother should consult with a doctor. Postpartum thyroiditis may be mistaken for postpartum depression . 8 Q: Can thyroiditis cause cancer? A: While thyroiditis itself does not cause cancer, some types of thyroiditis, e.g. Hashimoto’s disease , may be associated with an increase in a person’s risk of developing thyroid cancer and certain other types of cancer. 50 51 It is advisable to speak to a doctor about any cancer concerns you may have. Q: Can thyroiditis recur? A: Yes, thyroiditis can come back or return, meaning that the condition can occur more than once. A person may also experience repeat episodes of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism as a result of some types of thyroiditis. Q: Can thyroiditis cause a sore throat? A: Yes, a sore throat can be a sign of some types of thyroiditis, such as subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. See the dedicated sections above for more information. 52 53 Q: Can thyroiditis cause swollen lymph nodes? A: Swollen lymph nodes in the neck can be a sign of thyroiditis that is autoimmune in nature, e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis , as well as in acute infectious thyroiditis. However, swollen lymph glands can also be a sign of many other conditions. If you have swollen lymph nodes and other signs of a thyroid problem, it is advisable to consult a doctor. 54 55 Q: Can a thyroid nodule cause weight gain? A: Most thyroid nodules themselves do not affect a person’s weight. However, a thyroid nodule can be associated with Hashimoto’s disease, which is a thyroid condition that can lead to weight gain and other symptoms of hypothyroidism. Q: Do I have thyroiditis? A: If you think that you might have thyroiditis, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms, and consult a doctor."

    "diagnosis": "To establish the diagnosis of Tietze syndrome, other conditions that cause pain and swelling at the upper front chest may need to be ruled out first. 5 3 4 Doctors will have to take the person’s medical history and conduct a physical examination to identify the characteristics of the symptoms first. Furthermore, several tests such as electrocardiogram, medical imaging tests (e.g., X-ray, CT or MRI scans) or biopsies may be necessary to assess the extent of the symptoms and to exclude other causes. 6 Given that soft tissue swelling (a lump) is one of the hallmarks of Tietze syndrome, an ultrasound can be one of the most effective tools to assist in the diagnosis. 2\n\nThe most common differential diagnosis of Tietze Syndrome is costochondritis as they both present with front upper chest wall pain and discomfort. The pain in Tietze syndrome is usually localized within a smaller area and accompanied by swelling, whereas costochondritis usually presents as pain in multiple ribs without swelling around the damaged joints. 3 4",
    "tietze_syndrome_treatment": "The treatment of Tietze Syndrome aims to alleviate the pain and usually depends on the severity of discomfort. 2 3 4 Mild : symptoms are normally tolerable and can improve with rest. Moderate : if the pain becomes intolerable, taking painkillers such as acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen), or applying heat or an ice pack as directed by the doctors may be helpful. Severe : if painkillers are ineffective, an injection of local anesthetic or steroids may be needed.",
    "prognosis": "Generally speaking, the symptoms of Tietze syndrome go away after 1 or 2 weeks. Most people recover well without further complications. The long-term outlook is usually good without any complications. 2"

    "condition": "Tonsillitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/tonsillitis/",
    "what_is_tonsillitis": "Tonsillitis is an inflammatory condition of the tonsils, the two fleshy glands at the back of the throat. It can be caused by either a virus or, less commonly, a bacterial infection. The condition can affect people of any age, but is most common in children between 5 and 10 years of age. 1 The characteristic symptoms of tonsillitis are a sore throat and difficulty swallowing, though ear pain, headaches and fever, among other symptoms, may also occur. In most cases, the condition will clear up on its own after three to four days, without specific treatment. 2 If a bacterial infection is the cause, however, antibiotics may be prescribed. Tonsillitis itself is not contagious, but the infections that cause it often are. These include the same viruses that cause colds and flu , as well as the streptococcal bacteria that causes strep throat . For this reason, it is important for people with tonsillitis to stay away from other people as much as possible until the infection passes and to take extra care in practicing good hygiene, such as washing their hands often and covering their mouth and nose when sneezing. Generally, tonsillitis is considered a non-serious condition. In rare cases, however, its symptoms can become severe or complications can develop. If symptoms persist for more than four days or are particularly severe, medical attention should be sought as soon as possible. 3 People worried about the symptoms they are experiencing can also carry out a symptom assessment using the free Ada app .\n\nThere are three main types of tonsillitis: 4 Acute tonsillitis tends to last for between a few days and two weeks, with symptoms generally coming on quickly. Chronic tonsillitis is when the symptoms of the condition last continuously for a significant amount of time. Recurrent tonsillitis is when a person experiences multiple episodes of acute tonsillitis over the course of a year, generally five or more. 5 It is the duration for which symptoms are experienced and their frequency which differentiates the three types of tonsillitis. The symptoms themselves remain relatively consistent across all three types, though the severity may differ.",
    "symptoms": "The most common symptoms of tonsillitis include: 1 2 A sore throat Difficulty and/or pain when swallowing Foul smelling breath tender neck lymph nodes Fever A hoarse or lost voice Coughing Feeling sick Tiredness Pain in the ears Headache Upon inspection, the throat may also be red, while the tonsils may appear swollen and feature spots of white pus. Often, tonsillitis may also cause the lymph glands of the neck to become swollen and the affected person to experience exceptionally or newly onset bad breath. 2 These symptoms are more common in cases of chronic or recurrent tonsillitis. If symptoms persist for more than four days or are particularly severe, medical attention should be sought. The free Ada app can also be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The tonsils are the two big balls of lymphatic tissue at the side and towards the back of the throat, usually visible through the mouth. Their main function is to trap and process viruses and bacteria that have been inhaled and in doing so help the body to prevent or fight illness quickly. 6 However, the tonsils themselves are vulnerable to infection from both viruses and bacteria. When they become infected, tonsillitis occurs.\n\nThe majority of cases of tonsillitis are caused by a virus. A variety of virus types can cause the infection, with some of the most common including: 3 Rhinovirus, which can also cause the common cold Influenza virus Parainfluenza virus, which can also cause a kind of sore throat or pharyngitis without inflamed tonsils Enteroviruses, which may also cause, for example, hand, foot and mouth disease Adenoviruses, which can also cause, for example, diarrhea and pink eye Rubeola virus, which also causes measles Rarely, the Epstein-Barr virus, which also causes glandular fever These viruses are spread via the small droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Coming into direct contact and inhaling these droplets can pass on these viruses, as can coming into contact with the droplets via a contaminated surface or object.\n\nRoughly one in three cases of tonsillitis are caused by bacteria, with this being more common in children than adults. 7 A variety of different types of bacteria can cause tonsillitis, but the most common are group A streptococcus bacteria, which cause streptococcal pharyngitis, or strep throat, a kind of throat infection that often causes very inflamed tonsils. Read more about Strep Throat » Good to know: Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, tonsillitis and strep throat are not the same condition. Strep throat is one of a variety of causes of tonsillitis. Many people with tonsillitis do not have strep throat, but instead a viral tonsillitis infection caused by one of the viruses mentioned above. This is an important distinction to make, as it can impact the course of treatment. As a bacterial infection, strep throat can be treated with antibiotics, whereas tonsillitis caused by a viral infection will not get any better by taking antibiotics. This is the reason why they will not be prescribed.",
    "diagnosing_tonsillitis": "In many cases, tonsillitis will not require professional medical evaluation. If, however, symptoms persist for four days or longer, or they are particularly severe, making it difficult to eat or drink, for example, it is recommended that the affected person see a medical doctor. Good to know: In rare cases, extremely swollen tonsils can lead to difficulty breathing. This is a medical emergency requiring urgent medical attention. A doctor will typically be able to diagnose tonsillitis based upon an examination of the symptoms present. Generally, they will look inside the mouth, specifically at the tonsils, for signs of swelling and/or pus, and check to see if the glands of the neck are swollen. Sometimes a swab test of the throat may also be carried out. Less commonly, blood tests may be ordered, for example, if glandular fever is suspected.",
    "tonsillitis_treatment": "Most people will not require specific treatment for tonsillitis. In the majority of cases, symptoms will clear up in under a week, and antibiotics will not be required. There are, however, a number of ways in which the condition can be supportively managed at home.\n\nSome of the most commonly recommended self-care techniques for managing tonsillitis at home include: 2 3 Getting plenty of rest and staying home from work or school if necessary Drinking plenty of fluids; some people find that warm or chilled fluids provide the best relief Gargling with a solution of warm water and salt, which may provide some pain relief Taking over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol, making sure to follow the advice of the pharmacist or doctor and to read and follow the instructions provided within the packaging Sucking throat lozenges If symptoms persist for longer than four days, affected people are advised to visit a doctor for evaluation.\n\nAntibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. 8 If tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the infection will need to run its course naturally, although oral pain relievers and/or surface numbing agents, like lozenges containing benzocaine, may be prescribed. ref11 9 If the infection is caused by bacteria, antibiotics may be prescribed. If antibiotics are prescribed, it is important that the affected person reads the enclosed instructions thoroughly. It is also important that they take the entire prescribed course, even if symptoms clear up before this time. This helps to reduce the chances of building up resistance to the medication.\n\nPeople who experience recurrent tonsillitis may be advised by doctors to consider surgery to remove their tonsils completely, a procedure known as a tonsillectomy. The criteria to be considered for a tonsillectomy may vary, depending on where you live or your specific circumstances; in the UK for instance a person should have experienced: 10 Seven or more incidences of tonsillitis in the previous year, or Five or more incidences of tonsillitis in each of the previous two years, or Three or more incidences of tonsillitis in each of the previous three years Generally, the bouts of tonsillitis must also impact the day-to-day life of the affected person; requiring, for example, time off work or school. Surgical removal of the tonsils prevents further episodes of tonsillitis, but does not prevent the possibility of other types of throat infection or the possibility of a sore throat. A tonsillectomy is generally considered a minor procedure, though, as with all types of surgery, there are risks. These risks will be explained in full by the doctor or surgeon before surgery.",
    "tonsillitis_complications": "Tonsillitis generally leads to no further health problems. However, in some cases, complications can occur. Sometimes, the infection causing tonsillitis can also spread to other parts of the body, causing, for example, an ear infection , sinus infection or chest infection. Another complication of tonsillitis occurs when an abscess forms on or around the tonsils, a condition called a peritonsillar abscess or quinsy . Symptoms of quinsy may include: 2 7 10 11 12 Severe pain in the throat, which is usually worse on one side Muffled or “hot potato” voice Ear pain on one side upon swallowing Fever Neck pain and possibly decreased neck mobility Large, swollen neck lymph nodes Difficulty swallowing and/or difficulty opening the mouth Difficulty breathing Quinsy is usually treated with antibiotics, as well as a minor surgical procedure to drain the abscess of pus. People experiencing possible symptoms of quinsy should seek medical attention as a matter of urgency. If breathing is restricted, emergency care should be sought without delay. The free Ada app is also available to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "tonsillitis_prevention": "The best way to prevent tonsillitis is to attempt to limit exposure to the viral or bacterial infections that cause the condition. To do this, be sure to wash the hands thoroughly with water and soap throughout the day and avoid close contact with people displaying symptoms associated with tonsillitis, as well as conditions such as the common cold or the flu . People who have tonsillitis should avoid spreading the causing agent by staying home from work or school until the infection has passed and by maintaining proper hygiene. For further information on how to maintain good hygiene, take a look at this resource from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .",
    "tonsillitis_faqs": "Q: When should I see my doctor about tonsillitis? A: Generally, people experiencing symptoms of tonsillitis should seek medical attention if their symptoms do not subside in three to four days or if the following symptoms are present: 6 Severe throat pain Difficulty swallowing, breathing and/or opening the mouth; if you have difficulty taking in liquids, this is a matter of utmost urgency, and having difficulty breathing is an emergency that should be treated without any delay! Persistent fever Pain is located on one side of the throat When these symptoms occur, it could be a sign that it is a more complicated case of tonsillitis, possibly  needing additional treatment or a complication of tonsillitis may be present. Q: Are tonsillitis and strep throat the same thing? A: No, tonsillitis and strep throat, or streptococcal pharyngitis, are related but not the same. Both conditions can involve inflammation of the inside of the throat, but tonsillitis typically mainly affects the tonsils, while strep throat, a special type of sore throat, typically leads to inflammation of the entire back of the throat, often also including the tonsils. However, whereas strep throat is always caused by Streptococcus bacteria, tonsillitis can also be caused by other types of bacteria, as well as various viruses. Strep throat also involves a wider range of symptoms and is often more severe and longer lasting than tonsillitis. Q: What are the white spots on the tonsils which sometimes appear with tonsillitis? A: Although not all people with tonsillitis will develop white spots on their tonsils, some will, often in more severe cases of the condition. These white spots are pus. 6 They sometimes also have a yellowish color and usually disappear once the infection has passed. Q: Is tonsillitis contagious? A: Although tonsillitis itself is not contagious, the viral and bacterial infections that cause the condition often are. These include the infections that cause the common cold , the flu and strep throat . Q: What is the difference between tonsillitis and adenoiditis? A: The adenoids are glands located in the roof of the mouth, where the nose and the throat meet. Like the tonsils, the adenoids play a role in fighting infections, but can themselves sometimes become infected. If this happens, the adenoids become inflamed, and a condition known as adenoiditis results. The symptoms of adenoiditis can in some cases be confused with tonsillitis, but they are different conditions. Symptoms of adenoiditis may include noisy breathing, snoring and nasal speech, among others. Treatment may include antibiotics, or, in severe cases, the surgical removal of the adenoids through a procedure known as an adenoidectomy. 13 Q: What is the difference between tonsillitis and pharyngitis? A: Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx at the back of the throat and is often just simply referred to as “sore throat”. Tonsillitis, due to the position of the tonsils, involves a part of the throat, but occurs when the inflammation primarily affects the tonsils. Tonsillitis and pharyngitis can occur separately or together, in which case it is called pharyngotonsillitis. If pharyngitis causes no inflammation of the tonsils, this is not tonsillitis. 14"

    "condition": "Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/",
    "what_is_a_transient_ischemic_attack": "A transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke, is a sudden, short-lived neurological condition. It is caused by a small, temporary blockage in one of the blood vessels that carries blood to the brain. Common transient ischemic attack signs and symptoms include temporary loss of vision, slurred speech, and weakness of the face, arm or legs. The attack itself usually passes within a few minutes, and symptoms generally clear within an hour of them first appearing. 1\n\nThe swift recovery time of a TIA (transient ischemic attack) is what differentiates it from an ischemic stroke . In an ischemic stroke, the blockage tends to last for more than a few minutes and can cause long-term damage to the brain. This is why a transient ischemic attack is often referred to as a mini-stroke . Although a TIA does not usually cause permanent damage to the brain, in some cases it can be a warning sign that a full-blown stroke may occur in the near future. Treatment often aims to prevent further attacks or strokes through medication, lifestyle changes and, in certain cases, surgery. People who suspect that they may have had a TIA, should treat it as a medical emergency and immediately discuss their symptoms with a doctor.",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) tend to arrive and leave quickly. Symptoms usually peak within the first minute of their appearance and then disappear within an hour. Common signs of a transient ischemic attack or mini-stroke include: 1 2 3 4 Weakness or paralysis of the face, arm or leg, usually on one side of the body Loss of vision Slurred speech, also known as dysarthria Difficulty finding words, also known as dysphasia Loss of balance Impaired memory Confusion Behavioral changes Headache However, it should be noted that these symptoms are usually different from person to person, and a person may not experience all of these symptoms. This is because a blood vessel blockage can affect different parts of the brain, and different parts of the brain control different parts of the body. 1 Although transient ischemic attack symptoms typically disappear within an hour and leave no lasting neurological damage, an attack signifies a greater risk of a stroke happening in the future. The American Stroke Association estimates that around a third of people who experience a TIA go on to suffer a more severe stroke within a year. Strokes can result in long-lasting damage and, in the most serious cases, even death, so it is important to always consult a doctor if a transient ischemic attack is suspected.",
    "what_causes_transient_ischemic_attack": "A TIA is most often caused by a small, temporary blockage in an artery that carries oxygenated blood to the brain. This blockage causes a part of the brain to be temporarily without oxygen, resulting in the symptoms of a TIA (transient ischemic attack). The blockage is usually a blood clot that becomes lodged in the artery. Blood clots typically develop when tiny particles in the blood, known as platelets, stick to fatty deposits called plaques. 1 The cause of a transient ischemic attack is identical to the cause of an ischemic stroke. However, in a TIA, the blood clot tends to break up quickly , and the affected part of the brain is only without oxygen for a few minutes at most. 3",
    "transient_ischemic_attack_risk_factors": "A transient ischemic attack can affect anyone, but there are a number of risk factors that may increase the risk of an attack occurring.\n\nThe following risk factors for a TIA or mini-stroke cannot be modified, but it is still important to know what they are in order to assess overall risk: 3 5 6 Age. Being older than 55 years of age. Although TIAs are more common among the elderly, they can occur at any age Genetics. Having a family history of TIAs or strokes Gender. Being male. Men are slightly more likely to have a transient ischemic attack than women Ethnicity. Being of a certain ethnic background. Transient ischemic attacks are more likely to affect African-American people, and are more likely to affect Hispanic people at a younger age than those of non-Hispanic background\n\nTransient ischemic attacks are also more likely to occur in people with certain medical conditions, including: 2 3 5 6 High blood pressure, known as hypertension Diabetes Obesity Heart disease Abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial fibrillation High cholesterol Sickle cell disease Carotid artery disease (CAD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) High levels of fats or lipids in the blood, known as dyslipidemia Predisposition to the formation of blood clots, known as thrombophilia or hypercoagulability Inflammation of the blood vessels, known as vasculitis\n\nIn addition to the above, there are a number of controllable lifestyle factors associated with an increased risk of transient ischemic attack: 2 3 5 6 7 8 Smoking. Cigarette smoking can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of blood clots forming Diet. High-salt, high-fat, high-calorie foods may increase the risk of TIA Excess alcohol. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines moderate alcohol consumption as no more than one alcoholic drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men. High alcohol consumption can be linked to high blood pressure, diabetes, and weight gain Lack of exercise. Physical inactivity can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol and weight gain Birth control pills. Oral contraceptive pills have been linked to an increased risk of ischemic strokes, although the risk is very low",
    "diagnosing_a_transient_ischemic_attack": "As symptoms of a transient ischemic attack usually resolve within an hour, diagnosis is often made retrospectively. 2 Even if symptoms appear to have passed, it is crucial to visit the doctor for a prompt, proper diagnosis. The diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack often begins with questions about the symptoms experienced and a physical examination. This may include: 1 2 10 11 Tests for the existence of known risk factors such as high blood pressure Neurological tasks to test coordination, strength, and understanding Eye examination to detect any blockage in the blood vessels at the back of the eye Audial examination of the neck using a stethoscope, to detect a murmuring sound in the arteries known as a bruit Referral to a specialist doctor or neurosurgeon might be made for further tests to take place. Such tests may include: 1 2 10 11 Neuroimaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI scan, to generate a 3D image of the brain Blood tests to check for clotting, diabetes, and cholesterol levels among others Vascular ultrasound, which uses non-invasive sound waves to detect abnormalities in the arteries and veins Echocardiogram, which also uses non-invasive sound waves to scan the heart and nearby blood vessels Electrocardiogram (ECG), which uses small electrodes to monitor the heart’s rhythm and electrical activity Diagnostic procedures will vary from person to person, depending on their individual circumstances and medical history. However, the aims of these procedures are: 1 To confirm the diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack, rather than a stroke To determine which underlying medical factors may have caused the attack To identify and prevent factors which may increase the risk of a mini-stroke or stroke happening in the future",
    "transient_ischemic_attack_treatments_and_prevention": "Once a transient ischemic attack diagnosis has been made, treatment methods usually aim to reduce both the short and long-term risk of another attack taking place by addressing any associated medical issues. 12\n\nPrescription drugs are typically used to reduce the possibility of blood clots forming. Precise medications will depend on the affected person’s own circumstances, but doctors may prescribe: 1 2 10 Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel. These reduce the stickiness of platelets in the blood, therefore reducing the risk of blood clots forming Anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin, dabigatran or rivaroxaban. These work by blocking the production of certain proteins that cause blood clotting Medication for other risk factors such as statins to treat high cholesterol, or antihypertensives to treat high blood pressure\n\nCertain risk factors for transient ischemic attacks can be reduced through simple lifestyle alterations, such as: 7 10 13 Stopping smoking, as cigarettes can raise blood pressure, damage the arteries and increase the risk of blood clots forming Eating more fresh fruit and vegetables as part of a low-fat, low-salt, balanced diet Reducing alcohol intake. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends a maximum of one alcoholic drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men Exercising more often. Around 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise a day can lower blood pressure and cholesterol Control of other existing medical conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation and diabetes\n\nIn some cases, a surgical procedure called a carotid endarterectomy may be suggested. This is only recommended for certain people who have a severe narrowing of the carotid artery in the neck. 14 Narrowing of the carotid artery is typically due to fatty deposits, known as atheroma or plaque, building up in the arterial walls and restricting blood flow to the brain. A carotid endarterectomy involves opening up the affected artery and removing the buildup of plaque. The procedure usually takes between one and two hours and is done under anesthetic.",
    "complications": "Although a TIA typically lasts only a few minutes and causes no permanent damage, it can be a warning sign that the affected person may suffer a more severe ischemic stroke in the near future. Ischemic strokes can result in a number of complications, and therefore transient ischemic attacks also require urgent medical attention.",
    "other_names_for_transient_ischemic_attack": "Transient ischemic attacks may also be referred to as: TIAs Mini-strokes With the slight spelling variation of transient ischaemic attacks",
    "transient_ischemic_attack_faqs": "Q: What is the difference between a transient ischemic attack and a stroke? A: Both conditions involve restricted blood flow to the brain, but with a TIA (mini-stroke), the blockage dissolves and symptoms typically clear within an hour. In an ischemic stroke, the blockage remains longer, causing brain damage and possible long-term disability. A TIA often serves as a warning sign for a future stroke. Both require immediate medical attention. Q: What are the signs of a transient ischemic attack? A: Signs of a transient ischemic attack can vary depending on which part of the brain is affected, but the most common symptoms include: Facial, arm, or leg weakness/paralysis Vision problems Speech difficulties Loss of balance Q: How long does a transient ischemic attack last? A: Transient ischemic attack symptoms usually clear within minutes, but urgent medical attention is still necessary even after symptoms pass. Q: Is it necessary to see a doctor after a transient ischemic attack? A: Yes. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) are medical emergencies requiring urgent medical intervention Q: Are there long-term effects of a transient ischemic attack? A: TIAs typically don't cause permanent damage, but they can signal an increased risk of future strokes or underlying conditions like heart problems, which is why immediate medical attention is essential."

    "how_to_diagnose_trichomoniasis": "Trichomoniasis infection is suspected in men and women who show clinical signs and symptoms of genital organ inflammation caused by a Trichomonas parasite. A doctor may suspect an infection and may take a patient history along with a physical examination. 4 After this, laboratory investigations can be carried out, and a doctor or nurse may take a swab sample from the penis or vagina. The swab samples are analyzed, and tests include: 3 4 Microscopy: examining the sample using a microscope to detect the Trichomonas parasite quickly. Culture: the sample is sent to the laboratory and cultured for several days to identify the presence of the parasite. From the swab samples collected, a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) may also be used to diagnose Trichomoniasis and is regarded as gold standard testing. This technique makes the organism easier to detect and is also available as a self-test kit. In men, a urine sample can also be used to detect Trichomoniasis. 4 The urine can be sent for culture, making a diagnosis more likely. If Trichomoniasis is suspected, antibiotic treatment may be started before receiving your test results to ensure prompt treatment and prevent spreading to others . 4 Read more about at-home trichomoniasis test here >>",
    "trichomoniasis_treatment": "Trichomoniasis treatment involves medication with antibiotics. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends using Metronidazole to treat Trichomoniasis. The CDC suggests: 5 Metronidazole 500 mg 2 times per day for 7 days for women Metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose for men Treatment of sex partners is also vital to cure a Trichomoniasis infection. Metronidazole may have side effects, including a metallic taste in the mouth, and if taken with alcohol, it can cause nausea and flushing of the skin. 3 An alternative medication regimen can be Tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose. 5 Tinidazole can be more effective and have fewer side effects; however, it can be usually expensive. 5 There are some basic measures which you can do to prevent trichomoniasis; these are: 3 6 Regular and correct use of condoms Avoiding unsafe sex practices such as frequently changing partners or having sex with a partner who has multiple partners Avoid sharing adult toys.",

    "what_is_trigeminal_neuralgia": "Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition in which a dysfunctional facial nerve causes persistent or recurring facial pain. Women older than 40 years of age are most commonly affected by this condition. The condition is characterized by attacks of sudden, sharp, shooting pain in some parts of the face. It is most commonly one-sided, around the eye, cheek, jaws or the lower parts of the face and triggered by movements like smiling, chewing and more. The diagnosis is mostly made based on the symptoms and physical examination. Treatment involves medication to reduce the pain, and, if applicable, surgery. Although the pain can be difficult to control, many people find relief with a combination of therapies.",
    "risks": "Trigeminal neuralgia is pain which comes from the trigeminal nerve (neuralgia means 'nerve pain'). The trigeminal nerve carries feeling from the facial skin to the brain, and controls the muscles needed for chewing. In many cases, there is no obvious cause for the pain. Sometimes trigeminal neuralgia occurs as the result of another medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), or a tumor that is pressing on the nerve. Although anyone can develop trigeminal neuralgia, it is more common in people older than 40. It is more common in women than men.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptom is a very strong, sharp and electric pain of the face. This typically comes from the ear and spreads around the eye, and over the cheek, jaw and chin. This pain is usually only present on one side of the face, though it can occur on both sides in some cases. The pain tends to come in short-lived, 'electric shock'-like bursts. Talking, smiling, chewing, light touch on the face, swallowing and kissing can trigger the pain, though some people have pain without any trigger at all. As the pain is located in the jaw, teeth or gums, it can be mistaken for tooth pain.",
    "diagnosis": "The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and physical examination. Imaging of the head, such as with a CT scan or MRI scan, are usually done to exclude other causes for the pain, like MS or a tumor.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of trigeminal neuralgia involves treating the underlying cause, if there is one, and managing the pain. Many people find that normal pain medications don't help, so some medications which specifically target nerve pain are used. These include anti-seizure medications and muscle relaxants. are known to show good effects.

    "overview": "Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria. Tuberculosis can be diagnosed after a blood test or a skin test Treatment for tuberculosis is essential to stop the progression of the condition. Without treatment, active tuberculosis is often fatal.\n\nTuberculosis is a common infectious disease caused by bacteria . Although this condition occurs more frequently in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, people worldwide can get infected. Recognizing the signs of tuberculosis and getting diagnosed early on is important to prevent the progression of the condition. This guide by Ada’s medical team provides more information on tuberculosis, its symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options.",
    "what_is_tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis, often abbreviated as TB, is a contagious condition that primarily affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the nervous system, the kidneys, the bones, and the lymph nodes. Tuberculosis occurs frequently and can be found in every part of the world, with an estimated 13 million people in the US having inactive tuberculosis. 1",
    "what_are_the_symptoms": "The symptoms of tuberculosis are only present in people who have active tuberculosis . If you have inactive tuberculosis, then you won’t experience any tuberculosis symptoms, although they can develop at a later stage if you do not seek any treatment. Some common signs of tuberculosis are: 1 2 A persistent cough Coughing up blood or phlegm Chest pain Feeling weak Fatigue Weight loss Loss of appetite Fever Night sweats Chills",
    "what_causes_tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis is caused by a bacteria . The bacteria causing the illness is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis in most cases, although the disease can also be caused by a different kind of bacteria called Mycobacterium bovis. 1 Tuberculosis is contagious , as the bacteria can be spread from one person to another when an infected person coughs, speaks, sings, or sneezes. Not everyone who gets infected with tuberculosis actually gets sick. This is why there’s an essential distinction between inactive tuberculosis (also called latent tuberculosis) and active tuberculosis . People with inactive tuberculosis do not show any signs and symptoms of tuberculosis and cannot spread the disease to others. However, people with active tuberculosis experience tuberculosis symptoms and are contagious. 3",
    "what_puts_you_at_risk_for_tuberculosis": "Anyone is at risk of an infection with tuberculosis, although there are some situations in which you have a higher risk of getting infected : 1 Frequently visiting countries where tuberculosis is more common, such as Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Living in close proximity to others who have tuberculosis, for example, in homeless shelters, prisons, hospitals, and nursing homes. Spending time with someone who has active tuberculosis Having a weakened immune system due to HIV , diabetes , cancer, or certain medications. The risk of progressing from inactive tuberculosis to active tuberculosis also depends on certain factors. You are at a higher risk if you: 3 Have underlying health issues such as chronic lung diseases, diabetes, and renal disease, or any immunosuppressive condition Smoke, drink alcohol, or substance use Have severe malnutrition Read also our article about disseminated tuberculosis here >>",
    "where_can_i_get_a_tuberculosis_test": "If you think that you may be at risk for tuberculosis, then it’s a good idea to get a tuberculosis test. Your healthcare provider can help you with this. 2 different types of screening tests can detect tuberculosis infections. It could be a TB blood test or a TB skin test. 1 3 The TB blood test is also known as an interferon-gamma release assay . For this test, your healthcare provider will draw blood and test it to see if there are any substances in it that indicate an immune system reaction to the presence of tuberculosis bacteria. A TB skin test , called the Mantoux test , can detect tuberculosis by injecting some liquid underneath the surface of your skin. If tuberculosis is present in your body, you’ll notice a reaction within a few days. 1 4 If you’ve ever received a tuberculosis vaccine, you’ll be recommended the TB blood test , as the vaccine may interfere with the skin test. In case one of these two tests comes back positive, you’ll have to undergo more testing to determine whether you have an active or inactive case of tuberculosis. These tests can include a chest x-ray and a phlegm test . 1",
    "how_to_treat_tuberculosis": "Tuberculosis treatment is crucial for yourself and those surrounding you, as tuberculosis is an infectious condition. Both people with active and inactive tuberculosis require treatment , even if there aren’t any tuberculosis symptoms present. In order to exterminate all the tuberculosis bacteria, it’s important to follow the instructions of your healthcare provider closely and to finish all of your tuberculosis medication . 5 If you have inactive tuberculosis , there’s a 5-10% chance that you’ll develop active tuberculosis at some point in your life. Tuberculosis treatment can help prevent the development of active TB , and active tuberculosis can also be treated with medication. Your doctor may prescribe you with a combination of the following drugs depending on the suitability of your case: 3 Isoniazid Rifampin Rifapentine Ethambutol Moxifloxacin Pyrazinamide A tuberculosis vaccine exists, although it isn't generally administered in the United States. It aims to prevent severe forms of active tuberculosis in children and is often used in countries where the disease is more common. Infection control plans are crucial to minimize the risk of exposure and can help prevent the spread of tuberculosis. 1",
    "wrapping_up": "Tuberculosis is a serious condition caused by bacteria. These bacteria can spread through the air from an infected person to others. The condition can be active or inactive. Active tuberculosis causes symptoms and is contagious, whereas inactive tuberculosis is not contagious and doesn't cause any symptoms. Both forms of tuberculosis require treatment to prevent the progression of the disease. Without treatment, active tuberculosis is often fatal.",
    "tuberculosis_faqs": "Q: How do you get tuberculosis? A: You can get tuberculosis by coming into contact with an infected person. The disease spreads through little droplets in the air which can be released once an infected person talks, sneezes, coughs, or sings. Q: What is the first sign of tuberculosis? A: The first signs of tuberculosis are persistent coughing, fever, unexplained weight loss, a general feeling of being unwell, and coughing up blood or phlegm. Q: What does tuberculosis look like? A: People with active tuberculosis may experience a cough and may cough up blood or phlegm. Other common symptoms are weakness, fatigue, fever, chest pain, and weight loss. People with inactive tuberculosis do not experience any symptoms. Q: Is tuberculosis contagious? A: Tuberculosis is a contagious condition that spreads through the air. Only people with active tuberculosis can spread the bacteria that cause the condition. Q: Is there a cure for tuberculosis? A: Tuberculosis can be cured using a combination of antibiotics for a longer period of time. Treatment usually takes 4 - 9 months and is needed to stop the progression of the disease. Without treatment, tuberculosis is often fatal. Q: Is tuberculosis fatal? A: Tuberculosis is often fatal if the disease isn’t treated properly. With treatment, however, the fatality rates of tuberculosis decrease significantly."

If someone eats food or drinks beverages that have been contaminated with the bacteria, then they can fall ill as well. These bacteria can spread from an infected person to others through the feces, or less commonly through pee. Typhoid fever causes are often abbreviated as the 4F’s. This abbreviation stands for flies, fingers, feces, and fomites, and refers to the ways that the bacteria can spread to foods and drinks.",
    "how_to_diagnosis_typhoid_fever": "In order to diagnose typhoid fever , your healthcare provider will ask you questions about the symptoms you’re experiencing and your medical history . If you’ve recently traveled to a country where typhoid fever occurs commonly and you have a fever, then your healthcare provider may suspect the condition. The next steps will be a series of laboratory tests . For these tests, some samples of your stool, blood, or urine will be collected. These samples are then analyzed under a microscope to check for the Salmonella bacteria. If the tests are inconclusive, a bone marrow sample may be needed to diagnose typhoid fever. Once the diagnosis of typhoid fever is confirmed, other members of your household may also need to be tested as typhoid fever is very contagious, and early detection and treatment is essential.",
    "what_is_the_recommended_typhoid_fever_treatment": "Typhoid fever treatments include antibiotics . The treatment strategy depends on how far the disease has progressed. Most cases of typhoid fever are mild in Europe and the U.S., and can usually be treated at home with a course of antibiotic tablets for 1 to 2 weeks. In more severe cases of typhoid fever, hospitalization may become necessary. In these cases, antibiotics will be administered through your bloodstream. Signs of recovery from typhoid fever are the symptoms fading away and your fever decreasing . 2 3 Typhoid fever supportive therapy can consist of rehydration , as your diarrhea may cause you to become dehydrated. The typhoid fever vaccine can help provide protection against typhoid fever. The typhoid vaccine is recommended for anyone living in or traveling to parts of the world where typhoid fever occurs frequently. This includes: India Africa South and Southeast Asia South America The typhoid shot does provide some protection against typhoid fever, but it’s not a guarantee that you won’t fall ill.

    "condition": "Ulcerative Colitis (UC)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/ulcerative-colitis/",
    "what_is_ulcerative_colitis_uc": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two main forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The other is Crohn’s disease. Ulcerative colitis is a fairly common condition: approximately 907,000 people in the U.S. are believed to be affected. 1 The term colitis refers specifically to inflammation in the colon, or large intestine. In UC, inflammation occurring in the colon and/or rectum causes small ulcers to develop on the lining of the affected area, which may bleed and produce pus. Over time, the inflammation can permanently damage the mucosal (top) and submucosal (second) layers of intestinal tissue that line the colorectal area. This results in a variety of intestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and cramping. In addition, UC may also lead to problems in other body systems, either as a direct result of intestinal dysfunction, or due to more widespread effects of inflammation. Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong (chronic) condition which requires regular medical attention. After diagnosis, a person may need to adapt their lifestyle to accommodate their treatment needs, which will vary according to a number of factors, including the individual’s age, the severity of their condition, and any other medical conditions they may have.",
    "symptoms": "A person who is affected by ulcerative colitis may experience a wide range of possible symptoms, to varying degrees of severity, including:\n\nSymptoms which are directly related to one’s intestinal health, such as: Diarrhea; possibly featuring blood, mucus or pus Rectal pain Abdominal pain and cramping Urgency to defecate\n\nSymptoms related to a person’s overall level of health and/or symptoms which affect other areas of the body. Possible extraintestinal manifestations of UC may include: Involuntary weight loss Loss of appetite Fatigue Malnutrition Inflammation affecting the eyes, skin or joints If you think you or a loved one may be showing signs of ulcerative colitis, or are otherwise unwell, you can get a free symptom assessment at any time by downloading the Ada app .\n\nUC almost always begins in the rectum and spreads upwards through the bowel in a continuous fashion. The scope of symptoms depends on what section of the colon the inflammation reaches. For this reason UC can be divided into the following subtypes: 2\n\nThis type of UC only affects the rectum. This is the mildest type of UC, as the colon itself is generally able to function as normal. Symptoms are usually directly related to defecation, including diarrhea, tenesmus (a sensation of urgency without defecation) or, in some cases, constipation. Most people with proctitis will pass blood or blood stained mucus from the rectum.\n\nInflammation occurs in the rectum as well as the sigmoid colon - the final section of the colon which adjoins the rectum. The symptoms are similar to those of proctitis, although constipation is much less likely. Further health complications are significantly less likely to develop from proctosigmoiditis, compared to cases where a greater intestinal area is affected. 3\n\nAlso known as left-sided colitis, distal colitis affects the the left side of the colon, the sigmoid colon and the rectum. This is the most common form of UC, and recent treatment approaches have focused on devising medications that target the distal portion of the colorectal area. 4 Distal colitis can cause pain on the left side of the abdomen , as well as the symptoms listed above.\n\nAlso known as total colitis or universal colitis, pancolitis affects the entire colorectal area. Symptoms may include severe abdominal pain and cramping, as well as frequent episodes of diarrhea, often accompanied by blood, mucus and pus. Fever, weight loss and other systemic health complications may also be present, as pancolitis can impact the colon’s ability to take in nutrients, compromising a person’s overall health. 5\n\nThis is a form of UC in which the majority of the colon is affected, but not the entire colon; the part of the colon directly adjoining the small intestine is not affected. The symptoms, treatment and outlook for extensive colitis are almost identical to those of pancolitis.\n\nUC can also be classified according to its severity, with fulminant colitis being one of the rarest and most severe forms. Fulminant colitis usually affects people who have already been diagnosed with another, less severe form of UC. 6 Symptoms include severe pain and cramping, intense and protracted episodes of diarrhea, and bleeding. Immediate medical attention is needed if fulminant colitis occurs , as life-threatening complications like toxic megacolon can occur if it is left untreated. 7\n\nNot everybody will experience all of the possible symptoms of UC. People with ulcerative colitis often find their symptoms vary over time , and that they experience periods of: Flare-ups, in which the inflammation is active, new damage occurs to the intestinal tissue and the individual experiences additional symptoms or a worsening of symptoms. Remission, in which the inflammation is inactive, their intestinal tissue can begin to heal and symptoms may be absent or mild enough not to interfere with day-to-day routine. Flare ups can occur despite treatment for UC. The symptoms of a flare-up vary between people, depending on factors like the type and severity of UC, as well as how a person defines a period of remission. Frequent or prolonged flare-ups of UC may increase one’s likelihood of developing related health complications. People who are in remission are usually advised to contact their healthcare professional if they suspect the beginnings of a flare-up, so that a specific treatment plan can be devised. In severe flare ups the following additional symptoms may occur: Shortness of breath Fast or irregular heartbeat High temperature These symptoms require immediate medical assessment.",
    "causes": "UC is understood to result from an inappropriate immune response, although the exact cause for this response is not fully understood, and is likely to vary between individuals. Factors which may be involved include: Genetic predisposition. Ulcerative colitis is more common in people with an affected parent or sibling. Environmental triggers. Factors such as adverse reactions to one’s diet and/or medications, stress, and living in deprived socioeconomic circumstances are found to precipitate UC. Infections. Bacterial infections – such as Salmonella and Shigella – may trigger an abnormal immune response in certain genetically-predisposed individuals, causing the immune system to inappropriately attack the lining of the digestive tract.",
    "risk_factors": "People of any age can be affected by UC, but it usually first manifests in adulthood, with peaks in young adulthood between the ages of 15 and 30, and in older adults between the ages of 50 and 70. 8 Risk factors for developing UC include: 9 Being of Caucasian descent; some studies conclude that Ashkenazi Jewish people are particularly at risk Having immediate family members with the condition Living in an industrialized country in an urban area with a high concentration of people 10 Although some kinds of infectious bacteria can sometimes bring about a flare-up of UC, UC itself is not an infectious condition. It cannot be passed from one person to another via bodily contact. Additional risk factors include: 11 Not having had an appendectomy (an operation to remove one’s appendix). UC diagnosis has been found to be slightly less common in people who have previously had their appendix removed due to abdominal inflammation, but appendectomy will not cure UC which is already present. Furthermore, it is not considered to be a preventative measure, because the relationship between the procedure and the condition is not yet sufficiently understood. Not using tobacco products. Nicotine, a component of tobacco, is believed to have immunosuppressive effects, which seem to reduce one’s likelihood of experiencing the autoimmune overreaction that precipitates UC. However, using tobacco products is not considered to be a relevant preventative measure against UC and is never medically advisable. This is due to the many other health complications which may be precipitated or worsened by smoking, including Crohn’s disease , the other main form of IBD.",
    "diagnosis": "For many people, the presence of blood or pus in their stools is an important warning sign of possible UC. It is advisable to seek medical attention promptly if this occurs, to enable early diagnosis if UC is present, and to begin treatment before symptoms worsen or increase in number. When UC is suspected, the doctor will consider a person’s medical history, including previous episodes of digestive discomfort, their lifestyle, including dietary and environmental factors, and whether they have family members affected by UC. The initial consultation will also include a physical examination. The doctor will look out for indications of health complications associated with UC, such as malnutrition (as a result of malabsorption), pale complexion ( anemia ), abdominal tenderness and red, itchy eyes ( uveitis ). To make a definitive diagnosis of UC, it is important that the doctor rules out other possible causes for the presenting symptoms. Other conditions that can be associated with rectal bleeding or diarrhea include: 12 Crohn’s disease , the other main form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Other forms of colitis such as ischemic colitis (caused by a loss of blood supply to part of the colon) and infectious colitis (when bacteria cause irritation in the colon) Lactose intolerance (which occurs when a person cannot digest foods containing lactose, which can cause irritation in the colon) Hemorrhoids (swollen veins in the rectum) Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Colorectal cancer Diagnostic tests will normally be scheduled in order to rule out other possible causes of a person’s symptoms, to confirm a diagnosis of UC if present, and to establish the type and severity of the condition. Diagnostic tests for UC include:\n\nThis is carried out to screen for the presence of bacteria, which can help rule out other infectious causes for one’s symptoms, such as gastroenteritis .\n\nA doctor will usually perform some standard blood tests, as well as some more specialized blood tests, called antibody tests or biomarkers. Standard tests including a person’s complete blood count (CBC) to detect anemia and/or infection, as well as liver function, electrolyte and mineral levels, as these may also be affected by diarrhoea and malabsorption. Antibody blood tests are sometimes useful to differentiate between UC and Crohn’s disease. These examine proteins called antibodies produced by the immune system, which can indicate the presence of particular diseases. Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nImaging techniques may include: 13 X-ray. In addition to CT or MRI scanning, a regular X-ray may be taken initially, to look for signs of inflammation/thickening in the bowel wall. Computed tomography (CT) scanning. An abdominal CT scan is the primary type of imaging used to investigate IBD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. Ideal for people who may wish to avoid the ionizing radiation associated with CT scanning and traditional X-rays, for example pregnant women and those undergoing other treatments involving radiation, such as radiation therapy for cancer.\n\nAn endoscopy is a procedure which usually involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope into the body to examine an area of the gastrointestinal tract. A biopsy (tissue sample taken from the affected area for laboratory analysis) may be taken simultaneously. The specific types of endoscopy which may be used in the diagnosis of UC are: 14 15 Sigmoidoscopy. To examine the rectum and final portion of the colon, using a short endoscope, in suspected cases of proctitis or proctosigmoiditis. Colonoscopy. To examine the entire length of the colon, in suspected cases of distal colitis or pancolitis. Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). A new technique which may sometimes be used in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, which involves swallowing a small capsule containing a camera which passes through the entire gastrointestinal tract. Its detection of inflammation is not considered to be as extensive as traditional techniques, and it is not possible to take a biopsy using CCE. Read more about Preparing for a Colonoscopy »",
    "treatment_and_management": "Ulcerative colitis is a lifelong (chronic) condition, and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms during flare-ups and bringing about or prolonging periods of remission. Although there is no cure for UC, with appropriate treatment and management it is often possible for a person with UC to experience periods of remission lasting years or decades, and to live a fulfilled, active life. During remission, a person’s symptoms will usually be absent, or mild and easily managed. Treatments for UC may include:\n\nAminosalicylates (also called 5-ASAs) are anti-inflammatory medications which are prescribed as a first-line treatment for UC. They are suitable in cases of mild or moderate UC, and can be taken in the long-term, to maintain remission, or short-term, to calm flare-ups. The dose and method of administration depends on the severity of one’s UC.\n\nCorticosteroid medications are a more powerful type of anti-inflammatory medication than aminosalicylates and may be used to treat flare-ups in cases where aminosalicylates have not calmed the symptoms on their own. Corticosteroids are suitable for short-term use and are a commonly prescribed treatment for flare-ups. Long-term use of corticosteroids is associated with problematic side effects including osteoporosis , weight gain and the development of other gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nThese medications work by reducing the activity of one’s immune system. In this way, they can serve to alleviate the intestinal inflammation that occurs in people with IBD. They are used to treat mild or moderate flare-ups (often to be administered intravenously under hospital supervision), and to maintain remission in people whose symptoms do not respond to other medications.\n\nBiologic therapies are usually prescribed in cases where other treatments have not worked, rather than as a first-line treatment. They are a type of immunosuppressant medication which use naturally occurring substances such as antibodies and enzymes to inhibit the effects of UC. 16 The most commonly prescribed biologic medications used to treat UC are Infliximab and Adalimumab. These are suitable for both adults and children with moderate to severe UC. They are also called anti-TNF medications because they inhibit a protein called the TNF-alpha, which is found in everybody’s blood as a response to infection. 17\n\nIn cases where medications have not alleviated the symptoms of UC or in cases where a person’s quality of life is severely compromised by their condition, surgery to permanently remove the entire colon may be recommended, with a procedure called a total colectomy. It is carried out as an inpatient procedure under general anesthetic by a colorectal surgeon. This may be performed using open surgery or laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery. The removal of the colon necessitates the installation of an alternative mechanism for waste to leave the body. This may involve:\n\nThe small intestine will be redirected so that its contents exit the body through a hole made in the abdomen called a stoma. One can attach a colostomy bag to the hole to collect bodily waste. Ileostomies can either be temporary (in which case, an ileo-anal pouch will eventually be created during a subsequent operation), or permanent.\n\nAlso known as a J-pouch, this involves creating a pouch inside the body from the tissue of the small intestine. The pouch is connected to the anus and replaces the colon, allowing waste to pass though as normal. Both the colectomy itself and one’s life afterwards present challenges for an individual to adapt to. Some people may therefore prefer to manage their UC with non-surgical treatments.\n\nPeople living with UC may find it helpful to: 18 Establish a good relationship with their medical care team Let their loved ones and colleagues know as much as necessary about their condition so as to prepare for times when they are incapacitated or unavailable due to a flare-up Receive counseling or therapy to treat any anxiety and stress engendered by UC Ensure access to sufficient supplies of medications at all times Find out the location of nearby restrooms in all locations they will visit during the course of a day\n\nThere is no recommended diet for people with UC. However, individuals may find that certain foods trigger the symptoms of UC. Many people with UC find it helpful to: Avoid substances which induce bowel movements, such as spices, caffeine, alcohol and laxative fruits Experiment with low-residue foods, such as cooked, peeled vegetables, white bread and lean meat (this can reduce the size and frequency of one’s stools) Drink plenty of fluids to avoid the dehydration which is often caused by diarrhoea Keep a food diary to record items which may have precipitated an adverse digestive reaction Take food supplements such as vitamins and minerals to replace those lost due to diarrhea and/or malabsorption Eat multiple small meals per day, as opposed to a few large ones, in order to avoid putting too much pressure on the gastrointestinal system It is advisable to discuss one’s diet with the doctor during the initial consultation about UC and again before making significant changes to it. The doctor will be able to advise on the most sensible diet plan for an individual’s profile and condition, taking their treatment plan into account.",
    "complications": "In addition to experiencing the symptoms of ulcerative colitis, people with UC are predisposed to develop a number of further health complications. However, by diagnosing and beginning to treat UC promptly one can decrease the likelihood of developing any complications. Possible complications of UC include: 1 19 20 21 22 23 Fistula. An abnormal passage between the bowel and surrounding structures. Gastrointestinal perforation. A life-threatening complication, in which a hole develops in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The earliest symptom of this is usually severe pain which worsens with movement. . Stricture. The narrowing of part of the colon or rectum. Surgery may be needed to remove the affected part of the colon. Toxic megacolon. A rare complication in which the colon expands and dilates, often due to bacterial infection. This can result in the rupturing of the colon. Colorectal cancer (CC). People with UC are at higher risk of contracting CC. It is recommended that they undergo regular screening. Osteoporosis. A skeletal disorder in which the structure of the bones becomes porous. Arthritis. Inflammation and stiffening of the joints. This often co-occurs with flare-ups. Anemia. A deficiency of healthy red blood cells, which can result in pale skin and fatigue. Skin disorders. Several dermatological problems are linked to UC. They tend to worsen during a flare-up and improve when the UC is brought under control. Eye problems. People with UC are at increased risk of eye problems, including uveitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (liver disease). A uncommon, chronic form of liver disease, often discovered in routine blood tests.

    "ulcerative_colitis_faqs": "Q: What are the differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease? A: Ulcerative colitis shares several important characteristics with Crohn’s disease. They are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and are chronic (long-term) conditions which involve inflammation of the gut. However, ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine, whereas Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal system. The two conditions may differ in their symptoms. People with Crohn’s disease tend to produce bulky stools containing undigested fats, whereas stool samples from people with ulcerative colitis are more likely to contain blood. Tenesmus and rectal pain are more characteristic of ulcerative colitis, whereas fistulae and weight loss are more likely to occur in cases of Crohn’s disease. 24 If you think that you or a loved one may be experiencing symptoms of either of these conditions, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app . Q: Will ulcerative colitis affect one’s pregnancy? A: It is possible for people with UC to have an uncomplicated conception and pregnancy and a healthy baby. However, doctors recommend conceiving at a time when neither partner is experiencing a flare-up of UC. 25 Problems associated with conception during a flare-up of UC may include: An increased likelihood of having active UC during pregnancy , in comparison to women who become pregnant during a period of remission In turn, in those affected by flare-ups of UC during pregnancy, there are heightened risks of pregnancy complications such as preterm birth or low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage However, it is possible to conceive during a flare-up and/or experience a flare-up during pregnancy and still give birth to a healthy baby. 25 Many medications for UC can be safely taken during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding. A specialist doctor will advise on appropriate management of UC during pregnancy."

The symptoms are usually not predictable and often do not improve with rest. It occurs when the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart is reduced. Hardening and narrowing of the heart blood vessels due to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of stable angina. It is more common in older adults, smokers, and people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol levels. Treatment involves short term treatments to reduce pain and relax the blood vessels of the heart, and long-term medications and lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of having a heart attack in the future. With good management, many people learn to manage their symptoms. However, without treatment, the underlying cause may get worse and eventually cause a heart attack.",
    "risks": "Angina occurs when the heart is temporarily not getting enough oxygen. This occurs when narrowing of the blood vessels of the heart make it difficult for the heart to get extra blood when it needs to work harder (for example, when doing exercise). Unstable angina occurs when the vessels become very narrow. This condition is similar to a heart attack, and is a warning sign that a person may have a heart attack in the future. The most common cause is atherosclerosis, which is the narrowing and formation of collections in blood vessels over time. Older people and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol are more likely to have this condition. Smoking also increases the risk of developing angina.",
    "symptoms": "The typical symptom of angina is a chest pressure or pain that radiates to the left arm, back, jaw or neck. There may also be: sweating shortness of breath nausea and vomiting The symptoms of unstable angina often come on quickly, and may have no predictable trigger. Some people experience symptoms while resting. Some people find that using GTN spray or tablets (glyceryl trinitrate) don't help to improve their symptoms.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, a physical examination and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The best test to look for blockages in the blood vessels is coronary angiography. This involves injecting dye into the blood vessels of the heart and taking X-rays to see any blockages. A blood test will be done to exclude heart attack. Other tests may include an ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography), cholesterol levels and blood sugar levels.",
    "treatment": "Treatment of unstable angina involves short-term measures to reduce pain and long-term measures to reduce the risk of a heart attack. People with chest pain should take GTN (spray, tablet or capsule) under the tongue. If the pain continues or gets worse, the person needs to urgently go to the emergency department. If there are warning signs that a person is at very high risk of a heart attack, emergency angiography could be needed, and a stent (a small wire tube) can be placed to open up any blockages in the blood vessels. Long-term treatment for unstable angina often involves medications to thin the blood, to control blood pressure and to reduce cholesterol levels. An exercise program (cardiac rehabilitation) may be helpful to improve heart function. Eventually, a procedure to open the narrowed heart blood vessels with a stent, or even bypass surgery may be needed to prevent a heart attack.",
    "prevention": "Eating a healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and giving up smoking can help to prevent developing blockages in the blood vessels of the heart. Cholesterol levels, blood pressure and blood sugar should be well controlled in order to prevent this condition."

    "condition": "Upper Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/upper-gastrointestinal-hemorrhage/",
    "what_is_an_upper_gastrointestinal_hemorrhage": "Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is a medical condition in which heavy bleeding occurs in the upper parts of the digestive tract: the esophagus (tube between the mouth and stomach), the stomach or the small intestine. This is often a medical emergency. It occurs when the lining of these organs is damaged, for example by ulcers, tears, or if a blood vessel becomes weak and bursts. This condition is more common in elderly people and people with other medical conditions, such as liver conditions or blood clotting disorders. The symptoms might differ depending on the cause of the bleeding but often include vomiting blood and passing dark tarry stools. An endoscopy (camera through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine) is done to confirm the diagnosis and stop the cause of the bleeding. Treatment involves replacing fluids and blood loss and controlling the bleeding. This condition can be prevented by treating the condition causing the bleed. The outcome after an upper gastrointestinal bleed depends on the amount of blood loss, and whether the bleeding can be controlled. Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your symptom assessment in the free Ada app .",
    "risks_for_upper_gastrointestinal_hemorrhage": "Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is heavy bleeding from the esophagus, the stomach or the upper part of the small intestine. There are many conditions which can cause damage to the lining of these organs and cause bleeding. The most common are stomach ulcers, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), weakness and increased pressure in the blood vessels of the esophagus, and tears in the linings of esophagus or stomach caused by vomiting. Less common causes are a cancer in the area and the overuse of anti-inflammatory medications. It is more common in elderly people and people who have liver cirrhosis (scarring) or kidney disease. People who take medications to thin the blood, or who have problems with blood clotting, may also have an increased risk of developing this condition. Find out more about lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage .",
    "symptoms": "Common upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage symptoms include vomiting blood or vomit which has a coffee-ground appearance. Some people may pass dark, tarry bowel motions. Additional symptoms depend on the amount of blood lost and may include bright red bowel motions, a loss of energy, paleness, fast pulse, dizziness, confusion or even loss of consciousness. Symptoms of the condition causing the bleeding may also be present.",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis is based on the symptoms, the physical examination and endoscopy (a camera through the mouth to look at the esophagus, stomach and small intestine).",
    "treatment": "The most important steps in treatment are to stabilize people who have symptoms due to severe blood loss and to find and stop the bleeding as soon as possible. This often includes blood transfusions, fluids and medicines through a drip (intravenously) to control blood pressure and replace lost blood. The bleeding can often be stopped through endoscopic methods. If that is not successful, surgery might be needed. Treatment of the underlying illness is necessary after the person is medically stable.",
    "prevention": "Preventing bleeds from the esophagus, stomach and small intestine involves treating and preventing the diseases that may cause it. This may include reducing alcohol intake to prevent liver disease, giving up smoking, and avoiding long-term use of anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen, which can cause stomach ulcers. People with stomach ulcers should be treated for Helicobacter pylori, the bacteria which causes this condition. People with this condition should discuss the risk bleeding with a doctor before beginning blood-thinning medications.",

    "condition": "Urinary Incontinence (UI)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/urinary-incontinence/",
    "what_is_urinary_incontinence_ui": "A person who is affected by urinary incontinence (UI), loses control of their urinary sphincter, the two muscles which control the passage of urine into the bladder, resulting in an involuntary leakage of urine. UI is a symptom of other conditions, rather than a medical condition in its own right. People develop UI for a variety of reasons. It is generally associated with conditions which affect people in later life, such as prostate problems in men and the menopause in women . Normal urinary function is controlled by the brain, which sends signals to the muscles that control the urine flow, in particular the pelvic floor muscles. Urine is produced by the kidneys. It contains the waste products from the body — including toxins, salts and water — that collect in the blood. Urine travels from the kidneys via the ureters (these are the connecting tubes between the kidneys and the bladder) to the bladder where it is stored until urination. In people with UI, the brain’s process of sending a signal to the bladder to release the urine can become compromised. This causes a person to be mentally unprepared for a sudden leakage of urine . The muscles in the bladder may also lose their functionality. This renders the bladder physically unprepared to contract and relax as needed in order to store urine effectively. People affected by UI often experience a poorer quality of life than continent people. This is because the condition usually impacts significantly upon an individual’s daily routine. In severe cases, UI can necessitate taking time off work and may cause physical sexual dysfunction due to an inability to control the timing of urination — as well as inspiring feelings of embarrassment and distress. 1 However, in most cases, UI can be alleviated with correct management and/or treatment methods. Treatments include learning behavioral techniques and following an exercise program to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, called Kegel exercises. In cases where an initial treatment plan does not alleviate UI, supplementary surgery may be considered. Alternatively, a long-term strategy for minimising the day-to-day impact of UI can be devised.",
    "symptoms": "People affected by urinary incontinence (UI), experience loss of control over their urinary system. This can result in many different kinds of difficulties related to urinating, ranging from involuntary leakage to becoming unable to fully empty the bladder during urination. UI can be transient : 2 a short-term or temporary problem which clears up on its own after the underlying cause, for example, a urinary tract infection , is resolved. However, UI can persist indefinitely. Ongoing cases of UI are described as chronic 2 and can be the result of long-term conditions which affect the production of urine and/or the urinary system, such as diabetes . Chronic UI can last indefinitely if left untreated, so it is important for anyone affected by UI to seek medical guidance. The most common types of UI are stress incontinence, i.e.placing stress on the bladder during involuntary physical activities, such as sneezing or laughing causes an involuntary release of urine, and urge incontinence, which is a sudden and uncontrollable need to urinate. If you think that you or a loved one may be affected by urinary incontinence, you can get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app . There are six types of urinary incontinence: Transient urinary incontinence. This is temporary, and directly related to a short-term condition being experienced by the affected person. Stress urinary incontinence. This type of UI is due to pressure on the bladder from physical activity, such as sneezing or coughing. Urge urinary incontinence. This involves a sudden and intense need to urinate due to an overactive bladder. Chronic urinary retention. This results in feelings of having failed to fully empty the bladder after urination. This is also called overflow incontinence. Functional urinary incontinence. This relates to an inability to urinate due to physical and mental obstacles. Mixed urinary incontinence. This is when a person experiences two or more types of incontinence in combination. Stress and urge incontinence are the kinds of UI which are most commonly experienced together.\n\nTransient, short-term urinary incontinence can be caused by easily treatable factors, such as an adverse reaction to medication, and will clear up when the causal problem is remedied. In the first instance, when a person presents with UI, the doctor will determine whether the individual is affected by short-term UI and will then seek to treat the cause or causes. In a case where UI is caused by an adverse reaction to medication, for example, this would involve stopping using the medication in question and prescribing a replacement option which is not associated with causing UI. Doctors often use a mnemonic — DIAPERS 3 — to explore the possible causes of transient UI and rule out a diagnosis. Transient UI may be triggered by: D elirium I nfection A trophy (when the pelvic floor muscles weaken due to underuse) P harmaceuticals E xcess urine output R estricted mobility S tool impaction A person can be affected by several causes of transient UI simultaneously. In cases where UI may be caused by multiple factors, treating all the causes will maximise the chances of alleviating the UI. Pharmaceuticals which can cause UI principally do so by relaxing the bladder, increasing fluid retention, or inhibiting bladder contractions. 4 Medications which are often associated with the condition include anti-hypersensitives, pain relievers, psychotherapeutics (muscle relaxants) and others, such as antihistamine. If none of the causes specified in the DIAPERS mnemonic are present, the doctor will begin to investigate other causes of UI, dependent on the specific symptoms of the individual. 2\n\nStress urinary incontinence is one of the two most common types of UI — the other being urge urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence is not related to feeling stressed. It occurs when the urethral sphincter, the pelvic muscles that support the bladder and control the progress of urine into the urethra, weakens. The urethral sphincter ceases to function to prevent the flow of urine into the bladder and when the bladder is put under sudden pressure, this results in involuntary leakages of urine. Activities which may cause leakage of urine with stress incontinence include: Coughing Sneezing Laughing Exercise Heavy lifting People with stress incontinence usually experience small amounts of urinary leakage at intervals over the course of the day. More rarely, the condition can cause a person to involuntarily empty their bladder entirely.\n\nUrge urinary incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome) is one of the two most common types of UI — the other being stress urinary incontinence. Urge incontinence is also sometimes called urgency incontinence because it involves a sudden need to relieve the bladder, causing the affected person to release urine a few seconds after they feel the need to do so. Urge incontinence can be triggered by both physical and psychological factors. Activities and actions which cause leakage of urine with urge incontinence include: Sexual intercourse Reaching orgasm A rapid or sudden change of position Hearing the sound of running water. People affected by urge incontinence may experience urinary leakage very frequently, and typically wake up several times during the course of the night to pass urine. It is not often possible for the doctor to identify a specific cause of urge incontinence, but it primarily affects women and the elderly.\n\nPeople affected by chronic urinary retention (overflow incontinence) cannot empty the bladder completely when they pass urine. Chronic urinary retention can be the result of: A mechanical obstruction, for example a urethral stricture (narrowing of the urethra caused by injury, infection or disturbance to the area from devices such as a catheter). A dynamic obstruction, such as a loss of muscle tone, or by a combination of these factors. The condition can also be caused by the failure of the nervous system to transmit signals to the bladder. People with chronic urinary retention are usually unaware that they are affected, until they develop a further symptom, such as a urinary tract infection (UTI) or lose their bladder control, resulting in an involuntary leakage of urine. Good to know: Rather than experiencing chronic, long-term urinary retention, a person can experience acute urinary retention, a short-term form of UI in which it becomes impossible to empty their bladder at all, even when it is full. 5 Acute urinary retention can be painful and potentially life-threatening, so it is vital to seek urgent medical attention.\n\nPeople experiencing functional urinary incontinence usually become aware that they need to urinate in advance of voiding their bladder. Their involuntary leakage of urine is caused by a range of possible physical and mental factors which prevent them from accessing the appropriate facilities in time. Factors which contribute to functional urinary incontinence can include: Dementia Impaired dexterity Confusion Alzheimer’s disease Parkinson’s disease Depression Anxiety Poor eyesight (this may reduce a person’s ability to find their way to the restroom) Functional urinary incontinence primarily affects the elderly, and people suffering from impaired mobility. It can involve either emptying the bladder fully or passing small amounts of involuntary urinary leakage.\n\nIt is possible for a person to experience several types of UI simultaneously; this is called mixed incontinence. The most commonly experienced form of mixed incontinence involves being affected by both stress incontinence (leaking urine with activity) and urge incontinence (the sudden, uncontrollable urge to pass urine). It is possible to manage and/or treat mixed incontinence with a treatment plan which addresses the triggers of all the types of UI present.",
    "causes": "UI is a common problem which affects more females than males. UI most commonly affects elderly people because it is associated with many conditions that typically develop in later life, such as Parkinson’s disease and dementia. UI may develop as a result of any of the following factors: Another condition affecting the individual, for example, benign prostate hyperplasia A number of different biological processes, for example pregnancy and the ageing of a person’s connective tissue, which can be influenced by their genetics and gender A side-effect of medication A complication relating to a surgical procedure Conditions and procedures which are commonly associated with urinary incontinence include: Urinary tract infections , which may be intermittent or chronic Congenital or birth defects — problems with development of the urinary tract Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — an enlarged prostate gland Kidney failure Vaginal prolapse Injuries to the spinal and nervous system Injuries to the pelvic area Stroke Diabetes High blood pressure Smoking tobacco Alcohol abuse Obesity Interstitial cystitis (bladder pain syndrome) Pregnancy : risk of UI increases with each pregnancy a person experiences Prostatectomy (prostate surgery) Menopause and postmenopausal complications Because of the differences between the sexes in terms of pelvic and genital structure and the way the genitalia are connected to the urinary system, UI generally affects females and males differently in terms of the type of UI experienced, and for different reasons. Females are often affected by UI in relation to their reproductive processes, whereas males commonly experience UI in relation to problems affecting the prostate gland and associated surgery.\n\nWomen are more likely to experience UI than men because they are, physiologically, more likely to undergo bodily changes which compromise the normal function of the urinary system. Women can be affected by all types of UI and at any age. However, UI in women is primarily associated with ageing and with natural biological processes.For example, UI often accompanies pregnancy and also commonly affects women during or after they experience the stages of menopause. The principal types of UI experienced by women are: Stress incontinence Urgency incontinence Mixed incontinence People who have experienced pregnancy are more likely to experience UI. This is because being pregnant always involves changes to a person’s hormonal levels and an increase of pressure on their pelvic floor muscles as the developing fetus grows, which is likely to disrupt urinary function during the pregnancy as well as afterwards. Giving birth itself, particularly vaginally, can alter the position of the pelvic floor muscles that control the flow of urine from the bladder, further increasing the chances of developing UI after being pregnant. However, the hormonal changes and stress to the pelvic floor involved in pregnancy, are the primary causes of UI in women, rather than the actions involved in birth itself. Therefore, opting for a c-section will not significantly reduce a person’s likelihood of developing UI. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may be developing UI, get a free symptom assessment with the Ada app . The risk of UI increases with the number of times a person experiences pregnancy and childbirth. Both cesarean (c-section) and vaginal birthing methods can give rise to UI. Many people experience UI whilst going through the menopause, which involves a reduction in their accustomed estrogen levels. However, it is not thought possible to alleviate UI with any significant success by taking oral estrogen supplements; these can in fact worsen the condition. 6\n\nMen can experience any of the types of UI. UI primarily occurs in males because of developing problems with nerve function, such that the brain no longer sends signals to the bladder effectively. This can include suffering from a stroke or a spinal cord injury (SCI), both of which affect the nervous system, interrupting the transmission of the nerve signals required for control of the urinary sphincter. Those who are affected by problems related to the prostate gland are also at risk of experiencing UI. The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder, inside the male body, between the bladder and the penis and produces about 30% of the body’s ejaculation fluid. Problems which affect the prostate and may be associated with UI, include: Benign prostatic hyperplasia Prostate cancer Prostatitis (swelling of the prostate gland) All of these conditions can change the position of the urinary sphincter and/or exert pressure on the bladder, causing UI. Prostate problems and associated cases of UI most commonly develop in later life. People who have undergone treatment, such as radiation therapy for prostate cancer, or who have undergone a prostatectomy (prostate surgery) will experience urinary incontinence initially. This usually occurs after the urinary catheter, which facilitates urinary function in the initial postoperative period, is removed. UI associated with prostate surgery generally goes away with correct management and/or treatment, as the recovery period progresses. For more information about the prostate and conditions that affect it, see this resource on enlarged prostate .",
    "diagnosis": "Several cross-sectional and/or population-based studies 7 8 9 have been undertaken to investigate a tendency for people, and females in particular, to refrain from seeking medical attention for UI until such point as the urinary leakage poses a serious imposition to their daily routine. A reason which is commonly given for avoiding consulting a healthcare professional, is the perception that UI is a minor problem which one can tolerate. 10 However, it is important to seek medical attention, as UI develops into a long-term condition which does not alleviate without medical management or treatment in most cases. Good to know: Many people are first diagnosed with UI after visiting a gynecologist, a doctor who specialises in the female reproductive system. Gynecologists are trained to look out for all potential cases of UI and understand that women may not mention or know that they could be affected by UI. Due to the fact that UI is often diagnosed by gynecologists first, there is a significant overlap between doctors who specialise in gynecology and urology (treating problems with the urinary system).\n\nTo diagnose UI, a doctor will review a person’s medical history, carry out urinalysis; an analysis of the composition of the person’s urine; and urodynamic testing; tests which ascertain the function of the individual’s urinary system. Doctors who specialise in problems related to the urinary system are called urologists. Urodynamic testing involves filling and then emptying the bladder. Pressure readings are taken from the stomach and bladder throughout the process. The aim of urodynamic testing is to replicate the person’s urination process, allowing the doctor to assess any problems and determine their possible causes. To establish which type or types of UI a person may be experiencing, a doctor will ask about: The timeframe in which difficulties urinating have been experienced Any triggering factors, such as sexual activity, coughing and sneezing, exercise, hearing running water The typical length of time between feelings of urgency, the sudden need to urinate, and actual urination Whether the urine loss is intermittent or constant The volume of urinary leakage Whether the person has experienced urinary tract infections (UTIs) There are many factors which may trigger or worsen UI in a person. Knowledge of a person’s full medical history will help a doctor to determine the type or types of UI which are affecting an individual and the best treatment plan. The doctor will also establish whether a person is using any prescription and/or over-the-counter medications, as these can cause or aggravate UI.",
    "treatment_and_management": "UI can be treated or managed successfully with a variety of methods, including: Absorbent products Physical exercise programs, such as kegel exercises Behavioral treatment Medications Non-surgical procedures, such as electrical nerve stimulation Weight loss (for the obese) Surgery, i.e. procedures to restore the correct function of the urinary system The type of treatment and management techniques required to treat UI will depend on the type and its severity. Often, successful treatment of UI will involve a combination of methods. For example, treatment for stress incontinence may require medication, Kegel exercises and/or behavioural change therapy. In the event that these methods are not sufficient to alleviate the UI, surgery may be considered.\n\nThere is a great variety of absorbent products for people with UI, including pads, panty-liners and adult diapers. These are mostly used to soak up involuntary leakages of urine on a temporary basis while planning further treatment for UI. Doctors will be able to recommend appropriate products for each person.\n\nKegel exercises, which target the main muscles involved in the urinary system are particularly helpful for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles. Doctors will advise on an exercise program. Other techniques which may be recommended to manage or prevent UI include pilates and kyphosis exercises.\n\nMaking various changes to a person’s diet and lifestyle and teaching them specific psychological coping techniques related to managing UI, has been found to reduce instances of involuntary urine leakage. Relaxation and breathing techniques, increasing exercise and avoiding drinking excess caffeine and alcohol are particularly helpful.\n\nThere are several different types of medication which may be used to treat UI, including: Hormonal medications for females which help tone the vaginal and urethral muscle tissue Medications which work by relaxing the muscles in the bladder to increase its capacity Medications to target the neurotransmitters in the brain to help block involuntary muscle movements that lead to urinary incontinence The type of medication which a person is prescribed will depend on factors like their gender and the type and severity of their condition.\n\nThere are several procedures which can strengthen, rejuvenate and reposition some of the muscles in the urinary system, with the goal of improving bladder control and alleviating the symptoms of UI. This includes injecting bulking agents into the urethral wall to strengthen the urethra or electrically stimulating the muscles. These methods have a lower long-term efficacy rate than surgical treatments, but may be preferable for those unwilling to undergo surgery.\n\nIn obese people, losing weight can be an effective way to reduce the impact of UI and should be considered before surgery as part of an initial treatment plan. Losing five to ten percent of one’s body weight can have a similar effect to other non-surgical treatments for alleviating UI in obese people. 11\n\nSurgery is very rarely considered as a first line treatment for UI. It is considered in cases where non-invasive methods such as Kegel exercises, behavioral therapies and/or medications and interventional therapies have been prescribed with negligible results. Most surgery for UI is designed to treat stress incontinence. Most of the surgical procedures for UI have the same goal, bringing the bladder back to its original position. For this reason, surgery for UI is especially performed for treating the condition in women, who are most often affected by UI resulting from factors like hormonal changes, pregnancy and the anatomy of the pelvis changing with age. All of these can cause UI by damaging the pelvic floor in a way which causes the bladder to sink and leave its original position. There are several types of surgical procedure for UI, most of which are carried out under general or regional anesthetic as in-patient procedures by surgeons called urologists,who specialise in problems related to the urinary system. The appropriate kind of surgery will be decided by the doctor on a case-by-case basis. The types of surgery with the best success rates are the sling procedure and bladder neck suspension surgery.",
    "prevention": "Although UI is a symptom of other conditions and/or physical states which exert pressure on the bladder, such as pregnancy, which it may not be possible to avoid, it is possible to minimise the risk of experiencing UI by taking measures to reduce the frequency and acidity of your urination and to exercise your pelvic floor muscles. Methods which contribute to the prevention of UI include: Regular exercise Avoiding spicy and acidic foods Avoiding caffeine and alcohol Eating high-fibre foods to avoid constipation Maintaining a healthy body weight Kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles",
    "urinary_incontinence_faqs": "Q: Does urinary incontinence affect children? </br> A: Cases of UI in children are rare. UI most commonly develops in later life, as a result of physical states, such as pregnancy, and conditions, such as dementia, which affect elderly people. In childhood, boys are more prone to nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) than girls, as they develop bladder control at a later age. Most children develop bladder control by the age of three. 12 UI in children above the age of three is usually the symptom of another condition such as kidney problems or a UTI. An isolated instance of UI is not a cause for concern. However, if a child has UI regularly or for a prolonged period of time, it is important to seek a medical opinion and to diagnose and treat any related conditions the UI may pertain to. Q: How does constipation / fecal incontinence affect UI ?</br> A: Fecal impaction is caused by constipation. When feces builds up in the rectum, it can become packed in so tightly that it is impossible to pass the stool. The blockage puts pressure on the surrounding tissues, including the pelvic muscles related to the bladder and urinary system. This pressure can impede the bladder’s normal function, causing UI. Treating the constipation and removing the blockage will allow the urinary system to resume normal function."

    "condition": "Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/urinary-tract-infection/",
    "what_is_a_urinary_tract_infection": "A urinary tract infection , often referred to as a UTI or urine infection , is an infection of the urinary system. Usually, a urinary tract infection is caused by bacteria from the anal or genital region spreading to the bladder. If left untreated, the infection can continue to spread, eventually reaching the kidneys in the upper urinary tract. UTIs are a very common condition, mostly affecting women, although men can also develop UTIs. Symptoms can include frequent and painful urination, an odd smell to the urine, the presence of blood in the urine and pain in the lower abdomen. Fever, nausea and upper abdominal pain may be a sign that the infection has reached the upper levels of the urinary tract. With prompt antibiotic treatment, most people recover quickly. However, if left untreated, a urinary tract infection can develop into a serious condition with a number of complications. 1",
    "types": "Urinary tract infections can occur anywhere within the urinary tract, which includes the: 2 Urethra, the tube that passes urine out of the body from the bladder. Infection of the urethra is also known as urethritis Bladder, the organ that collects and stores urine. Infection of the bladder is also known as cystitis Ureters, the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder Kidneys, the organs that filter blood, eliminating waste via the urine. Infection of one or both kidneys is also known as pyelonephritis The majority of UTIs affect the bladder and/or the urethra. These are known as lower urinary tract infections. However, the infection can also travel up the urinary tract to reach the kidneys. In rare cases, the ureters may also become infected. These are called upper urinary tract infections. They are less common than lower tract infections and tend to be more severe. 1",
    "symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection often vary from person to person. Factors such as age, gender, and the type of UTI may determine precisely which symptoms are experienced and to what degree. 1 However, there are some common symptoms to look out for as an indication of a urinary tract infection.\n\nCommon symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection include: 2 1 3 Frequent and urgent need to urinate Burning or painful sensation while urinating Strong-smelling urine Urine that is bloody and/or cloudy in color Lower abdominal pain 4\n\nIn addition to the symptoms above, the presence of the following symptoms may indicate that the affected person is suffering from an upper urinary tract infection: 2 1 3 Fever Chills Nausea and vomiting Pain and/or aches between the upper abdomen and the back, known as flank pain Signs of confusion, disorientation and/or agitation may occur, especially in elderly patients\n\nIf you are experiencing possible symptoms of a urinary tract infection, carry out a symptom assessment with the free Ada app .\n\nMost people who develop a urinary tract infection will exhibit symptoms, such as those listed above. However, elderly people are less likely to display classic symptoms specific to the genital and urinary regions. This may be due to changes in immune function as age increases, as well as the possibility of additional diseases and disorders affecting usual bodily responses. 5 Additionally, a urinary tract infection may cause certain behavioral changes in an elderly adult, such as confusion, agitation or disorientation. Such symptoms are often categorized as delirium. People with age-related issues such as delirium or dementia are especially at risk of developing a more severe UTI because they may not be able to communicate their symptoms and receive prompt treatment. 6 Although this connection between UTIs and delirium has been established, the reason why delirium may occur in elderly adults with a UTI is not yet known. 7",
    "causes": "Urinary tract infections are almost always caused by a bacterial infection. The infection most commonly occurs when bacteria from the anal or genital region enter the urinary tract and ascend through the urethra to the bladder and/or kidneys. It is believed that over 85 percent of UTIs are caused by bacteria from the bowel or vagina. 8 80 percent of UTIs are reportedly caused by the E. coli bacteria which is present in human and animal intestines. Most E. coli strains are a natural part of healthy, human digestion. However, some can cause illness when carried outside of the intestinal tract. 10 Usually, any bacteria that enter the urinary tract are flushed out by urine. In some cases, small amounts of bacteria remain in the system, and this can lead to a urinary tract infection. It is also possible to develop a UTI when a bacterial infection from elsewhere in the body spreads through the bloodstream, reaching the kidneys. 8 However, this is much less common. In rare cases, urinary tract infections can also be caused by viruses, fungi and parasites. 8 Read also our article about COVID-19 and UTI here >>",
    "risk_factors_for_developing_urinary_tract_infections": "Urinary tract infections are a very common condition, especially in women, and account for between 1 to 3 percent of all general practice (GP) consultations. 1 Gender is a primary risk factor for urinary tract infections. UTIs are much more common in women than men, and it is believed that roughly half of all women will experience a UTI in their lifetime. 1 Conversely, under the age of 50, only five to eight men out of every 10,000 report experiencing a UTI. 2 Although there are a number of risk factors specific to either men or women, the majority of risk factors are not gender-specific, including: 3 8 11 Age. The likelihood of a UTI increases with age. Over the age of 50, incidences of UTIs increase for both genders, with less disparity between the number of cases in men and women Urinary catheters can cause bacteria to enter the urinary tract Family history of UTIs Urinary tract blockages and conditions which may impair urine flow, such as kidney stones, chronic constipation or abnormal urinary function/structure Diabetes, specifically diabetes mellitus or type two diabetes , due to high urine glucose levels increasing the risk of infection Poor personal hygiene may increase the presence of bacteria in the urinary area Reduced mobility may result in longer gaps between urinations, resulting in a higher risk of infection A weakened immune system reduces the body’s ability to defend against infection\n\nWomen are particularly susceptible to urinary tract infections because their urethra is shorter, meaning the infection can spread throughout the urinary tract more easily. Additionally, the anal and urinary openings of a woman are in closer proximity, increasing the risk of bacteria spreading between the two. In addition to the above, women are also susceptible to the following risk factors for UTIs: 1 4 12 13 Sexual intercourse can contribute to the spread of genital or anal bacteria, especially with a new sexual partner when the rate of sexual activity is typically higher. However, UTIs are not a sexually transmitted disease Spermicides and birth control methods which use spermicides can affect the natural balance of healthy bacteria within the vagina Antibiotics can also alter the natural bacterial balance within the vagina Diaphragms can place pressure on a woman’s urethra, resulting in the possibility of the bladder not emptying properly Pregnancy. As the uterus grows in pregnancy, it can put added weight on the bladder, leading to the possibility of the bladder not emptying properly Menopause can cause hormonal changes which affect the vagina’s natural bacterial balance\n\nWhile urinary tract infections are much less common in men than women, there are a couple of risk factors that are unique to men, such as: 8 14 15 Enlarged or infected prostate , which can obstruct the bladder from emptying properly Uncircumcised men may be more likely to experience a UTI than circumcised men Anal sex. It is commonly accepted that sexual intercourse increases the risk of a UTI in women, but seems to be less of a risk factor in men. However, if a man participates in anal intercourse, the risk of a UTI increases",
    "diagnosis": "Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection usually begins with a consultation based on the symptoms and a physical examination. It is usual for a doctor to also ask about sexual history, medical history, and any instances of previous UTIs. 1 A sample of urine might be requested in order to confirm a diagnosis of a urinary tract infection. Dipstick analysis may be done first to indicate the presence of bacteria in the urine. This quick test entails dipping a small chemical strip into a urine sample, then looking for certain color changes on the strip which may indicate abnormal levels of blood, sugar, or bacteria in the urine. Looking at the urine sample under a microscope can usually confirm the diagnosis, as well as which bacteria has caused the infection. If an upper urinary tract infection is suspected, a doctor may also recommend blood tests in order to check the infection hasn’t spread to the bloodstream. 16 People suffering from recurring or chronic urinary tract infections may be given additional tests to determine if there are any obstructions or abnormalities causing the repeat of the condition. Such tests can include: 1 An ultrasound scan of the bladder and kidneys, which uses painless soundwaves to generate an image of the urinary tract A CT scan or MRI scan for a more detailed analysis of the urinary tract A cystoscopy, in which a small camera is inserted through the urethra to see inside the urethra and bladder\n\nUrinary tract infections usually require a visit to the doctor to confirm diagnosis and receive treatment. If a UTI is suspected, a doctor’s appointment is always recommended for the following groups of people: 1 7 17 18 Children The elderly Men Pregnant women Anyone who has not had a UTI before Anyone with blood in their urine Anyone with symptoms of an upper urinary tract infection Anyone whose symptoms have returned after treatment Some people who experience UTIs on a frequent basis might be offered different management options by their doctor, such as long-term, low-dose antibiotics. 19 In these special cases, the onset of UTI symptoms may be managed at home, and a visit to the doctor is not always necessary. In very mild cases, a bladder infection/cystitis may clear on its own without the need for medical treatment. However, other conditions such as genital herpes or vaginal thrush can be mistaken for cystitis, so people who are unsure whether they have cystitis should still see a doctor. 20",
    "treatment": "With prompt treatment, the majority of people with a urinary tract infection make a full recovery. Medication is usually required to fight the infection. There are also a number of home remedies which may help alleviate discomfort.\n\nBecause urinary tract infections are most often bacterial, they can be treated with antibiotics. As a guideline, antibiotic treatment for UTIs is usually split into two categories: 1 Uncomplicated UTI, which is an infection that occurs in an otherwise healthy person with normal kidney function Complicated UTI, which usually occurs in people who have a medical or anatomical predisposition to urinary tract infections or treatment failure The type of antibiotic used and the length of treatment differs, depending on the severity of the infection and the medical history of the person with the condition. Symptoms from uncomplicated UTIs usually clear within three days of antibiotic treatment, whereas people with complicated UTIs may require antibiotics for up to two weeks. 2 Whatever the cause, it is important to complete the entire course of antibiotics prescribed in full, even if symptoms appear to have cleared. This can help to prevent antibiotic resistance from developing. In the rare cases where a urinary tract infection is caused by a virus or fungi, this can be treated with antiviral or antifungal medication respectively. 8\n\nIt is generally not recommended to treat urinary tract infections with home remedies alone, because antibiotic treatment is usually required to clear the infection. It is only in very mild cases of cystitis that the infection may clear without medical intervention. 20 However, it is possible to use certain natural methods at home alongside antibiotic treatment to alleviate pain and help clear the infection quicker. Such remedies can include: 2 3 21 Drinking plenty of water, ideally at least 1.5 liters a day, to help flush the bacteria out of the body Placing a hot water bottle or heating pad against the abdomen or lower back to ease pain in those areas; make sure to wrap the heating device in a clean cloth or towel before application to avoid burns from direct contact with the skin Taking pain-relief medications, such as paracetamol/acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Drinking cranberry juice has been cited in the past as a successful treatment method for urinary tract infections. Although not harmful, recent studies indicate the benefit of cranberry juice for treating UTIs is limited. 1",
    "preventing_urinary_tract_infections": "Urinary tract infections are most often caused by bacteria spreading from the anal or genital region and entering the urinary tract. Because of this, there are a number of preventative methods that can minimize the risk of experiencing a UTI: 3 22 Regular urination Emptying the bladder after sexual intercourse Drinking lots of water, ideally at least 1.5 liters a day. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can irritate the bladder Wiping from front to back after using the toilet to avoid spreading bacteria from the anal region Maintaining good personal hygiene and keeping the genital area clean and dry Taking showers instead of baths\n\nIn addition to the above prevention methods, women can also: 2 23 24 19 Avoid contraceptive methods that contain spermicide Avoid using a diaphragm as a birth control method Avoid the use of feminine products on genital regions, such as deodorant sprays and douches, which have the potential to irritate the urethra Receive vaccination against certain E. coli strains\n\nFor people that encounter recurring cases of urinary tract infections, doctors may choose to prescribe long-term, low-dose antibiotics. This preventive treatment method is known as antibiotic prophylaxis, and it is administered to reduce the risk of the condition returning. Prophylactic measures may also be suggested to people with urinary catheters, spinal cord injuries, as well as to renal transplant patients and pregnant women. 23",
    "complications": "Urinary tract infections are an extremely common condition, and most people recover quickly with antibiotic treatment. However, if left untreated the infection can spread throughout the urinary tract system, increasing in severity and causing complications. 1 In some cases, the infection can reach the kidneys in the upper urinary tract, an infection known as pyelonephritis . Without medical intervention, this can lead to permanent kidney damage. 25 Possible complications from untreated UTIs include: 1 26 Formation of abscesses within or around the kidneys Swelling of the kidneys, also known as hydronephrosis Sepsis , also known as blood poisoning Prostatitis in men All of these complications are serious and require immediate medical attention.\n\nPregnant women with a UTI that develops into a kidney infection are at higher risk of developing additional complications, which may affect both them and the fetus. Such complications include anemia , premature labor , low birth weight and, in very rare cases, stillbirth. 17 1 Fortunately, early medical intervention means that urinary tract infections in pregnant women can usually be treated successfully. If the affected person has a lower urinary tract infection, a course of oral antibiotics is the most common treatment method. If an upper urinary tract infection is suspected, the doctor may recommend administering antibiotics intravenously in hospital instead. 17 Once the infection has cleared, a doctor may choose to prescribe low-level, prophylactic antibiotics for the remainder of the pregnancy to reduce the risk of a UTI returning. 17 Pregnancy can increase the likelihood of developing a UTI. This is due to numerous factors, including hormonal changes and the increased weight of the uterus putting pressure on the bladder.",
    "urinary_tract_infection_faqs": "Q: What causes a urinary tract infection? A: Urinary tract infections are very common, especially in women, and are most often caused when bacteria from the bowel or genital region enter the body through the urethra. This can lead to an infection of the urethra, bladder, ureters or kidneys. Over 85 percent of UTIs are caused in this way. UTIs can also be caused by viral, fungal or parasitic infections, but these are much less common causes. Q: Can men develop a urinary tract infection? A: Yes, although they are rare in men under 50 years of age. 26 Men are less likely than women to develop a UTI because the male urinary tract has more natural defences to infection, such as a longer urethra and further distance between the urethra and the anus. For this reason, urinary tract infections in men are more likely to be due to a medical cause or an anatomical predisposition to UTIs.{^33] Q: Can children develop a urinary tract infection? A: Yes, urinary tract infections are a common condition in babies, toddlers and children. In fact, it is the most common bacterial infection in children under two years of age. 27 The usual cause of UTIs in children is similar to adults: bacteria from the anal region entering the urinary tract through the urethra. Some children may be at added risk of developing a UTI due to not having developed effective personal hygiene methods, such as wiping from front to back after using the toilet. 28 Read more about Pediatric Urinary Tract Infection » . Q: Does a urinary tract infection require medical treatment? A: Yes, a urinary tract infection usually requires a course of antibiotics to clear the infection. If the UTI has been caused by a virus or fungus, antiviral or antifungal medication may be prescribed instead. With prompt treatment, a urinary tract infection usually clears within a matter of days. Without any medical treatment, a UTI can often develop into a much more serious infection with numerous complications, so a doctor’s appointment is typically recommended. Very mild cases of bladder infection/cystitis may clear on its own in a few days without medical treatment. However, a doctor’s appointment is still recommended if the affected person has any other medical conditions, is pregnant or is not sure if they have cystitis. If symptoms worsen, always seek medical help. Q: What home remedies are there for urinary tract infections? A: Urinary tract infections typically require medical treatment. However, there are a number of home remedies which can help alleviate discomfort and may help clear the infection faster when used in combination with medical treatment. These include: Drinking lots of water, ideally at least 1.5 liters a day. This aids frequent urination and may help to flush the bacteria out of the body Placing a hot water bottle against the abdomen or lower back to help ease pain in those areas Taking pain-relief medication such as paracetamol/acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Q: Is drinking cranberry juice good for a urinary tract infection? A: Research into whether ingesting cranberry products can help prevent a urinary tract infection has had mixed results. One study suggests that certain components found in cranberries can help prevent E. coli bacteria from sticking to the urinary tract walls and thereby limit the risk of infection. 29 However, other studies have shown limited benefits. 30 Therefore, while likely not harmful, cranberry products are not a proven treatment method for UTIs and should not replace medical treatment under any circumstances. Q: What are the risks of a urinary tract infection during pregnancy? A: UTIs can be common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and increased pressure on the bladder due to the growing uterus. The symptoms are similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women. However, if left untreated in pregnancy, a UTI can potentially cause complications such as premature labor , low birth weight and, in very rare cases, stillbirth. Treatment of a bacterial UTI is typically through antibiotics. As certain antibiotics have side effects which may affect the development of a fetus, the doctor will prescribe different antibiotics that are safe to use during pregnancy. With medical intervention, most pregnant women make a full recovery with no further complications."

    "condition": "Uveitis",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/uveitis/",
    "what_is_uveitis": "Uveitis is a broad term used to describe an inflammation of the uveal tract of the eye. The uveal tract is composed of: The iris: the part of the eye making up a person’s eye color The ciliary body: a small muscle behind the iris The choroid: a layer of tissue between the retina (a light sensitive inner coat of the eye), and the sclera (the dense connective tissue that forms the white of the eye) The uveal tract is an area containing a large proportion of the eyes’ blood vessels. 1 Uveitis typically causes pain and blurred vision, but can, in the majority of cases, be successfully treated through the use of medication. However, if left untreated, the condition can lead to complications including glaucoma, cataracts and possible blindness. 2 Uveitis is a relatively rare condition, affecting roughly 2-5 people in every 10,000. It can affect people of any age, though is most common in those aged 20 to 59. 3",
    "types": "There are various types of uveitis, each classified according to the part of the uveal tract the inflammation affects: Anterior uveitis: Affecting the front section of the uveal tract. This is the most common form of the condition and is typically caused by infection, inflammatory diseases or trauma, e.g. blunt force to the eye. Intermediate uveitis: Affecting the middle section of the uveal tract. Typically caused by diseases such as sarcoidosis. Posterior uveitis: Affecting the rear of the uveal tract. This is a rare form of the condition. Panuveitis: When the condition affects the entirety of the uveal tract. This is the most severe form of the condition, which can lead to serious damage to the retina. Each type of uveitis is also classified by the frequency at which it occurs. Uveitis can be: Acute: Quick to develop and will improve within three months. Recurrent: Repeated episodes separated by a number of months. Chronic: Episodes last for a significant period and inflammation returns within three months of treatment.",
    "symptoms": "Symptoms of uveitis, which may affect one or both eyes, can include: 4 Blurred vision Floaters (dark, hovering spots in vision) Pain in the eyes Redness of the eyes Light sensitivity (photophobia) If any symptoms are being experienced or uveitis is suspected, medical attention from a doctor, optician or ophthalmologist (eye specialist) should be sought with urgency. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment. Signs and symptoms of uveitis differ depending on what type of the condition is being experienced: Anterior uveitis is typically associated with pain, blurred vision, light sensitivity and redness. Intermediate uveitis is typically associated with floaters and blurred vision, while pain and also eye redness are uncommon. Posterior uveitis is typically associated with blurred vision and in some cases a loss of vision, pain is most likely absent and the eye most likely won’t be reddened.",
    "causes": "There are three main causes of uveitis: 1 An autoimmune disorder or inflammatory disease Infection Physical trauma or injury to the eye, including eye surgery Often, no specific cause of uveitis can be identified.\n\nAutoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Behcet's disease have been linked to uveitis. An autoimmune disorder is characterized by the body’s immune system producing antibodies to attack its own tissues, with the result, in the case of uveitis, of causing inflammation. The exact reason as to why the immune systems of some people behave this way is unknown. It is also believed that individuals with inflammatory diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis , sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel diseases, e.g. ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease , are more likely to develop uveitis.\n\nBacterial, fungal or viral infection can cause uveitis in some cases. Possible infection types include toxoplasmosis, herpes simplex , herpes zoster , cytomegalovirus , gonorrhea , tuberculosis and Lyme disease .\n\nIf the eye suffers an injury, this can also lead to uveitis.",
    "diagnosing_uveitis": "The first stage of diagnosing uveitis will normally involve a doctor’s examination. If symptoms of the condition are present and uveitis is suspected, a doctor may then refer the individual to an eye specialist, an ophthalmologist, for further examination and confirmation of the diagnosis. Specialists will typically test the individual’s vision, allowing them to see how the condition may be affecting it and assess any differences between each eye. Both eyes will also be examined using a microscope, usually an instrument called a slit-lamp, enabling the doctor to look for signs of inflammation. 1 Laboratory tests may also be required to rule out infection and any other condition that may be causing the symptoms. 4",
    "uveitis_treatment": "Treatment for uveitis is aimed at reducing pain and inflammation, repairing any loss of vision and attempting to treat any underlying causes. The chosen treatment route will depend upon the specific type of the condition being experienced and what is causing it. In most cases, medication will be the primary treatment method, but in some cases surgery may also be required. Treatment will usually include: 1\n\nThe use of steroid medications (glucocorticoids, hormones based on cholesterol) is common in the treatment of uveitis. Steroids can be administered in different ways, with the chosen method depending on what type of the condition is being experienced. Steroid eye-drops: Typically used in the initial treatment of anterior uveitis when it is not caused by an infection. The severity of the condition will decide the prescribed dose and how often the drops should be administered. It is important to continue using the eye drops even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence. Steroid injections: Typically used in cases of intermediate or posterior uveitis or if steroid eye drops have proven unsuccessful. The injection is administered to the outside of the eyeball (periocular). A doctor will administer the injection using local anesthetic to minimize any pain or discomfort as much as possible. Generally, only one injection will be needed when the symptoms are at their worst. Steroid tablets: The strongest form of steroid medication, usually administered if other options have not worked. Side-effects can be severe, so steroid tablets will generally only be used if there is a risk of permanent damage to the eyes. It is important to continue using the tablets as prescribed even after symptoms have disappeared to prevent recurrence. The severity of the condition will determine how long an individual’s steroid tablet course will have to last, which could be anywhere between a number of weeks and,  in much rarer cases, up to a number of years.\n\nMydriatic eye drops may be prescribed in cases of anterior uveitis, in addition to steroid eye drops. This type of medication relaxes the muscles in the eye and thereby widens the pupil of the eye, helping to relieve pain and reduce the risk of glaucoma. They can, however, lead to a temporary blurring of vision.\n\nIf uveitis is being caused by an infection, this may be treated using either antibiotics, antiviral medication or antifungal medication. If the condition does not improve after using these medications, immunosuppressants may be prescribed. Immunosuppressants work by suppressing immune system responses, thereby disrupting the process of inflammation. There is, however, a risk of side effects. These may include: Skin rash Numbness Loss of appetite Nausea High blood pressure Headaches Breathlessness Concerned that you or a loved one may have this condition? Start your symptom assessment in the free Ada app .\n\nIn rare cases, surgery may be required to treat uveitis. This will typically be the case if the condition recurs frequently or if it is particularly severe. The surgical procedure used to treat uveitis is called a vitrectomy. During the procedure, the substance that fills the interior of the eye, the vitreous, is removed and temporarily replaced with air, gas or a liquid substitute. Eventually, the eye will naturally replace the substance by itself. 1 A vitrectomy can be carried out using either local or general (patient is asleep during the procedure) anesthetic and – like any surgical procedure – comes with some risk of complications.\n\nIn cases where other medical treatment options have been ineffective, a relatively new form of treatment called immunotherapy or biologic therapy may be prescribed. This involves the use of medications containing biological agents, i.e.natural antibodies, which can specifically target the eye area, treating the pain and inflammation associated with uveitis. The types of biologic medication most commonly used to treat uveitis are called infliximab and adalimumab. Biologic medications have the potential to improve an affected person’s quality of life. However, no long-term safety data has been collected about this form of treatment yet. Immunotherapy should therefore only be undertaken accompanied by close supervision from an experienced doctor.",
    "uveitis_complications": "If treatment for uveitis is not received quickly enough, complications can occur. Complications are more likely to occur in: People over 60 People with chronic uveitis People with intermediate, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis Some of the most common uveitis complications include: Glaucoma: Inflammation can cause pressure to be put on the eyes, leading to glaucoma. If left untreated, this can lead to a loss of vision. Cataracts : A clouding of the eye’s lens, which can be caused by inflammation or steroidal treatment methods. If left untreated, this can lead to a loss of vision. Detached retina: When the retina begins to pull away from the eye due to inflammation. This can lead to serious vision problems. Cystoid macular edema: Involving a buildup of fluid in the rear of the eye, leading to retinal swelling. This can lead to blurred vision. Posterior synechiae: When the iris sticks to the lens of the eye. It is most likely if treatment for uveitis is delayed. People experiencing possible uveitis complications should consult a doctor. In addition, the free Ada app can be used to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "other_names_for_uveitis": "Chorioretinitis (a of posterior uveitis) Iritis (a form of anterior uveitis)",
    "uveitis_faqs": "Q: What is the prognosis for a person with uveitis? A: With early and appropriate treatment, most cases of uveitis can be managed effectively. However, all types of uveitis can become chronic and recur frequently. If this is the case, individuals may be given eye drops in advance, allowing them to use them as soon as symptoms begin to occur. Uveitis caused by an infection tends to disappear once the infection has been properly treated, and does not recur. 1"

Many countries routinely vaccinate children against it , often in combination with the vaccines against measles , mumps and rubella . Nevertheless, chickenpox commonly affects children, with outbreaks most often occurring at kindergartens and elementary schools. It also frequently happens that the siblings, parents or caregivers of a child with chickenpox develop the condition, which is contagious. Adults and teenagers can contract chickenpox, particularly if they have not been vaccinated. Chickenpox can be a serious health problem for pregnant people , the immunosuppressed of any age and sometimes unvaccinated children. The most distinctive symptom of chickenpox is a blister-like, itchy rash. Other symptoms may include: Fever Headache Body aches. These three symptoms are known as a prodrome, meaning that they indicate a condition is developing, and often appear before the rash develops. Younger children often find the symptoms of chickenpox quite mild and may only be slightly uncomfortable. Teenagers and adults tend to experience symptoms of chickenpox more severely than children do. Children, adults and teenagers alike should not attend school or work while they have chickenpox, but should stay home until the rash has completely crusted over. Chickenpox usually resolves within five to ten days. Complications can develop, but these are not common. Potential complications include pneumonia, secondary bacterial infections and, rarely, encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain.

    "shingles_herpes_zoster": "While chickenpox commonly affects children, shingles is far more common among older adults. The primary symptom of shingles is a painful, blistering rash affecting one side of the face, trunk or a single limb. After the primary varicella zoster infection, or chickenpox, has resolved, the varicella virus remains in the body for life. It is usually inactive, but it can be reactivated later in life by stress or illness, especially conditions that lead to a weakened or suppressed immune system, such as cancer, organ transplants or advanced age. It is only possible to develop shingles if you have had chickenpox. When the virus reactivates, it travels up the nerve in which it has lain dormant to the surface of the skin, where it causes painful lesions. These are usually restricted to an area of the skin served by a particular nerve, known as a dermatome. The rash is therefore usually restricted to one particular area of the body and is usually unilateral rather than bilateral. Shingles is very uncomfortable and may become complicated in some cases, especially if it affects the ears or eyes or if a secondary bacterial infection affects the lesions. Shingles is treated with antivirals and pain-management medications, and most people recover well within two weeks. Some, however, experience ongoing pain and discomfort in the affected area; this is known as post-herpetic neuralgia. Learn more about Shingles »"

    "what_is_viral_conjunctivitis": "Conjunctivitis is the name for inflammation of the conjunctiva, which is the thin layer of tissue on the inside of the eyelids and which covers the white part of the eye. Also known as pink eye , conjunctivitis is often caused by a virus, for example, one of the varieties that causes the common cold, though it can be caused by bacteria (see bacterial conjunctivitis ) or allergies (see allergic conjunctivitis ) too. When pink eye is caused by a virus, it is called viral conjunctivitis. Like all types of pink eye, viral conjunctivitis is common but not usually serious. 1 2 3 Viral conjunctivitis typically begins in one eye and then spreads to the other. The main symptoms of viral conjunctivitis include: 4 5 6 Pinkness or, often, intense redness of the eye Burning, a sensation of grittiness, or mild pain or discomfort in the eye Watery discharge from the eye Swollen and/or reddened eyelids Other symptoms of viral infection, e.g. sore throat, runny nose, and other cold symptoms\n\nMost mild cases of viral conjunctivitis clear up on their own within a couple of weeks, without any specific treatment. Cleaning the eyes with water and a clean cloth or sterile pad, applying warm or cool compresses, and using lubricating eye drops, also known as artificial tears, may help to relieve symptoms. However, antiviral medications may be recommended for more serious cases of viral conjunctivitis. Antibiotics are not useful for treating viral pink eye. 2 4 5 6 Generally, people make a complete recovery, and viral conjunctivitis does not cause any complications. However, cases caused by certain viruses, such as herpes simplex, the cold sore virus, or varicella-zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles, can be serious and may cause lasting eye problems if not managed effectively. 1 Furthermore, if viral conjunctivitis occurs in newborn babies or people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV or are undergoing treatment for cancer, it can be severe, and medical advice should be sought without delay. 2 6 In addition, anyone experiencing severe symptoms should see a doctor immediately. These include: 2 5 6 Intense pain in the eye Extreme redness, especially in one eye only Inability to open the eye Severe sensitivity to light Difficulty seeing If symptoms are mild but do not improve within a week or so, medical advice should also be sought. Viral conjunctivitis can affect people of any age. It is highly contagious, which means that it can be spread easily from person to person. For this reason, it is important for people who have viral conjunctivitis to take steps to avoid passing on the infection to others, such as practicing good hygiene ( see the section on prevention ).",
    "symptoms": "Viral conjunctivitis often begins in one eye and spreads to the other within a day or two. Symptoms may include: 4 5 6 Pinkness or, typically, intense redness of the eye Burning, a sensation of grittiness or mild pain or discomfort in the eye Watery discharge from the eye, sometimes with a small amount of mucus Crustiness around the eyelids upon waking in the morning Swollen, red eyelids Slight sensitivity to bright light Swelling of the lymph nodes in front of the ears Other symptoms of viral infection, e.g. runny nose, sore throat and cough in the case of a cold\n\nMostly, viral conjunctivitis causes mild symptoms and does not affect a person’s vision, other than causing slight blurriness when discharge has built up on and around the eye. 7 Depending on the type of virus causing the infection, there may be additional symptoms, or only one eye may be affected. When only one eye is affected, it is called unilateral conjunctivitis. If symptoms are severe or vision is impaired, it is important to contact a doctor without delay. It is also extremely important to see a doctor if any signs of viral conjunctivitis are present in a newborn baby or a person whose immune system is weakened.",
    "causes": "The most common cause of viral conjunctivitis is infection with adenovirus, the group of viruses that cause the common cold and many other upper respiratory infections. 4 3 6 An adenovirus may cause conjunctivitis without causing any other symptoms in the body. However, in some cases adenoviral conjunctivitis may manifest as: 3 6 Pharyngoconjunctival fever: Which is common, mild and often seen in children and young adults who have recently had a cold or respiratory infection. Symptoms may include sore throat, fever and headache. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis: Which is less common, can be severe, affects the front of the eye (cornea) and may cause long-lasting vision difficulties. Also known as viral keratoconjunctivitis. Less common causes of viral conjunctivitis include: 4 3 6 7 Enteroviruses Herpes simplex virus , the cold sore virus, which usually affects only one eye Herpes zoster ophthalmicus , associated with shingles Molluscum contagiosum, also known as water warts Measles Mumps Rubella, also known as German measles Infectious mononucleosis HIV Conjunctivitis caused by some of the above, such as herpes simplex and herpes zoster, can be severe, and a person may need to be referred for specialist treatment to prevent complications.",
    "diagnosis": "When symptoms are mild, a diagnosis of viral pink eye can often be made without seeing a doctor, and the condition can be treated at home. However, if there is any uncertainty or concern over the condition, or the symptoms are severe, seeing a doctor is very important. 6 Causes for concern include: 2 5 6 Intense pain in the eye Extreme redness, especially in one eye only Inability to open the eye Severe sensitivity to light Discharge that contains a lot of pus Constant blurred vision, or difficulty seeing A doctor will take the person’s medical history and ask whether anyone they know might have had an eye infection recently. They will examine the eyes and assess the signs and symptoms present, taking care to rule out allergic conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, dry eye syndrome and other more serious eye conditions, such as uveitis and keratitis. 2 If the conjunctivitis seems severe or very long-lasting, the doctor may take a small sample of discharge from the eye and send it for laboratory tests to identify the cause and determine the most effective treatment approach. 2 7",
    "viral_conjunctivitis_treatment": "Mild cases of viral conjunctivitis often clear up within roughly 1-3 weeks without special medical treatment. Symptoms may become worse before getting better. A number of home remedies and over-the-counter treatments may help to relieve the discomfort caused by viral conjunctivitis: 2 6 1 Applying a cold or warm compress; a clean cloth that has been soaked in water; to the eye Gently clean discharge from the eye with a clean cloth, sterile pad, or cotton wool soaked in water Applying lubricating eye drops to the eye; these are called artificial tears and are available without a prescription. Care must be taken not to use the drops in the other eye if only one eye is infected Applying antihistamine/decongestant eye drops, which are often available without a prescription; these may help to reduce irritation 5 Avoiding the use of contact lenses until the infection has cleared Generally, it is not considered necessary for a child with viral conjunctivitis to stay off school, unless an outbreak of multiple cases has occurred. However, a particular daycare center or school may have their own policy and ask that the child be kept at home until their symptoms have cleared up, to reduce the likelihood of infecting other children. 6 Antibiotics are not recommended for the treatment of viral conjunctivitis, as they are not effective against viruses, but bacteria. 6\n\nSometimes, topical or oral antiviral medication may be recommended. This is typically reserved for cases of viral conjunctivitis which: 6 1 Are severe, such as those caused by the herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus Are very long-lasting Occur in newborn babies Occur in people who have weakened immune systems In epidemic keratoconjunctivitis and other serious types of viral conjunctivitis, steroid eye drops and other types of treatment may sometimes be necessary. 3 6 While steroid medication can be very effective, it can cause serious side-effects and complications and is generally only used short term.",
    "complications": "Most mild cases of viral conjunctivitis clear up completely, without causing any complications. However, in a small number of severe cases, the infection can cause serious complications, including: 6 Ulcers and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis) Scarring of the eye and damage to vision If a person experiences any severe symptoms, or is concerned about an eye infection, it is advisable that they see a doctor immediately.",
    "viral_conjunctivitis_in_babies": "Newborn babies can be affected by various types of conjunctivitis, including viral conjunctivitis. Pink eye in infants is called neonatal conjunctivitis or ophthalmia neonatorum. Babies with conjunctivitis typically develop puffy, red eyelids and discharge from the eyes within 1-14 days of birth. 6 8 A baby’s eyes may become infected with a virus from the mother during the childbirth process, including the cold virus (adenovirus) and the viruses that cause oral and genital herpes; herpes simplex 1 and herpes simplex 2. 8 9 Viral and other types of conjunctivitis in babies can be very serious, and urgent medical attention is required. Viral conjunctivitis in an infant may need to be treated with antiviral medication, and referral to a specialist may be necessary. 9 Conjunctivitis in a baby is sometimes mistaken for sticky eyes caused by a blocked tear duct. However, a blocked tear duct will not cause the redness or swelling seen in conjunctivitis. 6",
    "prevention": "While it may not always be possible to prevent viral conjunctivitis, taking the following steps can help to reduce the likelihood of an infection: 1 4 5 Avoiding contact with people who have pink eye Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer Avoiding touching your eyes when your hands are not clean If you have viral conjunctivitis, the following actions can help avoid spreading the infection to others: 1 2 4 5 Maintaining good hygiene, such as washing your hands often with soap and water, or using hand sanitizer, especially after treating the eyes Cleaning your spectacles Avoiding touching the eyes other than when treating them, as this can spread the virus Washing pillowcases and towels often and avoiding sharing them with others Avoiding sharing makeup and eyedrops When necessary, staying off school or work until symptoms of viral conjunctivitis have cleared; this is generally when the eyes are no longer red and irritated Avoiding the use of swimming pools In addition, contact lenses should not be worn until symptoms have cleared, and a new pair used when the infection has gone away. Some makeup may also need to be discarded and replaced to prevent reinfection. 1 2",

    "viral_conjunctivitis_faqs": "Q: How long is viral conjunctivitis contagious? A: A person with viral conjunctivitis is usually contagious from the time symptoms begin appearing and for the duration of the illness until it has cleared up. A general rule is that as long as the eyes are red, the virus may be spread. 10 Q: How is viral conjunctivitis spread? A: Viral conjunctivitis is readily spread through direct contact, for example, when a person with the condition touches their eyes and then touches an object, such as a door handle or another person’s hand. If that person then touches their eyes without washing or sanitizing their hands, they may develop viral conjunctivitis. Objects that are in contact with the eyes, e.g. towels or pillowcases, can also be contaminated easily. Viral conjunctivitis can also be spread through the sharing of eye drops, mascara, and other eye makeup, and via communal bathing, e.g. swimming pools, saunas, and hot tubs. 5 6 Q: Viral conjunctivitis vs. bacterial conjunctivitis – what is the difference? A: While both types of conjunctivitis are highly contagious, the causes, some of the symptoms, and the treatments are different. Viral conjunctivitis is caused by a virus, often one of the groups that cause the common cold , results in a watery discharge from the eye and generally has no specific treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by bacteria, results in a thick, sticky discharge from the eye, and may,  in some cases, require antibiotic eye drops. Q: Viral conjunctivitis vs. pink eye – what is the difference? A: Pink eye is the common term for all types of conjunctivitis. Viral conjunctivitis is one type of pink eye and refers to pink eye that is caused by a virus, e.g., from the group of viruses that cause the common cold. Other types of pink eye include bacterial conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis."

Viral meningitis is usually less severe than bacterial meningitis, though all suspected cases of meningitis should be assessed by a doctor. There are thought to be around 75,000 cases of viral meningitis in the United States each year, up to 50,000 of which require hospitalization. 1 2\n\nThere are a number of common viruses that can cause viral meningitis. Symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, irritability, loss of appetite and drowsiness. Viral meningitis is most common in newborns, young children and people with weakened immune systems. Although most people do not require any specific treatment for viral meningitis, some may need antiviral medications. The prognosis for someone with viral meningitis is generally good.\n\nWhereas viral meningitis is caused by a virus, bacterial meningitis is caused by certain bacterial infections and can be far more serious than viral meningitis. Bacterial meningitis includes the potentially lethal meningococcal disease. Because early symptoms of different types of meningitis can look similar, it is very important to be assessed by a doctor as soon as possible to identify the cause. 3 4 Read more about Bacterial Meningitis »",

Enteroviruses generally cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold or produce no symptoms at all. Babies and people with compromised immune systems are most likely to develop complications, such as viral meningitis from an enterovirus. 2 9 10 Herpes viruses, including the herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster (chickenpox) virus, are the next most common cause of viral meningitis. Herpes simplex virus 2, or HSV-2, is more associated with viral meningitis. Herpes simplex-related cases of viral meningitis may cause Mollaret meningitis and can be very serious for newborn babies . 11 12 Mumps and measles can cause viral meningitis. Due to a fall in vaccination rates in some areas, viral meningitis caused by mumps and measles is most often seen in young adult populations where immunization rates have fallen. 11 12 Other viruses that can cause viral meningitis include: 1 11 12 13 14 15 Arboviruses such as West Nile virus and dengue Japanese B encephalitis Tick-borne encephalitis Cytomegalovirus, mainly of risk to people with weakened immune systems HIV , occurring shortly after infection Lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or LCM, which is carried by rodents",

A needle is then inserted between two vertebrae to remove a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. A lumbar puncture should take no more than five minutes. 16 17 The cerebrospinal fluid will be tested to assess whether the meningitis is viral or caused by another organism, and also to identify the virus responsible. These results will inform treatment. 5 In some cases, other samples may be needed to identify which virus is causing the meningitis. These samples can include: 1 6 Blood Throat or nose swab Stool",
    "treatment": "Most people with viral meningitis will recover without treatment within 7 to 10 days. People with the condition may find over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol helpful to ease symptoms and should drink plenty of fluids. 1 An important early step in treating meningitis is to identify whether the condition is viral or bacterial in nature. As bacterial meningitis is typically more severe than the viral variety, it is likely that intravenous antibiotics will be promptly administered if it is suspected, even if it has not been fully confirmed through testing. Antibiotics are ineffective against viral meningitis. If viral meningitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, it should be treated intravenously with the antiviral drug acyclovir. 11 18 If a person displays signs of disturbed consciousness or any other neurological problems, acyclovir should be administered early to halt the potential development of encephalitis. People in an unstable condition should be admitted to a critical care unit for airway protection, neurological checks, and in order to help reduce the possibility of secondary complications. Treatment methods may be altered, depending on the results of gram staining, cultures, and other tests. Viral meningitis caused by enteroviruses or the herpes simplex virus is capable of causing viral septic shock in newborn babies and infants. For this reason, acyclovir and a broad range of other antiviral therapies should be introduced as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Antiretroviral drugs can be used to treat viral meningitis in people with HIV. 6",
    "preventing_viral_meningitis": "Protection against some viruses that cause viral meningitis can be obtained through vaccination, such as for mumps, measles, and varicella zoster. 1 There are no vaccinations for enteroviruses, but maintaining good hygiene practices, such as handwashing and avoiding close contact with people who are ill, can restrict their spread. 1 Using barrier devices, such as condoms, during sexual activity can help restrict the spread of herpes simplex viruses. 2 Taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as repellent sprays and clothes which cover arms and legs, can prevent the spread of some viruses carried by mosquitoes and which can cause viral meningitis. Some viruses, such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis, are primarily encountered while traveling. However, some mosquito-borne viruses, such as the West Nile virus, are found in the United States. 14",
    "complications": "In rare cases, viral meningitis can cause more serious conditions. People most at risk include babies less than one month old and people with compromised immune systems. Complications may include persistent headaches and a feeling of general illness (malaise), which may last for up to three weeks. Seizures are also possible and should be treated with intravenous anticonvulsant medications, such as lorazepam, phenytoin, and midazolam. In some instances of severe encephalitis, cerebral edema (fluid on the brain) may also occur. Treatment may involve intracranial pressure control through an infusion of mannitol, intravenous dexamethasone, or intubation. Viral meningitis caused by West Nile virus, Japanese B encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis can be life-threatening and cause long-term neurological problems. 11 Mollaret meningitis, also called Recurrent Lymphocytic Meningitis, is a rare form of viral meningitis that recurs repeatedly, separated by weeks or months without symptoms. People with Mollaret meningitis may also experience seizures, double vision, hallucinations, and other neurological problems. It is thought that the herpes simplex virus causes most cases. 17\n\nThe majority of people who experience viral meningitis will experience no long-term effects as a result of the condition. There is research to suggest, however, that a small percentage of affected people may develop short-term memory loss and behavioral changes. Children under the age of one may also develop slight neurological problems later in life. 12 People concerned about the long-term effects of meningitis should talk to their doctor.\n\nHerpes simplex virus affects around 1,500 to 2,000 newborn babies in the United States each year. If left untreated, the virus can cause viral meningitis. This condition can be life-threatening and can cause lasting brain damage. 18",
    "other_names_for_viral_meningitis": "Aseptic meningitis Viral meningoencephalitis",
    "viral_meningitis_faqs": "Q: Is viral meningitis contagious? A: Viral meningitis itself is not contagious, meaning it cannot be transmitted from person to person. However, some of the viruses that can cause viral meningitis, notably enteroviruses, are highly contagious, though only a small number of people with these viruses will go on to develop viral meningitis. Q: What is the difference between viral and bacterial meningitis? A: Viral meningitis and bacterial meningitis are caused by different organisms. Viral meningitis is caused by viruses and bacterial meningitis is caused by bacteria. Bacterial meningitis can be life-threatening within just a few hours of onset. While viral meningitis is usually far less serious, people in at-risk groups such as babies and immunocompromised people may experience significant complications. Q: Is there a vaccine for viral meningitis? A: There is no vaccine available for non-polio enteroviruses, the underlying cause of 85 percent of cases of viral meningitis. There are vaccines for other possible causes, such as the flu , measles, and chickenpox. It is advised that people stay up to date on their vaccinations to help prevent viral meningitis. 1"

    "condition": "Viral Sinusitis (Sinus Infection)",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/viral-sinusitis/",
    "what_is_sinusitis_sinus_infection": "Sinusitis , also referred to as sinus infection or rhinosinusitis , is inflammation of the sinuses. The sinuses are air-filled cavities within the bones in the face and nose; sinusitis occurs when these cavities become inflamed and blocked , leading to a buildup of mucus and air. It is a common condition, occurring in many cases following a cold. 1\n\nSymptoms of sinusitis include nasal discharge, a blocked nose, tenderness around the head and sinus headaches. Generally, sinusitis is a non-serious condition which can be managed through self-care methods and over-the-counter medication. In most cases, symptoms will disappear within two to three weeks.\n\nThere are two types of sinusitis: 2 Acute sinusitis is defined as an infection that develops suddenly and lasts for a short amount of time. This will typically be around a week, though a duration of two to three weeks is not uncommon. Individuals experiencing a cold will often also develop a mild case of acute sinusitis, with most people only experiencing severe acute sinusitis once or twice in their lifetime. Chronic sinusitis is far less common than acute sinusitis. It is defined as persistent sinusitis that lasts for over 12 weeks. In most cases, chronic sinusitis will develop from acute sinusitis.",
    "symptoms": "Sinusitis often develops following a cold . If the following symptoms are experienced at the same time as the various symptoms of a cold , it may indicate that sinusitis has developed: 3 4 Yellow or green nasal discharge A blocked or runny nose Pain and tenderness around the affected sinuses (commonly less severe in chronic sinusitis) Sinus pressure Fever (above 38 C / 100.4 F) Toothache A reduced sense of smell  (most common in chronic sinusitis) Bad breath In cases of chronic sinusitis, the severity of symptoms may vary over time . During an initial bout of acute sinusitis, symptoms may be severe, but fade over a number of days or weeks, leaving background symptoms such as mild sinus discomfort and stuffiness. Acute sinusitis may then redevelop, making symptoms once again severe. The Ada app can help you check your symptoms. Download the free app or find out more about how it works . Similar symptoms, such as sore throat, headache, and cough, can be present in both COVID-19 and sinus infections ( Read more information about the difference between COVID-19 and sinusitis symptoms here ).\n\nMost mild cases of sinusitis will not require a visit to the doctor. However, if the following symptoms occur, medical attention is advised: Symptoms are severe Symptoms are getting worse Frequent bouts of sinusitis are experienced",
    "causes": "The causes of acute and chronic sinusitis are typically different.\n\nIn the majority of cases, acute sinusitis is caused by a viral infection. This will typically be the same virus that has caused the preceding cold. The condition may also be caused by bacteria, although this is rare — only occurring in roughly 0.5 to 2 percent of cases. 5\n\nThe causes of chronic sinusitis are more multifaceted than the acute form of the condition. Although a viral infection may play a role in causing chronic sinusitis, long-term inflammation will often also have other contributing factors. 6 Medical experts have identified three general categories of chronic sinusitis, each with different causes: Chronic sinusitis without nasal polyposis: The most common form; typically caused by allergic reactions to airborne substances, irritation from airborne substances and infections. Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis: Nasal polyps are abnormal growths within the nose. When polyps become large or numerous, they can block the airways and cause sinusitis. The reasons why some people develop nasal polyps are largely unknown. Chronic sinusitis with fungal allergy: Air routinely contains small amounts of fungus, which most people can inhale without issue. Others, however, can experience an allergic reaction to this fungus, which causes a thick mucus to form in the sinuses. This can then lead to chronic sinusitis. Several factors can make an individual more prone to chronic sinusitis or make the symptoms worse when the condition is being experienced. These include: Allergies , especially those that are experienced all year round, can both increase one’s risk of chronic sinusitis and worsen its symptoms. These allergies include those to dust mites, animal hair and mold. Airborne irritants , including things like tobacco smoke and formaldehyde, can increase the risk of developing chronic sinusitis. People with an immune system disorder are at increased risk of developing chronic sinusitis.",
    "diagnosing_sinusitis_sinus_infection": "Most cases of sinusitis will resolve themselves in around one to three weeks and not require a visit to the doctor. However, if a person is concerned about their symptoms, symptoms are particularly severe or last longer than the normal timeframe, seeking medical attention is advised. Upon visiting a doctor, they will typically ask some questions about the symptoms being experienced and perform a physical examination . This may include an anterior rhinoscopy, which involves a doctor using a lighted instrument to examine the nose and sinuses. Through this, a doctor will usually be able to confirm a diagnosis of sinusitis. If the symptoms persist for longer than 12 weeks, a doctor will be able to confirm a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis. If chronic sinusitis is confirmed, further tests may be required to establish what form of the condition is being experienced. This may involve a nasal endoscopy, in which a lighted, flexible tube mounted with a camera is inserted into the nasal cavity and sinuses for examination purposes. 7",
    "sinusitis_sinus_infection_treatment": "Acute sinusitis and chronic sinusitis will typically require different treatment methods.\n\nIn most cases, acute sinusitis will not require any specialist treatment from a doctor. As the condition will typically resolve itself naturally in a number of weeks, a combination of self-care methods and over-the-counter medications is usually sufficient . These include: 8 Painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can help with pain relief. Decongestant nasal sprays can be effective in the short-term at resolving a blocked nose. However, long-term use (over 5-7 days) is not advised. Staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest is advised to aid recovery. Warm face packs or a warm flannel placed over the face can help ease congestion and a blocked nose. If the symptoms are particularly severe, a doctor may prescribe: Antibiotics may be prescribed in rare cases. As acute sinusitis is typically caused by a virus, antibiotics cannot be used as a cure. However, they may be prescribed when symptoms are severe; when an individual also has a heart problem, cystic fibrosis or a weak immune system; or when symptoms do not seem to be getting better or are worsening. Steroidal nasal sprays may be prescribed to help relieve particularly severe sinus inflammation.\n\nChronic sinusitis will generally require long-term management . Different people will require different treatment methods depending on which type of the condition is being experienced, its severity and whether any other conditions are also being experienced. Treatment methods include: 10 Lifestyle changes: People with chronic sinusitis who smoke cigarettes should quit, as smoke can aggravate the condition. Moreover, people with allergies which contribute to their condition should aim to limit their exposure to allergens. This may involve making environmental changes at home or in the workplace. Saline solution: Daily washing of the nasal passageways with a saline solution may be useful in helping to reduce inflammation. Steroid nasal sprays: Nasal sprays containing steroids are effective at reducing inflammation. Doctors will normally prescribe a course, with its length depending on the severity of the condition. If inflammation is very severe, steroid pills may be prescribed. However, this is not routine due to the risk of side-effects such as sleeping problems and acne. Antibiotics: In some cases, sinusitis may result from a bacterial infection . In these cases, antibiotics may be prescribed. The course will generally need to be prolonged (3-4 weeks). Over-the-counter medications: If the symptoms of acute sinusitis develop on top of the symptoms of chronic sinusitis, painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol can be effective at reducing pain. Decongestant nasal sprays can also be effective at relieving a blocked nose. These nasal sprays, however, provide only short-term relief and should not be used for more than 5-7 days at a time.\n\nTypically, surgery is seen as a last-resort treatment option, but may be necessary in some cases. Situations that may call for surgery include : When the use of medication has proven to be ineffective A CT scan shows there is evidence of persistent sinus disease Nasal polyps do not respond to treatment In cases of allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (which usually involves the complete blockage of one or more sinus) There is severe septum deviation Surgery is generally effective at reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms in the short term. However, even after surgery, chronic sinusitis will generally require lifelong management and the underlying causes of the condition will still need to be addressed.",
    "sinusitis_complications": "Complications as a result of chronic sinusitis are rare. In some cases, however, a sinus infection may spread to other areas, including the bones, blood and brain. This tends to be more common in children with the condition. Medical attention should be sought urgently if there is any swelling of the face, as this may be a sign of complications. 11",

    "faqs": "Q: What is a sinus headache? A: A sinus headache is a type of headache caused by inflammation of the sinuses, typically experienced as a symptom of sinusitis. The sensation associated with a sinus headache is a dull, throbbing pain in the upper section of the face (eyes, cheeks and forehead). Using painkillers, decongestants and drinking fluids can be effective at relieving the pain. 12 Q: Are there any home remedies for sinusitis? A: Various home remedies may be effective at relieving some of the symptoms of sinusitis. These include: Over-the-counter painkillers (such as ibuprofen and paracetamol) Over-the-counter decongestant nasal sprays A warm compress over the face Washing the nose with salt water"

    "condition": "Vitamin B12 Deficiency",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/vitamin-b12-deficiency/",
    "what_is_vitamin_b12_deficiency": "Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs when there are inadequate levels of the vitamin B12 in the body. This important vitamin is necessary for the production of red blood cells and the healthy functioning of the nervous system. A lack of vitamin B12 can cause anemia and other health problems. 1 2 Anemia is a condition where the body either cannot make enough healthy red blood cells or cannot produce enough of the substance hemoglobin that allows red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body. There are several different types of anemia, each with their own causes and symptoms. For example, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, a condition where the red blood cells are larger than normal and cannot function properly. 2 3 For many people, a balanced and varied diet provides all the vitamin B12 they need. 2 Good sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, eggs and dairy products. Despite the availability of vitamin B12 in a balanced diet, deficiency is not all that uncommon, particularly among people over 50 years of age, premenopausal women and people who follow strict vegan diets. 4 5\n\nLow levels of vitamin B12 may be the result of a number of different factors and conditions. One of the most common causes of vitamin B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia, a condition where a person’s immune system mistakenly reduces their ability to absorb the vitamin. Less common causes of deficiency include conditions affecting the stomach or intestines that interfere with absorption of vitamin B12, inadequate dietary intake, and certain medications. 1 Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency usually develop gradually and can be wide-ranging. These may include general symptoms of [anemia]((/conditions/anemia/), such as fatigue and lethargy, as well as the symptoms specific to the deficiency, such as yellow tinge to the skin and a sore tongue. If left untreated, the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency tend to worsen and irreversible problems involving the nerves and brain may develop. The risk of experiencing a number of serious complications, including heart failure, may also increase. 3 6 For this reason, it is important to seek medical advice without delay should any of these symptoms be present.",
    "symptoms": "A person with vitamin B12 deficiency may notice general symptoms of anemia as well as symptoms that are more specific to the condition. Symptoms more specific to a vitamin B12 deficiency include: 2 7 6 8 Pale yellow skin color Painful, red tongue Mouth ulcers and canker sores Constipation Pins and needles, numbness or other strange sensations in the hands, legs or feet Vision disturbances Difficulty walking and balance problems Perceptible differences in mood, thoughts, feelings and behavior Confusion and difficulty thinking. In severe cases, dementia Memory loss Irritability Depression Psychosis 3 The symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can develop slowly and worsen over time. Some symptoms may be experienced by people who have a vitamin B12 deficiency without anemia. Some people may experience no symptoms, despite low levels of vitamin B12. 6 Because of the wide range of possible symptoms, many of which can also occur as a result of other conditions, vitamin B12 deficiency may not be recognized immediately. 8 If a person has any reason to suspect the condition, it is important that they inform their healthcare practitioner. In babies, signs of vitamin B12 deficiency may include failure to thrive, movement difficulties, delays in reaching developmental milestones, and anemia. 7\n\nA person with vitamin B12 deficiency may also notice general symptoms of anemia . Symptoms that are commonly experienced in anemia, regardless of the cause, include the following: 6 Fatigue Lethargy Breathlessness Faintness Headaches Less common symptoms of anemia may include: 2 Paleness Palpitations Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) Loss of appetite Altered sense of taste Unexplained weight loss",
    "what_causes_vitamin_b12_deficiency": "Pernicious anemia is a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. There are several other possible causes of the deficiency, but they tend to be less common. 2\n\nIn order for vitamin B12 to be absorbed by the body, it needs to be combined with a protein called intrinsic factor in the stomach. This protein is produced by cells in the stomach lining. In people with pernicious anemia, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks these cells, preventing intrinsic factor from combining with vitamin B12 and hampering its absorption. 2 6 Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition that most commonly affects people over 50 years old, and women seem to be more likely to develop it. Pernicious anemia is thought to run in families and seems to affect people who have other autoimmune conditions, such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and Addison’s disease, more often than those who do not. A healthcare practitioner can order a blood test to check for pernicious anemia. 2 6\n\nPeople who have certain conditions that affect the stomach and intestines, or have had certain types of surgery, may be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. 2 6 Stomach conditions. Atrophic gastritis , which causes thinning of the stomach lining, infection with Helicobacter pylori bacteria, and a genetic condition that causes a lack of intrinsic factor can all cause vitamin B12 deficiency. Intestinal conditions. Crohn’s disease, a condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract , celiac disease, 7 chronic tropical sprue and a number of other conditions may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency. Surgery. Surgical procedures that remove part or all of the stomach, or the end of the small intestine, may prevent adequate absorption of vitamin B12.\n\nSome medicines can interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12, potentially leading to a deficiency if precautions are not taken. Metformin, a medicine commonly prescribed for diabetes, is one example. Others include neomycin, chloramphenicol, 7 colchicine and certain anticonvulsant drugs. 2 In addition, the long-term use of certain medicines that are used to treat stomach conditions, such as heartburn and peptic ulcers , 9 can worsen an existing vitamin B12 deficiency, but do not cause it. Examples of these drugs include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2 blockers. 2 6\n\nThough fairly uncommon, some people may develop vitamin B12 deficiency as a result of low levels in their daily diet. A balanced diet typically provides sufficient vitamin B12; however, strict vegans and people with a poor diet are at higher risk of developing a deficiency. 2 6 Good sources of vitamin B12 include: Meat Fish Eggs Dairy products In addition, some breakfast cereals, soy products and other foods are fortified with vitamin B12. Fruit and vegetable products do not contain vitamin B12, unless they have been specially fortified. 1 7 In healthy people, the body tends to have a store of vitamin B12 that can last two to five years without being replenished. As a result, a deficiency may take several years to develop. 6 10 It is important that people making long-term dietary changes, for example becoming vegan, eat food products that have been fortified with vitamin B12 or take a supplement to reduce the risk of developing a deficiency. 8",
    "diagnosis": "A doctor will typically take the person’s medical history and perform a physical examination. If they suspect a vitamin B12 deficiency, they will usually request blood tests to be done. These tests can measure levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid, as well as the size and concentration of hemoglobin within the person’s red blood cells. 6\n\nSome people experience symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency despite their blood tests indicating normal levels. The test measures the total amount of the vitamin in the blood, but not all of it can necessarily be used by the body. 6 In addition, the range of normal levels may differ between laboratories. For these reasons, healthcare practitioners will usually consider signs and symptoms, as well as the results of the blood tests when diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency. Read more about Blood Test Results »\n\nIf vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected or confirmed, further tests may be required to identify the cause. This will help to determine the recommended course of treatment. These investigations may include further blood tests for pernicious anemia 6 and other conditions. Some people may be referred to specialists for further tests or treatment. These include hematologists, doctors specializing in blood conditions, and gastroenterologists, doctors specializing in the digestive system. 1\n\nA deficiency of folate, the nutrient also known as folic acid or vitamin B9, good sources of which include foods like broccoli, asparagus, peas and brown rice, can cause some of the same symptoms as vitamin B12 deficiency. 6 For this reason, a doctor will typically examine the levels of folate in blood tests when checking for vitamin B12 deficiency. 3 Taking a lot of folic acid can mask the symptoms of a vitamin B12 deficiency, so in cases where folate deficiency is suspected, a doctor will usually test for vitamin B12 deficiency before prescribing medication. 10 Read more about Folate Deficiency »\n\nSometimes blood tests will show normal serum levels of vitamin B12, but a person may experience symptoms and complications related to a deficiency. This can be known as fuctional vitamin B12 deficiency. In these cases, there may be an issue with the processing of vitamin B12 in the body. Like most other cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, the condition can be treated with high doses of vitamin B12. 6 However, a prolonged functional vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to the same problems as a regular vitamin B12 deficiency.",
    "treatment": "Treatment will depend on the reasons for the vitamin B12 deficiency. In most cases, having injections or taking a prescribed oral supplement will be sufficient to treat the condition. 6 A doctor may recommend having high-dose injections of vitamin B12, usually in a form called hydroxocobalamin, every second day for two weeks, or until symptoms have cleared. If the cause of the deficiency is dietary, the doctor may advise taking a daily supplement or continuing to have injections twice a year or more, indefinitely. 6 They may also refer the person to a dietician for advice on ways to increase vitamin B12 intake in their diet. 1 3 In cases where the deficiency is not related to a person’s diet, it will usually be necessary to have vitamin B12 injections every three months or more frequently, for the rest of their life. 6 People who have symptoms that affect their nervous system, such as pins and needles or numbness, may be referred to a hematologist for specialized management of the deficiency. It may be necessary for them to have injections every two months or more frequently, for life. 2 6 Vitamin B12 injections typically do not have any side-effects other than a small amount of discomfort where the needle is inserted. 2 Follow-up blood tests will generally be requested one to three months after starting treatment, to check that vitamin B12 levels have returned to normal. Thereafter, a doctor may advise a once-yearly follow-up test. 6 3 10 In most cases, a vitamin B12 deficiency is easy to treat and complications are rare. 1 However, in some cases, particularly where there has been a severe or prolonged deficiency, nerve damage may be permanent and irreversible. 2 3 9",
    "prevention": "While it may not be possible to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency in all cases, steps can be taken to reduce the likelihood of the condition developing. A person should speak to their healthcare practitioner about getting their vitamin B12 levels checked periodically if they: 8 Use a proton pump inhibitor on a long-term basis Use an H2 blocker on a long-term basis Take metformin for their diabetes Are strict vegans Have conditions affecting the stomach Have had gastric surgery or surgery on the small intestine People with conditions that may interfere with the absorption of the vitamin, such as celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, as well as those over the age of 50, should also discuss their vitamin B12 needs with a healthcare practitioner. 8 It is recommended that strict vegans (and sometimes vegetarians) and people over 50 include breads, cereals or other food products that have been fortified with vitamin B12 in their diet, and/or take a supplement. 8",
    "complications": "Occasionally, a vitamin B12 deficiency can cause complications. These depend on the severity and duration of the deficiency, but may include: 6 3 Neurological problems. These may include vision disturbances, memory loss, pins and needles, difficulty walking or speaking, and damage to the nerves (peripheral neuropathy), particularly in the legs. Occasionally, some of these problems may be irreversible. Infertility. A vitamin B12 deficiency may cause women to be unable to fall pregnant. However, this is usually reversible with treatment. Stomach cancer. In cases of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by pernicious anemia, the risk of developing stomach cancer may be increased. Neural tube defects. Pregnant women with a vitamin B12 deficiency may be at an increased risk of their baby developing serious birth defects such as spina bifida. In addition, anemia of all kinds can sometimes cause serious heart and lung complications. These include a fast heartbeat and heart failure. 3 Read more about anemia complications » To prevent complications, people who suspect they may have a vitamin B12 deficiency are advised to consult a qualified healthcare practitioner without delay.",

    "vitamin_b12_deficiency_faqs": "Q: Are vegetarians and vegans at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency? A: Yes. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products like meat, fish, and dairy, but not plant products, meaning that people following a vegan or vegetarian diet are at an increased risk of developing a vitamin B12 deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake. 4 6 To minimize the likelihood of a deficiency, it is recommended that strict vegans and vegetarians include foods that have been fortified with vitamin B12 in their daily diet. Examples include certain breads, soy products and cereals, as well as certain yeast extracts. It may also be necessary to take a daily supplement. Q: Can vitamin B12 deficiency cause depression? A: Yes. A vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a wide range of symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms like irritability, psychosis, and depression. 3 It is important to remember that depression can be caused by a number of different factors. If a person suspects that a vitamin B12 deficiency may be implicated in their depressed mood, they are advised to speak to a healthcare practitioner. Q: Is there a link between alcohol and vitamin B12 deficiency? A: Yes. Research shows that even moderate alcohol consumption may decrease vitamin B12 levels, and alcoholics are thought to be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. In some cases, blood tests may show falsely high levels of vitamin B12; this confusing status can be caused by alcoholic liver disease and may mask a functional vitamin B12 deficiency. 11 12 13"

    "condition": "Vitamin D Deficiency",
    "url": "https://ada.com/conditions/vitamin-d-deficiency/",
    "what_is_vitamin_d_deficiency": "Vitamin D deficiency is also known as hypovitaminosis D . It is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, 1 affecting people of all age groups. 2 Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins ‒ essential compounds on which the body’s cells rely for normal development. Nearly every cell in the body has a receptor for vitamin D. 3 Vitamin D levels in the body can be maintained in two ways: The body can, itself, make vitamin D from its resources of cholesterol. To do this, it needs access to sunlight. Vitamin D can be found in certain foods, such as fatty fish. (However, it is rare for a person to gain all the vitamin D that their body needs from food alone.) Some of the most important functions of vitamin D include: Maintenance of normal calcium and phosphate levels Promotion of calcium absorption (essential for healthy bones and teeth) Growth of cells and bones Reduction of inflammation, such as can be caused by infection or injury When a person has vitamin D deficiency, the body's cells become less efficient at carrying out processes such as growth and regeneration.",
    "vitamin_d_deficiency_symptoms": "If the body does not contain sufficient vitamin D , this can give rise to a variety of health complications. Symptoms arising from vitamin D deficiency include fatigue, depressed mood and bone and muscle pain. Vitamin D is particularly instrumental in maintaining healthy bones. The development or worsening of skeletal disorders ‒ such as osteoporosis in adults and rickets in children ‒ are therefore often linked to vitamin D deficiency. Read more about Osteoporosis » Read more about Rickets » The most common signs that a person may be affected by vitamin D deficiency are: 4 5 Bone pain, sometimes also felt as joint pain Fatigue Muscle pain Hair loss Being affected by frequent bacterial and viral infections Mood changes such as a depressed mood Wounds and injuries taking longer to heal Weaker and/or easily breaking bones If you are experiencing vitamin D deficiency symptoms, use the Ada app to carry out a symptom assessment.",
    "causes": "The daily intake of vitamin D a person needs in order for their body to function optimally depends on factors such as age, weight, skin color, and their overall health. People whose bodies require a greater intake of vitamin D are at greater risk of experiencing vitamin D deficiency. Being an infant or an elderly person, being obese, having darker skin and/or experiencing a health condition which compromises one’s ability to absorb vitamins properly (such as Coeliac disease or inflammatory bowel diseases) are all factors which may increase the daily quantity of vitamin D an individual requires. Factors which increase the likelihood of being affected by vitamin D deficiency include: Living in countries where there is little sun all year round Having darker skin (the more pigmented a person’s skin is, the better it is able to produce melanin, which absorbs UVB radiation and reduces the synthesis of vitamin D) 6 Wearing high-factor sunscreen Spending the majority of one’s time indoors Malabsorption as a result of conditions such as Coeliac disease which impede the normal uptake of nutrients Avoiding foods which provide a source of vitamin D such as fatty fish and dairy products Being obese Being elderly The main source of vitamin D is exposure to solar UVB radiation (from sunlight). 4 When the body is exposed to sunlight, it can manufacture vitamin D from cholesterol, a fatty substance synthesized by the liver and found in some foods. Anything that reduces a person’s access to solar UVB radiation will compromise the body’s ability to manufacture sufficient levels of vitamin D, ref4 therefore eventually causing vitamin D deficiency.\n\nVitamin D deficiency can be caused by failing to gain sufficient amounts of vitamin D from one's diet, leading to insufficient levels in the body overall. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is: 7 400 IU (international units) for children under one year 600 IU for children, teens and adults up to age 70 800 IU for pregnant people and adults over the age of 71 To increase a person’s chances of meeting the vitamin D target for their age group, healthcare professionals advise everybody to ensure that their diet contains sources of vitamin D – which can be found in certain foods, especially in fatty fish, such as salmon or tuna, and certain dairy products, like milk and cheese. However, most foods that contain vitamin D do not contain sufficient quantities to meet a person’s daily required intake. For this reason, many traditionally consumed sources of vitamin D (for example, formulated milk for infants, orange juice and soy milk) are fortified with vitamin D. Failing to eat regular or sufficient quantities of vitamin-D-containing food (for example, because of following a vegan diet) increases the likelihood of developing vitamin D deficiency. Even with a vitamin-D-rich diet, it is not usually possible for a person to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D in their body from food alone. For this reason, vitamin D deficiency is a very common problem worldwide.\n\nFor some people, particularly those who ensure that their food contains vitamin D, exposure to sunlight will be sufficient for them to synthesize the rest of their recommended daily amount of vitamin D. Many people – particularly those living far from the equator or whose lifestyles involve staying indoors and/or wearing clothes which cover most of the skin – may need to take supplements of vitamin D to meet their required daily amount. If they do not do so, this can cause vitamin D deficiency.",
    "diagnosis": "If vitamin D deficiency is suspected, it is important to visit a doctor in order to confirm the diagnosis, so that one can begin treatment as soon as possible and redress any problems incurred as a result of the deficiency. It is not standard medical practice to screen symptomless people for vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, it is common for people to be unaware that they are vitamin D deficient, or that they need to take supplements, until they begin to experience health problems related to their vitamin D deficiency, such as hair loss, bone and/or muscle pain, fatigue or depression. To confirm a suspected diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency, one’s doctor will perform a blood test (called 25-hydroxy vitamin D test) , measuring the serum 25(OH)D levels in the blood. This will determine whether a person has sufficient or insufficient levels of vitamin D. Read more about Blood Test Results » If an individual is suspected of having had long-term vitamin d deficiency, doctors will look for physical characteristics which are indicators of a long-term vitamin D deficiency. Physical signs that a person may be affected by long-term vitamin D deficiency include: 1 Widening of the ends of the bones Skeletal deformities including bow legs and expanded rib-cage Slow tooth development and/or early dental caries In diagnosing vitamin D deficiency, a healthcare professional will also assess a person’s medical history, diet and lifestyle to ascertain whether they have a history of health problems which could be related to vitamin D deficiency, like chronic liver or chronic kidney disease, and how likely they are to access sufficient sources of vitamin D on a day-to-day basis.",
    "vitamin_d_deficiency_treatment": "People diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency must begin treatment as soon as possible to redress the health complications which may be caused by the condition. Treatment for vitamin D deficiency normally involves supplementing a person’s nutritional intake in order to ensure that they receive the quantity of vitamin D that they need for their cells to function healthily. The correct course of vitamin D supplementation will be decided in relation to the age of the individual, their medical history and any health conditions they may be experiencing. Supplementation methods to treat vitamin D deficiency may include: 8 Oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in the form of a liquid, capsules or tablets Oral calcium and vitamin D combined supplements (usually in the form of tablets) Intramuscular vitamin D replacement therapy (a course of injections) Once a plan to restore a person’s vitamin D levels to a healthy score has been devised, the doctor will consider whether any additional treatments are necessary in order to manage and/or cure any additional conditions which may have arisen as a result of the vitamin D deficiency.",
    "prevention": "In order to prevent vitamin D deficiency, doctors recommend getting as much access to sunlight as possible (with adequate precautions to prevent sunburn) and ensuring that one maintains a balanced diet which includes regular intake of sources of vitamin D. Foods which contain or are commonly fortified with vitamin D include: Oily fish. Trout, salmon, herring, sardines, pilchards, kippers, tuna. Cod liver oil. This contains a large amount of vitamin D and should not be taken in conjunction with supplements containing vitamin D. Fortified dairy products. Dairy-based spreads and cheese can be fortified with vitamin D. Check the nutritional information on the packet to ascertain the vitamin D content of individual products. Infant formula is generally fortified with vitamin D. Fortified soy products. Soy-based products such as soy milk and soy yoghurt can be fortified with vitamin D. Check the nutritional information on the packet to ascertain the vitamin D content of individual products. Natural animal products. Raw milk, meat and egg yolk are sources of vitamin D. Good to know: It is important to note that the vitamin D content of animal products will vary according to the season. Animal products contain more vitamin D during the spring and summer months because the livestock – and the plant material they feed on – is exposed to more sunlight and thus has greater potential to synthesize vitamin D.\n\nA recent evaluation of the treatment and prevention of vitamin D deficiency, undertaken on behalf of the Endocrine Society , found that most people do not achieve a sufficient intake of vitamin D from their diet and access to sunlight alone. It is therefore recommended that most people use vitamin D supplements as a means of ensuring that they reach their recommended daily intake, so as to prevent vitamin D deficiency. 9 The recommended daily intake of vitamin D supplement for each age group is: 7 400 IU (international units) for children under one year 600 IU for children, teens and adults up to age 70 800 IU for pregnant people and adults over age 71 Individuals should consult their doctor to establish the dosage that is appropriate for them. People may need more potent supplements of vitamin D in order to reach their required intake if they: Live in countries far from the equator, for example, in Canada or middle or northern European countries which have little daylight in the winter months Have a lifestyle which involves spending the majority of their time indoors Usually wear clothing which covers the majority of their skin In order to prevent hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D toxicity) which can occur if a person’s vitamin D levels are too high, it is also advisable to consult a healthcare professional before starting vitamin D supplements in order to ensure that one is not at risk of consuming too much vitamin D.\n\nit is important to note that one should never become sunburnt in one’s efforts to spend time outdoors for the purpose of increasing one’s levels of vitamin D. Going without adequate sun protection carries significant health risks. For example, it increases the likelihood of developing severe forms of skin cancer such as melanoma . Becoming sunburnt as a result of spending time in the sun is never recommended. One should ensure that one always takes care to wear appropriate sun protection for one’s skin type, as well as following the general recommendations, such as wearing high-factor sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat.",
    "complications": "It is important to consult a healthcare professional if one suspects vitamin D deficiency, because the condition increases the likelihood of developing certain problems. The most commonly experienced problems related to vitamin D deficiency are skeletal disorders; diseases related to the growth and strength of one’s bones. In children, vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets , a condition involving the weakening and softening of the bones. In adults, the equivalent to rickets is known as osteomalacia (soft bones). Being deficient in vitamin D can also render the body less robust and heighten the likelihood of accidents occurring: Vitamin D deficiency increases the likelihood of breaking a bone in people of any age Elderly people with hypovitaminosis D are more likely to fall, trip or stumble Health complications which are associated with vitamin D deficiency include: 10 Osteomalacia (softening of the bones in adults) and osteoporosis (increased fragility of the bones) 11 Rickets (softening of the bones in children) Mental health conditions such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression 12 Increased susceptibility to infections and illnesses Glucose intolerance 13 and type 1 and type 2 diabetes 10 Obesity 14 Cardiovascular diseases (conditions affecting the heart) such as hypertension , heart failure and ischemic heart disease 15 16 Cancer of the colon, breast or prostate 17 Rheumatoid arthritis 18 Multiple sclerosis 18 19 Hair loss (alopecia) 20 Tuberculosis 21\n\nRickets , a condition involving the softening of the bones, so that the skeleton develops deformities is a very common condition related to vitamin D deficiency and affects children worldwide. 22 In children, vitamin D deficiency primarily causes skeletal diseases because the growth of the skeleton demands certain levels of calcium, and lacking vitamin D impairs the body’s uptake of calcium. Vitamin D deficiency can therefore cause hypocalcemia (where the levels of calcium in the body are too low), which in turn can cause rickets and osteoporosis. Children experiencing hypocalcemia as a result of vitamin D deficiency may exhibit additional symptoms and health problems, such as seizures or tetany (muscle spasms). 23 If you are concerned that your child, or a child you know, may be affected by vitamin D deficiency, get a free symptom assessment by downloading the Ada app .\n\nVitamin D deficiency is linked to a range of possible complications relating to pregnancy and the health of the pregnant person and the newborn. Complications which may arise for a pregnant person experiencing vitamin D deficiency include: 24 Gestational diabetes and less efficient metabolism of glucose Bacterial vaginosis Preeclampsia Premature birth Increased likelihood of needing a cesarean delivery The need of the developing fetus for vitamin D increases during the second half of pregnancy, when most of the bone growth prior to birth takes place. Because a developing fetus is entirely dependent on a passive transfer of vitamin D (from the pregnant person), it is important for pregnant people to ensure that their vitamin D intake is sufficient to support the needs of the fetus in addition to their own. In newborns, vitamin D deficiency can lead to conditions including: Low birth weight Rickets Abnormal bone growth Increased likelihood of skeletal fractures\n\nit is important to ensure that a breastfeeding person maintains adequate levels of vitamin D to support the healthy growth of a newborn in the postnatal period. For most newborns, breast milk is their primary source of vitamin D. However, not all breast milk will contain sufficient levels of vitamin D to provide an infant with their recommended vitamin D intake (400 IU per day). If the amount of vitamin D present in breast milk is not sufficient, It is possible for infants to develop vitamin D deficiency, particularly if they: Lack exposure to sunlight (because of staying indoors, wearing clothing which usually covers most of the skin or living far from the equator) Live in weather conditions with intense cloud covering Live in a highly polluted area The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends) that a daily supplement of 400 IU should be given to all breastfeeding infants, to safeguard against vitamin D deficiency. However, recent research indicates that if a mother takes a supplement with a sufficiently high concentration of vitamin D (around 6,400 IU), her breast milk will contain high enough levels of vitamin D to provide an infant with their recommended daily intake. 25 This removes the need to give a supplement to an infant directly.\n\nPeople with vitamin D deficiency are likely to experience ageing more rapidly than those with sufficient vitamin D intake. In the elderly, a deficit of vitamin D is associated with an increased likelihood that the health problems one does experience may be difficult to treat and/or result in death more likely than without a vitamin D deficiency. Among other factors, this is because elderly people who have vitamin D deficiency are also more likely to experience cognitive impairment, compromised muscle function and are more prone to falls.",
    "vitamin_d_deficiency_faqs": "Q: Does vitamin D deficiency increase the likelihood of gaining weight? A: Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to year-round weight gain and to difficulty losing weight. People with stable and sufficient levels of vitamin D for their age and body type find it easier to maintain a healthy weight and lose weight as desired. 26 People who are putting on unwanted weight and/or struggling to lose weight despite an appropriate diet and exercise plan may be experiencing vitamin D deficiency and should consult a healthcare professional to learn if any supplements are needed. Q: Is it possible to regrow hair in cases when hair loss is caused by vitamin D deficiency? A: Various studies have investigated the role of vitamin D in promoting hair growth and strength and have found a link between healthy hair and sufficient levels of vitamin D. Correspondingly, hypovitaminosis D can be a contributing factor to experiencing hair loss (alopecia). However, if one experiences hair loss as a result of vitamin D deficiency, it is likely that one will need specific treatments which are designed to promote hair re-growth to replace the lost hair. The process of replacing hair, that has been lost due to vitamin D deficiency, may involve specialised medications and/or surgery. Ensuring that one’s vitamin D intake is suitable will help to promote the effectiveness of any treatments for hair loss which a person undergoes 27 and will help to prevent further hair loss. Q: What happens when a person takes more than their recommended daily intake of vitamin D? A: When a person’s regular intake of vitamin D is greater than the recommended daily dose, this can result in hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D toxicity), a rare but potentially serious condition that results from having much higher than recommended levels of vitamin D in one’s body. This can stimulate the development of a range of different health complications, 28 including excessive thirst and urination, dehydration, high blood pressure, nausea and vomiting. Long-term hypervitaminosis D can result in serious problems, including cardiovascular malfunctions, calcification (hardening) of the arteries and soft tissues, and kidney problems. Hypervitaminosis D is usually the result of taking too many supplements of vitamin D. 29 It is therefore important to consult one’s doctor before starting to use a selection of different supplementary products, so as to ensure that there is no significant overlap between the kinds of nutritional compounds that they provide. Cod liver oil, for example, has a high vitamin D content and should therefore not be taken in conjunction with any other supplementary sources of vitamin D."

    "what_is_vitamin_k_deficiency": "Vitamin K is an essential fat-soluble vitamin which is important to bone and heart health, as well as blood clotting and brain function. A deficiency of vitamin K is rare in healthy adults due to its presence in a variety of common dietary sources, including green leafy vegetables, oils and grains. While newborn babies are particularly at risk, people of any age can develop a vitamin K deficiency, which may be triggered by a number of factors, including liver disease, malnutrition and as a consequence of taking certain prescription drugs. 1 Vitamin K deficiency is quite rare in infants today, because vitamin K prophylaxis is routinely given to babies at birth in many parts of the world. The deficiency is more common in infants who are completely breastfed, as baby milk formula generally contains supplementary vitamin K. 2 The main symptoms of a vitamin K deficiency include bruising easily and excess bleeding. A nutritionally balanced diet is normally sufficient to prevent vitamin K deficiency. If a deficiency of vitamin K does develop, it can usually be treated effectively if detected early.",
    "vitamin_k_deficiency_symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of a vitamin K deficiency include: 2 3 Excessive bleeding, e.g. from a cut, wound, injection or puncture Easy bruising Heavy menstrual bleeding If you think that you or a loved one might have signs of vitamin K deficiency, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms.\n\nInfants are at an increased risk of developing a vitamin K deficiency until they begin to eat regular foods, which will usually be around four to six months after birth. Signs and symptoms that could indicate vitamin K deficiency in babies include: 4 5 6 7 8 Bruising, especially around the head or face Bleeding episodes, e.g. around the belly button, nose and mouth, penis if circumcised and at vaccination sites Paleness, which may be noticeable in the gums of darker-skinned infants Yellowing of the skin and eyes, occurring three or more weeks after birth, distinct from newborn jaundice , which typically clears by the time the baby is two weeks old 9 Stool that is bloody, dark or sticky like tar Blood in the urine or vomit Irritability Excessive tiredness or sleepiness\n\nInfants with a vitamin K deficiency are susceptible to vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), also known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a rare condition which stems from the blood being unable to clot. 5 The bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, including internally, for example in the gastrointestinal tract, and brain. Bleeding into the brain is particularly common with late-onset VKDB. If bleeding is internal, it can be extremely difficult to notice and may lead to serious complications and even death. Signs are not always obvious and may be mistaken for other conditions. 4 6 VKDB is classified as one of three types according to when it develops: 5 10 Early-onset VKDB, which develops within 24 hours of the infant being born Classic-onset VKDB, which develops within 2-7 days of the infant being born Late-onset VKDB, which develops between two weeks and six months after birth, most commonly in babies who have not been given a vitamin K shot In addition to the symptoms listed above, signs of VKDB in babies may include: 4 5 6 7 8 Poor feeding Low weight or difficulty gaining weight\n\nIf any unusual symptoms are present or vitamin K deficiency is suspected, a medical professional should be contacted immediately. To help prevent VKDB and other potential complications of low vitamin K levels, vitamin K is routinely given by injection or orally to all infants at birth, in many parts of the world.\n\nFactors that increase an infant’s chances of developing VKDB include: 11 Breastfeeding. Children who are exclusively breastfed are roughly 20 times more likely to experience VKDB. This is due to the low levels of vitamin K in breast milk compared to formula milk, as well as the low levels of bacteria that help the body synthesize vitamin K. However, breastfeeding has many other benefits, and concern about vitamin K deficiency is no reason not to do it, as the routine administration of vitamin K to newborns significantly reduces the risk of VKDB. Pharmaceuticals. Certain medication taken by the mother can increase the chances of an infant developing VKDB. These include rifampicin, isoniazid, anticoagulants and anticonvulsant agents. Warm environments. Extended exposure to a warm environment can make late-developing VKDB more likely. Late-developing VKDB usually peaks at around 3-8 weeks. Liver disease. There is increased risk if an infant has an unsuspected liver disease, especially alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Malabsorption. An inability to absorb vitamins due to factors and conditions such as cystic fibrosis , celiac disease and long-lasting diarrhea.\n\nA vitamin K supplement should be given to the infant as soon as VKDB is suspected. In severe cases, fresh frozen plasma, a blood product containing coagulating properties, may also be administered. If an infant has lost a large amount of blood, a blood transfusion may also be necessary. To help prevent VKDB from occurring, a vitamin K supplement in the form of phytonadione is routinely given, with parental permission, to infants after birth in many parts of the world, including the United States and United Kingdom. It is sometimes called “the vitamin K shot”, but may be administered orally. The procedure is considered safe by healthcare professionals. 1 4 12 13 14",
    "vitamin_k_deficiency_causes_and_risks": "A vitamin K deficiency can occur in people of any age, but newborn infants are particularly at risk. Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to result from a lack of vitamin K reaching the fetus before birth and the lack of vitamin K in breast milk. Other risk factors for a vitamin K deficiency include: 1 15 Liver disease Conditions that affect the body’s ability to absorb vitamin K, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and tropical sprue Biliary tract disease Malnutrition Certain drugs, such as coumarin anticoagulants, cholestyramine, salicylates, rifampin and barbiturates It should be emphasized that a vitamin K deficiency in healthy adults is rare due to the vitamin’s presence in a variety of food sources, notably green leafy vegetables, oils and grains.",
    "vitamin_k_deficiency_diagnosis": "Diagnosing a deficiency of vitamin K will typically begin with a physical examination by a doctor. If a deficiency is suspected, the next stage of diagnosis will normally be blood tests . A blood test can reveal the level of prothrombin, a clotting agent in the blood, which will be lower than average in the case of a vitamin K deficiency. However, as low levels of prothrombin can also be symptomatic of other conditions, the diagnosis will generally be confirmed with a vitamin K injection. If symptoms subside following the injection, the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency can be confirmed. 16 If you think that you or a loved one might have a vitamin K deficiency, start a free symptom assessment using the Ada app .",

    "vitamin_k_deficiency_faqs": "Q: What does vitamin K do? A: Vitamin K plays an important role in keeping the bones, heart and brain healthy. It is also essential for normal blood clotting, known as coagulation; low levels of vitamin K can cause a person to bleed excessively. For this reason, it is sometimes called “the blood clotting vitamin”. 18 Q: What is the most common cause of vitamin K deficiency? A: Vitamin K deficiency is most likely to occur in newborn infants, as a result of low levels of the vitamin being transferred from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, naturally low levels in breast milk, and the baby’s body experiencing difficulty making the vitamin on its own. However, most newborns are given a vitamin K supplement after birth to avoid complications. Vitamin K deficiency is rare in adults, but can be caused by malnutrition, certain prescription medication and conditions that lead to malabsorption. For more information, see the section on causes above. 15 Q: Why is vitamin K deficiency rare in adults? A: Low levels of vitamin K are rare in healthy adults because it is easy to obtain sufficient quantities of the vitamin by eating a balanced diet, and the body is able to produce some vitamin K on its own. 15 Q: What foods are high in vitamin K? A: Examples of good sources of vitamin K include: 18 Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale and lettuce Other vegetables like brussels sprouts, cabbage and broccoli Q: Does vitamin K deficiency cause bruising? A: Vitamin K deficiency can cause a person to bruise easily. However, there may be other causes of bruising. Vitamin K deficiency can also cause heavy bleeding. If you think that you or a loved one might have signs of vitamin K deficiency, try using the Ada app to find out more about your symptoms. Q: Can vitamin K deficiency cause anemia? A: Vitamin K deficiency in itself does not cause anemia. However, the heavy bleeding that can be a symptom of the deficiency, may sometimes be associated with anemia. Read more about Anemia » . Q: Can vitamin K deficiency cause hair loss? A: Hair loss is not a symptom of a lack of vitamin K. However, hair loss may sometimes be a symptom of anemia or a deficiency of another vitamin, such as vitamin D . Read more about Vitamin D Deficiency » . Q: How is vitamin K deficiency treated? A: Low levels of vitamin K in adults can often be treated with dietary changes to include more leafy green and other vegetables. Sometimes, a doctor may recommend vitamin K supplements, typically in the form of phytonadione tablets or injections. Newborn babies will usually receive a vitamin K shot to prevent deficiency. 15"
